# Contributing

We absolutely welcome any code contributions and we hope that this
guide will facilitate an understanding of the PyMAPDL code
repository. It is important to note that while the PyMAPDL software
package is maintained by ANSYS and any submissions will be reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can
support user questions and develop new features to make this software
a useful tool for all users.  As such, we welcome and encourage any
questions or submissions to this repository.


Information about contributing to PyMAPDL can be found in
