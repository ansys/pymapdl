.. _ref_how_to_add_an_example_reference_key:

============================
Adding a new gallery example
============================

This example is an example itself which demonstrates how to add new examples to the documentation.

Example location and naming
===========================

New examples should be added as Python scripts to:

``PyMAPDL/examples/XY-example-folder-name/``

.. note::
   Avoid creating new folders unless absolutely necessary. If in doubt put the example
   in the folder closest to what it is doing and its precise location can be advised
   on in the pull request. If you *must* create a new folder, make sure to add a
   ``README.txt`` containing a reference, a title and a single sentence description of the folder.
   Otherwise the new folder will be ignored by Sphinx.

Example file names should be in the format:

``XY-example-name.py``

Where ``XY`` is the number of the example. If there are already three examples numbered
``00``, ``01``, and ``02``, then your example must subsequently use the prefix ``03``.

Initial block of text
=====================
At the top of each example there should be a block comment that contains
the following parts:

Reference example
-----------------
Each example should have a reference tag/key in the form ``.. _ref_my_example:``.
For instance:

.. code:: py

   """

   .. _ref_my_example:

   ============================
   My new example title
   ============================

   This new example...

   """

The ``.. _ref_`` is necessary. Everything that follows is your reference tag. As
convention, we keep all references all in ``snake_case``.


Example description
-------------------
This section should give a brief overview of what the example is about or what it demonstrates.
The title should be changed to reflect the topic that your example covers.
A well-structured example should be divided in several parts.
The following lists gives you an idea of this division:

* Problem specification
* Problem description
* Launching MAPDL
* Build the geometry
* Model definition
* Mesh
* Boundary conditions
* Solution
* Review the results


After this preamble is complete, the first code block begins.

###############################################################################
#  Basic text formatting
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# RST provides several ways to format text:
#
# - **Bold**: Use double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` around
#   the text that you want to make bold. For example, `**my bold text**`.
# - *Italic*: Use single asterisks `*` or single underscores `_` around the
#   text that you want to italicize. For example, `_my italic text_`.
# - `Monospace`: Use single backticks \` around the text that you want to display
#   in monospace font. For example, `\`my monospace text\``.
#

###############################################################################
# Lists
# ~~~~~
#
# RST supports both ordered and unordered lists:
#
# 1. **Ordered List**:
#
#    .. code:: rst
#
#       #. Item 1
#       #. Item 2
#
#
# 2. **Unordered List**:
#
#    .. code:: rst
#
#       - Item 1
#       - Item 2
#

###############################################################################
# Equations and numbers
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To include equations or numbers, you can use the following syntax:
#
# - **Equations**:
#
#   .. code:: rst
#
#      .. math::
#          f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1
#
#
# - **Numbered Equations**:
#
#   .. code:: rst
#
#      .. math::
#          :number: 1
#
#          f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1
#

###############################################################################
# Code blocks
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To include code blocks in RST, use the double colons `::` followed by indentation:
#
# .. code:: rst
#
#    .. code:: python
#
#        def greet(name):
#            print("Hello, {}!".format(name))
#
#
# This renders as:
#
# .. code:: python
#
#     def greet(name):
#         print("Hello, {}!".format(name))
#

###############################################################################
# Section title
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Code blocks can be broken up with text "sections" which are interpreted as
# restructured text.
#
# This will also be translated into a markdown cell in the generated jupyter notebook.
# Sections can contain any information you may have regarding the example
# such as step-by-step comments or notes regarding motivations etc.
#
# To create a title or a section, underline it with the appropriate
# characters, such as``=``, ``*``, or ``~``.
# For example:
#
# .. code:: rst
#
#    ==========
#    My chapter
#    ==========
#
#    My text...
#
#    My section
#    ==========
#
#    My text...
#
#    My paragraph
#    ------------
#
#    My text
#
#
# It does not matter which character you use, but you need to be consistent
# through the whole document.
# For more information, see
# `RestructuredText Primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#sections>`_
# in the Sphinx documentation.
#
# As in Jupyter notebooks, if code is left unassigned at the end of a code block
# (as with ``mapdl`` in the previous block), the output is generated and
# printed to the screen according to its ``__repr__``.
# Otherwise, you can use ``print()`` to output the ``__str__``.

# more code...
mapdl.clear()
mapdl.prep7()
print(mapdl)

###############################################################################
# Plots and images
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# If you use an mapdl plotting command the result will be auto-generated and
# rendered in the page. Like so:

mapdl.block(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
mapdl.vplot()

###############################################################################
# Matplotlib plots are also rendered in HTML format.
#

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
x = list(range(10))
y = [i**2 + 3 * i - 1 for i in x]
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set_xlabel("x")
ax.set_ylabel("y")
plt.show()


###############################################################################
# Additionally you can reference images and figures using the ``image`` and
# ``figure`` directives:
#
# .. code:: rst
#
#    .. image:: path/to/image.extension
#       (options)
#
# and
#
# .. code:: rst
#
#    .. figure:: path/to/image.extension
#       (options)
#
# More information can be found
# `image <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#images>`_.
# and `figure <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#figure>`_

###############################################################################
# Making a pull request
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Once your example is complete and you've verified builds locally, you can make a pull request (PR).
# Branches containing examples should be prefixed with `doc/` as per the branch
# naming conventions found here: :ref:`contributing`.
#
# Note that you only need to create the python source example (.py).  The jupyter
# notebook, the example html and the demo script will all be auto-generated via ``sphinx-gallery``.

###############################################################################
# Stopping mapdl
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This block of code should be included always.

mapdl.exit()
