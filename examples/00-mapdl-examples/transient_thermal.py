Example Thermal Transient Analysis
----------------------------------
This example shows how you can use PyMAPDL to input a time dependent
temperature table to vary the temperature at a beam.  This uses
convection loads with independently varying convection coefficient and
bulk temperature.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Solve a transient analysis while ramping the load up and down.
#
# Note the solution time commands in the above code fragment. The
# final TIME is set to 1000 seconds. Time substep size is permitted to
# range from a minimum of 2 seconds to a maximum of 50 seconds in the
# DELTIM command. A first substep of 10 seconds is applied. Automatic
# time substep sizing will vary substeps between the extremes.
#
# A Table Array is used for the time-dependent Convection Coefficient
# values. Times go in the Zeroth column, while associated Convection
# Coefficients go in the First column.

# The Transient Thermal Solve
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This model is to be solved in one time step. For this reason, a
# ``TSRES`` command is used for force the solver to include a
# ``SOLVE`` at every time point in the two Table Arrays above. This
# ensures that the time-dependent curves are followed by the transient
# analysis. Intermediate solutions between the ``TSRES`` time points
# will be included according to the ``DELTIM`` command and the
# automatic time stepping decisions of the ANSYS solver.
#
# In this example, the times for the ``TSRES`` array illustrated above
# have been determined manually. A set of APDL commands could be used
# to automate this process for chosen Table Array entries, in more
# complex modeling situations, including checks that no time intervals
# are too short.
#
# Results at substeps will be wanted if the intermediate solutions of
# the time-transient analysis are to be available for post-processing
# review. The ``OUTRES`` command is used to control how much is written to
# the results file. In this example the OUTRES command will be used to
# simply write out all results for all substeps. In work with large
# models and may substeps, too much data will be written if such a
# strategy is employed for ``OUTRES``, and other options will need to be
# considered. Note that one option for the ``OUTRES`` command is to
# control times at which results are written with a Table Array, much
# as is used in the ``TSRES`` command, but typically for a larger number
# of time points, although including those of the TSRES array.
#
# The initial condition starting temperature is controlled for this
# example with the ``TUNIF`` command. Note that thermal transient
# analyses can also have a starting temperature profile formed by a
# static thermal ``SOLVE``. If a user neglects to set an initial
# temperature in ANSYS Mechanical APDL, a value of zero will be used,
# which is often not what is desired.
#
# The thermal convective loads are applied with an SF family
# command—in this example a convective load is applied to the end face
# of the solid model by the SFA command, using the Table Array entries
# for convection and bulk temperature that were developed above. The
# Table Array names are surrounded with percent signs (%).  A SOLVE is
# then performed.

# Force transient solve to include the times within the conv and bulk arrays
# my_tres = np.unique(np.vstack((my_bulk[:, 0], my_conv[:, 0])))[0]  # same as

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#
# Here, we use the ``get_value`` command which is very similar to the
# ``*GET`` command, except it immediately returns the value as a
# python accessible variable, rather than storing it to a MAPDL value.

# for example, the temperature of Node 12 is can be retrieved simply with:
mapdl.get_value("node", 12, "TEMP")

# note that this is similar to # *GET, Par, NODE, N, Item1, IT1NUM, Item2, IT2NUM
# See the MAPDL reference for all the items you can obtain using *GET
