        Mechanical APDL Command: `PARRES <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_PARRES.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Read operation:

              * ``NEW`` - Replace current parameter set with these parameters (default).

              * ``CHANGE`` - Extend current parameter set with these parameters, replacing any that already
              exist.

        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. The file name defaults to ``Jobname``.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). The extension defaults to PARM if ``Fname`` is
            blank.

        Notes
        -----
        Reads parameters from a coded file. The parameter file may have been written with the :ref:`parsav`
        command. The parameters read may replace or change the current parameter set.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Examples
        --------
        Read a local parameter file.

        >>> mapdl.parres('parm.PARM')
        """
        return self.run(f"PARRES, {lab}, {fname}, {ext}")

        Mechanical APDL Command: `PARSAV <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_PARSAV.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Write operation:

              * ``SCALAR`` - Write only scalar parameters (default).

              * ``ALL`` - Write scalar and array parameters. Parameters may be numeric or alphanumeric.

        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. The file name defaults to ``Jobname``.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). The extension defaults to PARM if ``Fname`` is
            blank.

        Notes
        -----
        Writes the current parameters to a coded file. Previous parameters on this file, if any, will be
        overwritten. The parameter file may be read with the :ref:`parres` command.

        :ref:`parsav` / :ref:`parres` operations truncate some long decimal strings, and can cause differing
        values in your solution data when other operations are performed. A good practice is to limit the
        number of decimal places you will use before and after these operations.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        par : str
            The name of the resulting parameter. See :ref:`starset` for name restrictions.

        entity : str
            Entity keyword. Valid keywords are NODE, ELEM, KP, LINE, AREA, VOLU, etc., as shown for
            ``Entity`` = in the tables below.

        entnum : str
            The number or label for the entity (as shown for ``ENTNUM`` = in the tables below). In some
            cases, a zero (or blank) ``ENTNUM`` represents all entities of the set.

        item1 : str
            The name of a particular item for the given entity. Valid items are as shown in the ``Item1``
            columns of the tables below.

        it1num : str
            The number (or label) for the specified ``Item1`` (if any). Valid ``IT1NUM`` values are as shown
            in the ``IT1NUM`` columns of the tables below. Some ``Item1`` labels do not require an
            ``IT1NUM`` value.

        item2 : str
            A second set of item labels and numbers to further qualify the item for which data are to be
            retrieved. Most items do not require this level of information.

        it2num : str
            A second set of item labels and numbers to further qualify the item for which data are to be
            retrieved. Most items do not require this level of information.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            Floating point value of the parameter.

        Notes
        -----
        :ref:`get` retrieves a value for a specified item and stores the value as a scalar parameter, or as
        a value in a user-named array parameter. An item is identified by various keyword, label, and number
        combinations. Usage is similar to the :ref:`starset` command except that the parameter values are
        retrieved from previously input or calculated results.

        :ref:`get` Usage :ref:`get` ,A,ELEM,5,CENT,X returns the centroid x location of element 5 and stores
        the result as parameter A.

        :ref:`get` command operations, and corresponding get functions, return values in the active
        coordinate system ( :ref:`csys` for input data or :ref:`rsys` for results data) unless stated
        otherwise.

        A get function is an alternative in-line function that can be used instead of the :ref:`get` command
        to retrieve a value. For more information, see.

        Both :ref:`get` and :ref:`starvget` retrieve information from the active data stored in memory. The
        database is often the source, and sometimes the information is retrieved from common memory blocks
        that the program uses to manipulate information. Although POST1 and POST26 operations use a
        ``\2.rst`` file, :ref:`get` data is accessed from the database or from the common blocks. Get
        operations do not access the ``\2.rst`` file directly. For repeated gets of sequential items, such as
        from a series of elements, see the :ref:`starvget` command.

        Most items are stored in the database after they are calculated and are available anytime
        thereafter. Items are grouped according to where they are usually first defined or calculated.
        Preprocessing data will often not reflect the calculated values generated from section data. Do not
        use :ref:`get` to obtain data from elements that use calculated section data, such as beams or
        shells.

        When the value retrieved by :ref:`get` is a component name, the resulting character parameter is
        limited to 32 characters. If the component name is longer than 32 characters, the remaining
        characters are ignored.

        Most of the general items listed below are available from all modules. Each of the sections for
        accessing :ref:`get` parameters are shown in the following order:

        The :ref:`get` command is valid in any processor.

        Examples
        --------
        Retrieve the number of nodes

        >>> value = mapdl.get('val', 'node', '', 'count')
        >>> value
        3003

        Retrieve the number of nodes using keywords.  Note that the
        parameter name is optional.

        Parameters
        ----------
        strarray : str, optional
            Name of the string array or parameter that will hold the returned values.
            Normally, if used in a python script you should just work with the
            return value from this method.
        func : str, optional

        arg1 : str, optional
            First argument. See notes for ``arg1`` definition.
        arg2 : str, optional
            Second argument. See notes for ``arg1`` definition.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            Value of the inquired item.

        Notes
        -----
        The ``/INQUIRE`` command is valid in any processor.

        .. warning::
        Take note that from version 0.60.4 and later, the command behaviour
        has been changed.
        Previously, the ``StrArray`` argument was omitted. For example:
        >>> mapdl.inquire('DIRECTORY')
        C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ansys_nynvxsaooh

        Now this will raise an exception.
        The default behaviour now, requires to input ``StrArray``:
        >>> mapdl.inquire('', 'DIRECTORY')
        C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ansys_nynvxsaooh

        **GENERAL FUNC OPTIONS**

        - ``LOGIN`` - Returns the pathname of the login directory on Linux
        systems or the pathname of the default directory (including
        drive letter) on Windows systems.
        - ``DOCU`` - Pathname of the ANSYS documentation directory.
        - ``APDL`` - Pathname of the ANSYS APDL directory.
        - ``PROG`` - Pathname of the ANSYS executable directory.
        - ``AUTH`` - Pathname of the directory in which the license file resides.
        - ``USER`` - Name of the user currently logged-in.
        - ``DIRECTORY`` - Pathname of the current directory.
        - ``JOBNAME`` - Current Jobname.
        - ``RSTDIR`` - Result file directory.
        - ``RSTFILE`` - Result file name.
        - ``RSTEXT`` - Result file extension.
        - ``OUTPUT`` - Current output file name.

        **RETURNING THE VALUE OF AN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE TO A PARAMETER**

        If ``FUNC=ENV``, the command format is ``/INQUIRE,StrArray,ENV,ENVNAME,Substring``.
        In this instance, ENV specifies that the command should return the
        value of an environment variable.
        The following defines the remaining fields:

        Envname:
        Specifies the name of the environment variable.

        Substring:
        If ``Substring = 1``, the first substring (up to the first colon (:)) is returned.
        If ``Substring = 2``, the second substring is returned, etc. For Windows platforms,
        the separating character is semicolon (;).
        If this argument is either blank or 0, the entire value of the environment
        variable is returned.

        **RETURNING THE VALUE OF A TITLE TO A PARAMETER**

        If ``FUNC = TITLE``, the command format is ``/INQUIRE,StrArray,TITLE,Title_num``.
        In this context, the value of Title_num can be blank or ``1`` through ``5``. If the
        value is ``1`` or blank, the title is returned. If the value is ``2`` through ``5``,
        a corresponding subtitle is returned (``2`` denoting the first subtitle, and so on).

        **RETURNING INFORMATION ABOUT A FILE TO A PARAMETER**

        The ``/INQUIRE`` command can also return information about specified files
        within the file system.
        For these capabilities, the format is ``/INQUIRE,Parameter,FUNC,Fname, Ext, --``.
        The following defines the fields:

        Parameter:
        Name of the parameter that will hold the returned values.

        Func:
        Specifies the type of file information returned:

        EXIST:
        Returns a ``1`` if the specified file exists, and ``0`` if it does not.

        DATE:
        Returns the date stamp of the specified file in the format ``\2yyyymmdd.hhmmss*``.

        SIZE:
        Returns the size of the specified file in MB.

        WRITE:
        Returns the status of the write attribute. A ``0`` denotes no write permission while a ``1`` denotes
        write permission.

        READ:
        Returns the status of the read attribute. A ``0`` denotes no read permission while a ``1`` denotes read
        permission.

        EXEC:
        Returns the status of the execute attribute (this has meaning only on Linux). A ``0`` denotes no
        execute permission while a ``1`` denotes execute permission.

        LINES:
        Returns the number of lines in an ASCII file.

        Fname:
        File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
        directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
        can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        Ext:
        Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        Examples
        --------
        Return the MAPDL working directory
        >>> mapdl.inquire('', 'DIRECTORY')
        C:\\Users\\gayuso\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ansys_nynvxsaooh

        Or

        >>> mapdl.inquire()
        C:\\Users\\gayuso\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ansys_nynvxsaooh

        Return the job name

        >>> mapdl.inquire('', 'JOBNAME')

        Parameters
        ----------
        par : str
            An alphanumeric name used to identify this parameter. ``Par`` can contain up to 32 characters,
            beginning with a letter and containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Examples:  ABC
            A3X TOP_END

            Command names, function names, label names, component and assembly names, etc., are invalid, as
            are parameter names beginning with an underscore (for example, _LOOP ).

            Parameter names ending in an underscore are not listed by the :ref:`starstatus` command. Array
            parameter names must be followed by a subscript, and the entire expression must be 32 characters
            or less. Examples:  A(1,1) NEW_VAL(3,2,5) RESULT(1000)

            There is no character parameter substitution for the ``Par`` field. Table parameters used in
            command fields (where constant values are normally given) are limited to 32 characters.

        value : str
            Numerical value or alphanumeric character string (up to 32 characters enclosed in single quotes)
            to be assigned to this parameter. Examples: A(1,3)=7.4 B='ABC3' Can also be a parameter or a
            parametric expression. Examples:  C=A(1,3) A(2,2)=(C+4)/2 . If ``VALUE`` is the table array
            name, the subscripts are the values of the primary variables and the table is evaluated at these
            specified index values.

            If blank, delete this parameter. Example:  A= deletes parameter A .

        val2 : str
            If ``Par`` is an array parameter, values ``VAL2`` through ``VAL10`` (up to the last nonblank
            value) are sequentially assigned to the succeeding array elements of the column. Examples:
            *SET,A(1,4),10,11 assigns A(1,4)=10, A(2,4)=11, and *SET,B(2,3),'file10','file11' assigns

            *SET,A(1,4),10,11 assigns A(1,4)=10, A(2,4)=11, and *SET,B(2,3),'file10','file11' assigns
            B(2,3)='file10', B(3,3)='file11' .

        val5 : str
            If ``Par`` is an array parameter, values ``VAL2`` through ``VAL10`` (up to the last nonblank
            value) are sequentially assigned to the succeeding array elements of the column. Examples:

        Notes
        -----
        Assigns values to user-named parameters that can be substituted later in the run. The equivalent
        (and recommended) format is ``Par`` = ``VALUE``, ``VAL2``, ``VAL3``, ..., ``VAL10``

        which can be used in place of :ref:`starset`, ``Par``, ... for convenience.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters (numeric or character) can be scalars (single valued) or arrays (multiple valued in one,
        two, or three dimensions). An unlimited number of parameter names can be defined in any run. For
        very large numbers of parameters, it is most efficient to define them in alphabetical order.

        Parameter values can be redefined at any time. Array parameters can also be assigned values within a
        do-loop ( :ref:`do` ) for convenience. Internally programmed do-loop commands are also available
        with the **\*V** ``XX``  commands ( :ref:`vfill` ). Parameter values (except for parameters ending in
        an underscore) can be listed with the :ref:`starstatus` command, displayed via :ref:`starvplot`
        (numeric parameters only), and modified via :ref:`vedit` (numeric parameters only).

        Older program-provided macro files can use parameter names that do not begin with an underscore.
        Using these macros embedded in your own macros may cause conflicts if the same parameter names are
        used.

        Parameters can also be resolved in comments created via :ref:`com`. A parameter can be deleted by
        redefining it with a blank ``VALUE``. If the parameter is an array, the entire array is deleted.
        Parameters can also be defined by a response to a query via ``\*ASK`` or from a Mechanical APDL-
        provided value via :ref:`get`.

        Array parameters must be dimensioned ( :ref:`dim` ) before being assigned values unless they are the
        result of an array operation or defined using the implied loop convention.

        Undefined scalar parameters are initialized to a near-zero value. Numeric array parameters are
        initialized to zero when dimensioned, and character array parameters are initialized to blank.

        An existing array parameter must be deleted before it can be redimensioned.

        Array parameter names must be followed by a subscript list (enclosed in parentheses) identifying the
        element of the array. The subscript list can have one, two, or three values (separated by commas).
        Typical array parameter elements are A(1,1), NEW_VAL(3,2,5), RESULT(1000). Subscripts for defining
        an array element must be integers (or parameter expressions that evaluate to integers). Non-integer
        values are rounded to the nearest integer value.

        All array parameters are stored as 3D arrays with the unspecified dimensions set to 1. For example,
        the 4th array element of a 1-dimensional array, A(4), is stored as array element A(4,1,1).

        Arrays adhere to standard FORTRAN conventions.

        If the parameter name ``Par`` is input in a numeric argument of a command, the numeric value of the
        parameter (as assigned with :ref:`starset`, :ref:`get`, =, etc.) is substituted into the command
        at that point. Substitution occurs only if the parameter name is used between blanks, commas,
        parentheses, or arithmetic operators (or any combination) in a numeric argument. Substitution can be
        prevented by enclosing the parameter name ``Par`` within single quotes ( ' ), if the parameter is
        alone in the argument; if the parameter is part of an arithmetic expression, the entire expression
        must be enclosed within single quotes to prevent substitution. In either case the character string
        will be used instead of the numeric value (and the string will be taken as 0.0 if it is in a numeric
        argument).

        A forced substitution is available in the text fields of :ref:`title`, :ref:`stitle`,
        :ref:`tlabel`, :ref:`an3d`, :ref:`syp` ( ``ARG1`` -- ``ARG8`` ), and :ref:`abbr` by enclosing the
        parameter within percent (%) signs. Also, parameter substitution can be forced within the file name
        or extension fields of commands having these fields by enclosing the parameter within percent (%)
        signs. Array parameters ( :ref:`dim` ) must include a subscript (within parentheses) to identify the
        array element whose value is to be substituted, such as A(1,3). Out-of-range subscripts result in an
        error message. Non-integer subscripts are allowed when identifying a TABLE array element for
        substitution. A proportional linear interpolation of values among the nearest array elements is
        performed before substitution. Interpolation is done in all three dimensions.

        Interpolation is based upon the assigned index numbers which must be defined when the table is
        filled ( :ref:`dim` ).

        Most alphanumeric arguments permit the use of character parameter substitution. When the parameter
        name ``Par`` input, the alphanumeric value of the parameter is substituted into the command at that
        point. Substitution can be suppressed by enclosing the parameter name within single quotes ( ' ).
        Forced substitution is available in some fields by enclosing the parameter name within percent (%)
        signs. Valid forced substitution fields include command name fields, ``Fname`` (filename) or ``Ext``
        (extension) arguments, :ref:`abbr` command ( ``Abbr`` arguments), :ref:`title` and :ref:`stitle`
        commands ( ``Title`` argument) and :ref:`tlabel` command ( ``Text`` argument). Character parameter
        substitution is also available in the ``\*ASK``, :ref:`an3d`, :ref:`cfwrite`, ``\*IF``,
        :ref:`elseif`, :ref:`msg`, :ref:`starset`, :ref:`use`, :ref:`vread`, and :ref:`vwrite`
        commands. Character array parameters must include a subscript (within parentheses) to identify the
        array element whose value is to be substituted.

        If a parameter operation expression is input in a numeric argument, the numeric value of the
        expression is substituted into the command
        at that point. Allowable operation expressions are of the form E1oE2oE3 ...oE10

        where E1, E2, etc. are expressions connected by operators (o). The allowable operations (o) are + -
        * / ** < >

        For example, A+B**C/D\*E is a valid operation expression. The * represents multiplication and the **
        represents exponentiation.

        Exponentiation of a negative number (without parentheses) to an integer power follows standard
        FORTRAN hierarchy conventions; that is, the positive number is exponentiated and then the sign is
        attached. Thus, -4**2 is evaluated as -16. If parentheses are applied, such as (-4)**2, the result
        is 16.

        A parameter is evaluated as a number within parentheses before exponentiation. Exponentiation of a
        negative number to a non-integer power is performed by exponentiating the positive number and
        prepending the minus sign, for example, -4**2.3 is -(4**2.3). The < and > operators allow
        conditional substitution. For example, E1<E2 substitutes the value of E1 if the comparison is true
        or the value of E2 if the comparison is false.

        Do not use spaces around operation symbols, as " *" (a space and a star) makes the remainder of the
        line a comment. Operation symbols (or symbols and signs) cannot be immediately adjacent to each
        other. Parentheses can be used to separate symbols and signs, to determine a hierarchy of
        operations, or for clarity. For example, use A**(-B) instead of A**-B. Numbers ending with +0nn or
        -0nn are assumed to be of exponential form (as written on files by some computer systems) so that
        123-002 is 123E-2 while 123-2 is 121. Avoid inputting this form of exponential data directly. The
        default hierarchy follows the standard FORTRAN conventions, namely:

        operations in parentheses (innermost first)
        then exponentiation (right to left)
        then multiplication or division (left to right)
        then unary association (such as +A or -A)
        then addition or subtraction (left to right)
        then logical evaluations (left to right).

        Expressions (E) can be a constant, a parameter, a function, or another operation expression (of the
        form E1oE2oE3 ...oE10). Functions are of the form FTN(A) where the argument (A) can itself be of the
        form E1oE2oE3 ...oE10. Operations are recursive to a level of four deep (three levels of internally
        nested parentheses). Iterative floating point parameter arithmetic should not be used for high
        precision input because of the accumulated numerical round off-error. Up to 10 expressions are
        accepted within a set of parenthesis.

        Valid functions (which are based on standard FORTRAN functions where possible) are:

        InformalTables need to be added.
        Function arguments ( X, Y, etc.) must be enclosed within parentheses and can be numeric values,
        parameters, or expressions.
        Input arguments for angular functions must evaluate to radians by default. Output from angular
        functions are also in radians by default. See :ref:`afun` to use degrees instead of radians for the
        angular functions. See :ref:`vfun` for applying these parameter functions to a sequence of array
        elements. Additional functions, called get functions, are described via :ref:`get`.

        ----------
        par : str
            Specifies the parameter or sets of parameters listed. For array parameters, use ``IMIN``, ``IMAX``, etc. to specify ranges. Use :ref:`dim` to define array parameters. Use :ref:`vedit` to review array parameters interactively. Use :ref:`vwrite` to print array values in a formatted output. If ``Par`` is blank, list all scalar parameter values, array parameter dimensions, and abbreviations. If ARGX, list the active set of local macro parameters (ARG1 to ARG9 and AR10 to AR99) ( :ref:`use` ).

            The following are possible values for ``Par``

              * ```` - Lists all parameters (except local macro parameters and those with names beginning or
              ending with an underbar) and toolbar abbreviations.

              * ``_PRM`` - Lists only parameters with names beginning with an underbar (_). These are Mechanical APDL
              internal parameters.

              * ``PRM_`` - Lists only parameters with names ending with an underbar (_). A good APDL programming
              convention is to ensure that all parameters created by your system programmer are named with a
              trailing underbar.

              * ``ABBR`` - Lists all toolbar abbreviations.

              * ``PARM`` - Lists all parameters (except local macro parameters and those with names beginning or
              ending with an underbar).

              * ``MATH`` - Lists all APDL Math parameters, including vectors, matrices, and linear solvers.

              * ``PARNAME`` - Lists only the parameter specified. ``PARNAME`` cannot be a local macro parameter
              name.

              * ``ARGX`` - Lists all local macro parameter values (ARG1- AR99) that are non-zero or non-blank.

            To list the index values specified with ``nAxis``, issue ``Val1`` = LIST. If ``Val1`` = LIST,
            ``Val2`` - ``Val10`` are ignored.

        Notes
        -----
        :ref:`taxis` is a convenient method to define table index values. These values reside in the zero
        column, row, etc. Instead of filling values in these zero location spots, use the :ref:`taxis`
        command. For example,

        .. code:: apdl

           *TAXIS,longtable(1,4,1,1),2,1.0,2.2,3.5,4.7,5.9

        would fill index values 1.0, 2.2, 3.5, 4.7, and 5.9 in ``nAxis`` 2 (column location), starting at
        location 4.

        To list index numbers, issue :ref:`taxis`, ``ParmLoc``, ``nAxis``, LIST, where ``nAxis`` = 1
        through 5 or ALL.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parr : str
            The name of the resulting array parameter vector. See :ref:`starset` for name restrictions. The
            parameter must exist as a dimensioned array ( :ref:`dim` ). String arrays are limited to a
            maximum of 8 characters.

        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. If the ``Fname`` field is left blank, reading
            continues from the current input device, such as the terminal.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        label : str
            Can take a value of IJK, IKJ, JIK, JKI, KIJ, KJI, or blank (IJK).

        n1 : str
            Read as ((( ``ParR`` (i,j,k), k = 1,n1), i = 1, n2), j = 1, n3) for ``Label`` = KIJ. ``n2`` and
            ``n3`` default to 1.

        n2 : str
            Read as ((( ``ParR`` (i,j,k), k = 1,n1), i = 1, n2), j = 1, n3) for ``Label`` = KIJ. ``n2`` and
            ``n3`` default to 1.

        n3 : str
            Read as ((( ``ParR`` (i,j,k), k = 1,n1), i = 1, n2), j = 1, n3) for ``Label`` = KIJ. ``n2`` and
            ``n3`` default to 1.

        nskip : str
            Number of lines at the beginning of the file being read that will be skipped during the reading.
            Default = 0.

        Notes
        -----
        Reads data from a file and fills in an array parameter vector or matrix. Data are read from a
        formatted file or, if the menu is off ( :ref:`menu` ,OFF) and ``Fname`` is blank, from the next
        input lines. The format of the data to be read must be input immediately following the :ref:`vread`
        command. The format specifies the number of fields to be read per record, the field width, and the
        placement of the decimal point (if none specified in the value). The read operation follows the
        available FORTRAN FORMAT conventions of the system (see your system FORTRAN manual). Any standard
        FORTRAN real format (such as (4F6.0), (E10.3,2X,D8.2), etc.) or alphanumeric format (A) may be used.
        Alphanumeric
        strings are limited to a maximum of 8 characters for any field (A8). For storage of string arrays
        greater than 8 characters, the \*SREAD command can be used. Integer (I) and list-directed (\2)
        descriptors may not be used. The parentheses must be included in the format and the format must not
        exceed 80 characters (including parentheses). The input line length is
        limited to 128 characters.

        A starting array element number must be defined for the result array parameter vector (numeric or
        character). For example, entering these two lines:

        .. code:: apdl

           *VREAD,A(1),ARRAYVAL
           (2F6.0)

        will read two values from each line of file ARRAYVAL and assign the values to A(1), A(2), A(3), etc.
        Reading continues until successive row elements ( :ref:`vlen`, :ref:`vmask`, :ref:`dim` ) are
        filled.

        For an array parameter matrix, a starting array element row and column number must be defined. For
        example, entering these two lines:

        .. code:: apdl

           *VREAD,A(1,1),ARRAYVAL,,,IJK,10,2
           (2F6.0)

        will read two values from each line of file ARRAYVAL and assign the values to A(1,1), A(2,1),
        A(3,1), etc. Reading continues until ``n1`` (10) successive row elements are filled. Once the
        maximum row number is reached, subsequent data will be read into the next column (for example,
        A(1,2), A(2,2), A(3,2), etc.)

        For numerical parameters, absolute values and scale factors may be applied to the result parameter (
        :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact` ). Results may be cumulative ( :ref:`vcum` ). See the :ref:`voper`
        command for details. If you are in the GUI the :ref:`vread` command must be contained in an
        externally prepared file read into Mechanical APDL (that is, :ref:`use`, :ref:`input`, etc.).

        This command is not applicable to 4- or 5-D arrays.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parr : str
            The name of the resulting vector array parameter. See :ref:`starset` for name restrictions. The
            program creates the array parameter if it does not exist.

        entity : str
            Entity keyword. Valid keywords are NODE, ELEM, KP, LINE, AREA, VOLU, etc. as shown for
            ``Entity`` = in the tables below.

        entnum : str
            The number of the entity (as shown for ``ENTNUM`` = in the tables below).

        item1 : str
            The name of a particular item for the given entity. Valid items are as shown in the ``Item1``
            columns of the tables below.

        it1num : str
            The number (or label) for the specified ``Item1`` (if any). Valid ``IT1NUM`` values are as shown
            in the ``IT1NUM`` columns of the tables below. Some ``Item1`` labels do not require an
            ``IT1NUM`` value.

        item2 : str
            A second set of item labels and numbers to further qualify the item for which data is to be
            retrieved. Most items do not require this level of information.

        it2num : str
            A second set of item labels and numbers to further qualify the item for which data is to be
            retrieved. Most items do not require this level of information.

        kloop : str
            Field to be looped on:

              * ``0 or 2`` - Loop on the ``ENTNUM`` field (default).

              * ``3`` - Loop on the ``Item1`` field.

              * ``4`` - Loop on the ``IT1NUM`` field. Successive items are as shown with ``IT1NUM``.

              * ``5`` - Loop on the ``Item2`` field.

              * ``6`` - Loop on the ``IT2NUM`` field. Successive items are as shown with ``IT2NUM``.

        Notes
        -----
        Retrieves values for specified items and stores the values in an output vector of a user-named array
        parameter according to: ``ParR`` = f( ``Entity``, ``ENTNUM``, ``Item1``, ``IT1NUM``, ``Item2``,
        ``IT2NUM`` )

        where (f) is the :ref:`get` function; ``Entity``, ``Item1``, and ``Item2`` are keywords; and
        ``ENTNUM``, ``IT1NUM``, and ``IT2NUM`` are numbers or labels corresponding to the keywords.
        Looping continues over successive entity numbers ( ``ENTNUM`` ) for the ``KLOOP`` default. For
        example, :ref:`starvget`,A(1),ELEM,5,CENT,X returns the centroid x-location of element 5 and stores
        the result in the first location of A. Retrieving continues with element 6, 7, 8, etc., regardless
        of whether the element exists or is selected, until successive array locations are filled. Use
        :ref:`vlen` or :ref:`vmask` to skip locations. Absolute values and scale factors may be applied to
        the result parameter ( :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact` ). Results may be cumulative ( :ref:`vcum` ). See
        the :ref:`voper` command for general details. Results can be put back into an analysis by writing a
        file of the desired input commands with the :ref:`vwrite` command. See also the :ref:`starvput`
        command.

        Both :ref:`get` and :ref:`starvget` retrieve information from the active data stored in memory. The
        database is often the source, and sometimes the information is retrieved from common memory blocks
        that Mechanical APDL uses to manipulate information. Although POST1 and POST26 operations use a
        ``\2.rst`` file, GET data is accessed from the database or from the common blocks. Get operations do
        not access the ``\2.rst`` file directly.

        The :ref:`starvget` command retrieves both the unprocessed real and the imaginary parts (original
        and duplicate sector nodes and elements) of a `cyclic symmetry
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/cycsym_example.html>`_ solution.

              * ```` - When ``Val1`` is ALL, a (blank) value for ``Val2`` causes all user-defined parameters to
              be deleted.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a command generally created by the graphical user interface (GUI). It appears in the log
        file ( ``Jobname.LOG`` ) if an array parameter is deleted from within the Array Parameters dialog.

        Usage examples:

        Delete all user-defined parameters: :ref:`stardel` ,ALL
        Delete only those user-defined parameters named with a trailing underscore: :ref:`stardel` ,,PRM
        Delete all user-defined and all system parameters (except for _STATUS and _RETURN): :ref:`stardel`
        ,ALL,_PRM
        Delete a parameter by specifying its location within the Array Parameters dialog: :ref:`stardel` ,,
        ``LOC``
        Delete a single specified parameter by name: :ref:`stardel`, ``ParmName`` (You cannot specify more
        than one named parameter at a time.)

        The :ref:`stardel` command does not free up memory but only deletes the specified reference. For
        example, memory usage increases from the continued issuance of :ref:`stardel` and :ref:`dim` within
        :ref:`dowhile` loops, as arrays are stored in the database (memory) and :ref:`stardel` removes only
        the ``reference`` to the array. To release the memory in use, issue the :ref:`save` command after
        :ref:`stardel`.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        par : str
            Name of parameter to be dimensioned. See :ref:`starset` for name restrictions.

        type_ : str
            Array type:

              * ``ARRAY`` - Arrays are similar to standard FORTRAN arrays (indices are integers) (default).
              Index numbers for the rows, columns, and planes are sequential values beginning with one. Used for
              1-, 2-, or 3D arrays.

              * ``ARR4`` - Same as ARRAY, but used to specify 4-D arrays.

              * ``ARR5`` - Same as ARRAY, but used to specify 5-D arrays.

              * ``CHAR`` - Array entries are character strings (up to 8 characters each). Index numbers for
              rows, columns, and planes are sequential values beginning with one.

              * ``TABLE`` - Array indices are real (non-integer) numbers which must be defined when filling the
              table. Index numbers for the rows and columns are stored in the zero column and row "array
              elements" and are initially assigned a near-zero value. Index numbers must be in ascending order
              and are used only for retrieving an array element. When retrieving an array element with a real
              index that does not match a specified index, linear interpolation is done among the nearest
              indices and the corresponding array element values ( :ref:`starset` ). Used for 1-, 2-, or 3D
              tables.

              * ``TAB4`` - Same as TABLE, but used to specify 4-D tables.

              * ``TAB5`` - Same as TABLE, but used to specify 5-D tables.

              * ``STRING`` - Array entries are character strings (up to IMAX each). Index numbers for columns
              and planes are sequential values beginning with 1. Row index is character position in string.

        imax : str
            Extent of first dimension (row). (For ``Type`` = STRING, ``IMAX`` is rounded up to the next
            multiple of eight and has a limit of 248). Default = 1.

        jmax : str
            Extent of second dimension (column). Default = 1.

        kmax : str
            Extent of third dimension (plane). Default = 1.

        var1 : str
            Variable name corresponding to the first dimension (row) for ``Type`` = TABLE, TAB4, or TAB5.
            Default = Row.

        var2 : str
            Variable name corresponding to the second dimension (column) for ``Type`` = TABLE, TAB4, or
            TAB5. Default = Column.

        var3 : str
            Variable name corresponding to the third dimension (plane) for ``Type`` = TABLE, TAB4, TAB5.
            Default = Plane.

        csysid : str
            An integer corresponding to the coordinate system ID number. Default = 0 (global Cartesian).

        Notes
        -----
        Up to three dimensions (row, column, and plane) may be defined using ARRAY and TABLE. Use ARR4,
        ARR5, TAB4, and TAB5 to define up to five dimensions (row, column, plane, book, and shelf). An index
        number is associated with each row, column, and plane. For array and table type parameters, element
        values are initialized to zero. For character and string parameters, element values are initialized
        to (blank). A defined parameter must be deleted ( :ref:`starset` ) before its dimensions can be
        changed. Scalar (single valued) parameters should not be dimensioned. :ref:`dim`,A,,3 defines a
        vector array with elements A(1), A(2), and A(3). :ref:`dim`,B,,2,3 defines a 2x3 array with
        elements B(1,1), B(2,1), B(1,2), B(2,2), B(1,3), and B(2,3). Use :ref:`starstatus`, ``Par`` to
        display elements of array ``Par``. You can write formatted data files (tabular formatting) from
        data held in arrays through the :ref:`vwrite` command.

        If you use table parameters to define boundary conditions, then ``Var1``, ``Var2``, and/or
        ``Var3`` can either specify a primary variable (listed in ) or can be an independent parameter. If
        specifying an independent parameter, then you must define an additional table for the independent
        parameter. The additional table must have the same name as the independent parameter and may be a
        function of one or more primary variables or another independent parameter. All independent
        parameters must relate to a primary variable.

        Tabular load arrays can be defined in both global Cartesian (default), cylindrical, spherical, or
        local (see below) coordinate systems by specifying ``CSYSID``, as defined in :ref:`local`.
        Coordinate system ``CSYSID`` must exist prior to issuing the :ref:`dim` command.

        **The following constraints apply when specifying a local coordinate system for your tabular
        loads:**

        Only Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems are supported
        Angle values for Y in cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems must be input in degrees and must
        be positive values between 0 and 360 degrees (0 :math:``  Y  :math:``  360)
        Angle values for Z in spherical coordinate system must be input in degrees and must be positive
        values between -90 and +90 ( -90 :math:``  Z  :math:``  90)

        If specifying a 4- or 5-D array or table, four additional fields ( ``LMAX``, ``MMAX``, ``Var4``,
        and ``Var5`` ) are available. Thus, for a 4-D table, the command syntax would be:

        .. code:: apdl

           *DIM,Par,Type,IMAX,JMAX,KMAX,LMAX,Var1,Var2,Var3,Var4,CSYSID

        For a 5-D table, the command syntax is:

        .. code:: apdl

           *DIM,Par,Type,IMAX,JMAX,KMAX,LMAX,MMAX,Var1,Var2,Var3,Var4,Var5,CSYSID

        You cannot create or edit 4- or 5-D arrays or tables via the GUI.

        For more information, see `Array Parameters
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_apdl/Hlp_P_APDL3_11.html#ansys.guide.apdl.ch3.s11.9>`_

        **\*DIM - Primary Variables**

        .. flat-table::
           :header-rows: 1

           * - Primary Variable

           * - Cyclic sector number
             - SECTOR

           * - Concentration
             - CONC


        Specify PRESSURE as the independent variable (not PRES).

        The X, Y, and Z coordinate locations listed above are valid in global Cartesian, or local
        (Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical) coordinate systems. The VELOCITY label is applicable only to
        the calculated fluid velocity in element FLUID116 .

        When using PRESSURE as a primary variable, the underlying element must have the pressure DOF
        associated with it, or it must be a supported contact element.

        The gap/penetration label (GAP) is only used for defining certain contact element real constants.

        The frequency label (FREQ) is valid for harmonic analyses only.

        The node and element labels (NODE and ELEM) allow you to use node and element numbers as primary
        variables, and their axis values should be integers.

        The OMEGS, ECCENT, and THETA primary variables only apply to the COMBI214 element. The amplitude of
        the rotational velocity (OMEGS) is an absolute value, so only positive
        values of OMEGS are valid. The eccentricity (ECCENT) and phase shift (THETA) labels are only valid
        for nonlinear analyses.

        If you use table parameters to define boundary conditions, the table names ( ``Par`` ) must not
        exceed 32 characters.

        In thermal analyses, if you apply tabular loads as a function of temperature but the rest of the
        model is linear (for example, includes no temperature-dependent material properties or radiation ),
        you should turn on Newton-Raphson iterations ( :ref:`nropt`,FULL) to evaluate the temperature-
        dependent tabular boundary conditions correctly.

        This command is valid in any processor.
