              * ``FORW`` - Forward FFT computation (default).

              * ``BACK`` - Backward FFT computation.

        inputdata : str
            Name of matrix or vector for which the FFT will be computed. This can be a dense matrix (created
            by the :ref:`dmat` command) or a vector (created by the :ref:`vec` command). Data can be real or
            complex values. There is no default value for this argument.

        outputdata : str
            Name of matrix or vector where the FFT results will be stored. The type of this argument must be
            consistent with ``InputData`` (see table below). There is no default value for this argument.

            InformalTables need to be added.

        dim1 : str
            The number of terms to consider for a vector, or the number of rows for a matrix. Defaults to
            the whole input vector or all the rows of the matrix.

        dim2 : str
            The number of columns to consider for a matrix. Defaults to all the columns of the matrix.
            (Valid only for matrices.)

        resultformat : str
            Specifies the result format:

              * ``FULL`` - Returns the full result. That is, the result matches the dimension specified on this
              command ( ``DIM1``, ``DIM2`` ).

              * ``PART`` - Returns partial results. For real input data, there is a symmetry in the results of
              the Fourier transform as some coefficients are conjugated. The partial format uses this symmetry
              to optimize the storage of the results. (Valid only for real data.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        matrix : str
            Name of the matrix to compress.

        algorithm : str
            Algorithm or method to use:

              * ``SVD`` - Singular value decomposition algorithm (default).

              * ``MGS`` - Modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm.

              * ``SPARSE`` - Compress a sparse matrix based on the threshold value.

        threshold : str
            Numerical threshold value used to manage the compression. The default value depends on the
            method of compression: 1E-7 for SVD; 1E-14 for MGS; 1E-16 for SPARSE.

        val1 : str
            The description of the argument is missing in the Python function. Please, refer to the `command

            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_COMP.html>`_ for further
            information.

        Notes
        -----
        The SVD and MGS algorithms are only applicable to dense matrices that were created using the
        :ref:`dmat` command. Columns that are linearly dependent on others are removed, leaving the
        independent or basis vectors. The matrix is resized according to the new size determined by the
        algorithm.

        For the SVD algorithm, the singular value decomposition of an input matrix :math:``  is a
        factorization of the form:

        M = U Î£ V *
        Here, the :math:``  matrix is replaced by the  :math:``  matrix, according to the specified
        threshold.

        The SPARSE compression method is only applicable to sparse matrices that were created using the
        :ref:`smat` command. All terms that have an absolute value below the specified threshold, relative
        to the maximum value in the matrix, are removed from the original matrix. For example, given a
        sparse matrix having 100 as the largest term and ``THRESHOLD`` = 0.5, all terms having an absolute
        value below 0.5\2100 = 50 are removed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        matrix : str
            Name of the matrix to export (must be a matrix previously created with :ref:`dmat` or
            :ref:`smat`, or a vector previously created with :ref:`vec` ).

            Format of the output file:

              * ``MMF`` - Export the matrix in the Matrix Market Format.

              * ``SUB`` - Export the matrix in the ``SUB`` file format.

              * ``HBMAT`` - Export the matrix in the Harwell-Boeing file format.

              * ``MAT`` - Export the matrix in a native format, to be re-imported using the :ref:`dmat` or
              :ref:`smat` command.

              * ``EMAT`` - Export the matrix to an existing ``EMAT`` file.

              * ``PS`` - Export the matrix profile to a Postscript file.

              * ``DMIG`` - Export the matrix in the ``DMIG`` file format.

              * ``CSV`` - Export the matrix to an ASCII CSV (comma-separated values) file.

        fname : str
            Name of the file (case-sensitive, 32-character maximum), or name of the array parameter if
            ``Format`` = APDL (no default) .

        val1 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val3`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Format``. See table below for details.

        val2 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val3`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Format``. See table below for details.

        val3 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val3`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Format``. See table below for details.

        Notes
        -----
        Only sparse matrices can be exported to Postscript files. This option plots the matrix profile as a
        series of dots.

        If you want to create a ``.SUB`` file from several matrices, you need to set ``Val3`` = WAIT for all
        matrices but the last, and ``Val3`` = DONE for the last one. The export will be effective at the
        last :ref:`export` command.

        To create a ``.SUB`` file or ``.DMIG`` file from scratch, you must supply the row information array.
        (Specify this array in the ``Val2`` field for ``.SUB`` or in the ``Val1`` field for ``.DMIG``.)
        This must be an ``m`` x 2 array, where ``m`` is the size of the matrix. The first column is the node
        number and the second column is the DOF number corresponding to each row of the matrix.

        When exporting an HBMAT file in ASCII format, you can include the matrix type in the header of the
        file by specifying the matrix type in the ``Val2`` field. The matrix type is not included in the
        header if ``Val2`` is empty. If ``Val1`` = BINARY, ``Val2`` is not used.

        The :ref:`export` command is not applicable to sparse matrices initialized from ``.FULL`` files by
        means of the NOD2SOLV option on the :ref:`smat` command (that is, :ref:`smat`
        ,,,IMPORT,FULL,,NOD2SOLV).

        The ``.CSV`` file format does not support sparse matrices.

            Name of vector containing the right-hand side (load) vectors as input. Must have been previously
            defined as a :ref:`vec` vector or a :ref:`dmat` matrix.

        solvector : str
            Name of vector that will contain the solution vectors upon completion. Must be predefined as a
            :ref:`vec` vector or :ref:`dmat` matrix.

        transkey : str
            Transpose key. Set ``TransKey`` = TRANS to solve the transposed linear system. If blank,
            transpose will not be used.

        Notes
        -----
        This command performs forward and back substitution to obtain the solution to the linear matrix
        equation Ax = b (or A :sup:`T` x = b if ``TransKey`` = TRANS). The matrix engine must have been
        previously defined using :ref:`lsengine`, and the matrix factored using :ref:`lsfactor` .

        You can use the :ref:`dmat` ,,,COPY (or :ref:`vec` ,,,COPY) command to copy the load vector to the
        solution vector in order to predefine it with the appropriate size.

        Parameters
        ----------
        matrix : str
            Name used to identify the matrix. Must be specified.

        type_ : str
            Matrix type:

              * ``D`` - Double precision real values (default).

              * ``Z`` - Complex double precision values.

              * ``I`` - Integer values.

        method : str
            Method used to create the matrix:

              * ``ALLOC`` - Allocate space for a matrix (default).

              * ``RESIZE`` - Resize an existing matrix to new row and column dimensions. Values are kept from
              the original matrix. If the dimensions specified by ``Val1`` (rows) and ``Val2`` (columns) are
              greater than the original matrix size, the additional entries are assigned a value of zero.

              * ``COPY`` - Copy an existing matrix.

              * ``LINK`` - Link to an existing matrix. The memory will be shared between the original matrix and
              the new matrix. This is useful for manipulating a submatrix of a larger matrix. The ``Val1``
              through ``Val5`` arguments will be used to specify the lower and upper bounds of row and column
              numbers from the original matrix.

              * ``IMPORT`` - Import the matrix from a file.

        val1 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val5`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Method``. See details below.

        val2 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val5`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Method``. See details below.

        val3 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val5`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Method``. See details below.

        val4 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val5`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Method``. See details below.

        val5 : str
            Additional input. The meaning of ``Val1`` through ``Val5`` will vary depending on the specified
            ``Method``. See details below.

        Notes
        -----
        This command allows you to create a dense matrix. To create a sparse matrix, use the :ref:`smat`
        command. :ref:`smat` is recommended for large matrices obtained from the ``.FULL`` or ``.HBMAT``
        file. Refer to the :ref:`hbmat` command documentation for more information about ``.FULL`` file
        contents.

        Use the :ref:`vec` command to create a vector.

        For very large matrices, use the OUTOFCORE option ( ``Method`` = ALLOC or COPY) to keep some of the
        matrix on disk if there is insufficient memory.

        When importing a dense matrix from a **DMIG** file, you can define the formatting of the file using
        the ``Val3`` and ``Val4`` fields. Here are a few different example of formats:

        A LARGE field format file (using ``Val3`` = ``LARGE``):

        .. code:: apdl

           ...
           DMIG*   KAAX                          21               2
           *                     21               1-2.261491337E+08
           ...

        A FREE field format file with blank separators (using ``Val4`` = ``S``):

        .. code:: apdl

           ...
           DMIG stiff 1 2 1 2 29988.
           1 6 149940. 2 2 -29988.
           2 6 149940.
           ...

        A FREE field format file with a comma separator (using ``Val4`` = ``,``):

        .. code:: apdl

           ...
           DMIG,KF,22321,3,,22321,2,-5.00E+6
           DMIG,KF,22320,3,,22320,2,-5.00E+6
           ...

        **Requirement when importing matrices from a Nastran DMIG file:** To ensure that the ``.sub`` file
        is properly generated from matrices imported from Nastran **DMIG** file, the generalized coordinates
        for a CMS superelement (SPOINTS in Nastran) must appear last (have
        highest ID number).
