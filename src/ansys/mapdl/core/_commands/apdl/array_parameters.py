        **Argument Descriptions**

        .. _a-MFOURI_argdescript:

        * ``oper : str`` - Type of Fourier operation:

          * ``FIT`` - Calculate Fourier coefficients ``COEFF`` from ``MODE``, ``ISYM``, ``THETA``, and
            ``CURVE``.

          * ``EVAL`` - Evaluate the Fourier curve ``CURVE`` from ``COEFF``, ``MODE``, ``ISYM`` and ``THETA``

        * ``coeff : str`` - Name of the array parameter vector containing the Fourier coefficients
          (calculated if ``Oper`` = FIT, required as input if ``Oper`` = EVAL). See :ref:`starset` for name
          restrictions.

        * ``mode : str`` - Name of the array parameter vector containing the mode numbers of the desired
          Fourier terms.

        * ``isym : str`` - Name of the array parameter vector containing the symmetry key for the
        corresponding Fourier terms.
          The vector should contain keys for each term as follows:

          * ``0 or 1`` - Symmetric (cosine) term

          * ``-1`` - Antisymmetric (sine) term.

        * ``theta, curve : str`` - Names of the array parameter vectors containing the theta vs. curve
          description, respectively. Theta values should be input in degrees. If ``Oper`` = FIT, one curve
          value should be supplied with each theta value. If ``Oper`` = EVAL, one curve value will be
          calculated for each theta value.

        .. _a-MFOURI_notes:

        Calculates the coefficients of a Fourier series for a given curve, or evaluates the Fourier curve
        from the given (or previously calculated) coefficients. The lengths of the ``COEFF``, ``MODE``, and
        ``ISYM`` vectors must be the same--typically two times the number of modes desired, since two terms
        (sine and cosine) are generally required for each mode. The lengths of the ``CURVE`` and ``THETA``
        vectors should be the same or the smaller of the two will be used. There should be a sufficient
        number of points to adequately define the curve--at least two times the number of coefficients. A
        starting array element number (1) must be defined for each array parameter vector. The vector
        specifications :ref:`vlen`, :ref:`vcol`, :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact`, and :ref:`vcum` do not apply to
        this command. Array elements should not be skipped with the :ref:`vmask` and the ``NINC`` value of
        the :ref:`vlen` specifications. The vector being calculated ( ``COEFF`` if ``Oper`` is FIT, or
        ``CURVE`` if ``Oper`` is EVAL) must exist as a dimensioned array ( :ref:`dim` ).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        **Argument Descriptions**

        .. _a-MFUN_argdescript:

        * ``parr : str`` - The name of the resulting array parameter matrix. See :ref:`starset` for name
          restrictions.

        * ``func : str`` - Copy or transpose function:

          * ``COPY`` - ``Par1`` is copied to ``ParR``

          * ``TRAN`` - ``Par1`` is transposed to ``ParR``. Rows (m) and columns (n) of ``Par1`` matrix are
            transposed to resulting ``ParR`` matrix of shape (n,m).

        * ``par1 : str`` - Array parameter matrix input to the operation.

        .. _a-MFUN_notes:

        Operates on one input array parameter matrix and produces one output array parameter matrix
        according to: ``ParR`` = f( ``Par1`` )

        where the function (f) is either a copy or transpose, as described above.

        Functions are based on the standard FORTRAN definitions where possible. ``ParR`` may be the same as
        ``Par1``. Starting array element numbers must be defined for each array parameter matrix if it does
        not start at the first location. For example, :ref:`mfun`,A(1,5),COPY,B(2,3) copies matrix B
        (starting at element (2,3)) to matrix A (starting at element (1,5)). The diagonal corner elements
        for each submatrix must be defined: the upper left corner by the array starting element (on this
        command), the lower right corner by the current values from the :ref:`vcol` and :ref:`vlen`
        commands. The default values are the (1,1) element and the last element in the matrix. No operations
        progress across matrix planes (in the 3rd dimension). Absolute values and scale factors may be
        applied to all parameters ( :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact` ). Results may be cumulative ( :ref:`vcum` ).
        Array elements should not be skipped with the :ref:`vmask` and the ``NINC`` value of the :ref:`vlen`
        specifications. The number of rows ( :ref:`vlen` ) applies to the ``Par1`` array. See the

        Parameters
        ----------
        parr : str
            The name of the resulting array parameter matrix. See :ref:`starset` for name restrictions.

        par1 : str
            First array parameter matrix input to the operation.

        oper : str
            Matrix operations. Usage of the ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` arguments varies for each operation, as
            described below:

            * ``INVERT`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, INVERT)

              Square matrix invert: Inverts the n x n matrix in Par1 into ParR. The matrix must be well
              conditioned.

              .. warning::

                  Non-independent or ill-conditioned equations can cause erroneous results.

              For large matrices, use the APDL Math operation :ref:`lsfactor` for efficiency (see `APDL Math
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_apdl/apdlmathex.html>`_

            * ``MULT`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, MULT, ``Par2`` )

              Matrix multiply: Multiplies ``Par1`` by ``Par2``. The number of rows of ``Par2`` must equal the
              number of columns of ``Par1`` for the operation. If ``Par2`` is input with a number of rows greater
              than the number of columns of ``Par1``, matrices are still multiplied. However, the operation only
              uses a number of rows of ``Par2`` equal to the number of columns of ``Par1``.

            * ``COVAR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, COVAR, ``Par2`` )

              Covariance: The measure of association between columns of the ``Par1`` input matrix. ``Par1`` of
              size m runs (rows) by n data (columns) is first processed to produce a row vector containing the
              mean of each column, which is transposed to the output column vector ``Par2`` of n array elements.
              The ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` operation then produces ``ParR``, a resulting n x n matrix of covariances
              (with the variances as the diagonal terms).

            * ``CORR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, CORR, ``Par2`` )

              Correlation: The correlation coefficient between columns of the ``Par1`` input matrix. ``Par1`` of
              size m runs (rows) by n data (columns) is first processed to produce a row vector containing the
              mean of each column, which is then transposed to the output column vector ``Par2`` of n array
              elements. The ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` operation then produces ``ParR``, a resulting n x n matrix of
              correlation coefficients (with a value of 1.0 for the diagonal terms).

            * ``SOLV`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, SOLV, ``Par2`` )

              Solution of simultaneous equations: Solves the set of ``n`` equations of ``n`` terms of the form
              a:sub:`n1` x:sub:`1` + a:sub:`n2` x:sub:`2` + :sup:`...` + a:sub:`nn` x:sub:`n` = b:sub:`n` where
              ``Par1`` contains the matrix of a-coefficients, ``Par2`` contains the vector(s) of b-values, and
              ``ParR`` contains the vector(s) of x-results. ``Par1`` must be a square matrix. The equations must
              be linear, independent, and well conditioned.

              .. warning::

                  Non-independent or ill-conditioned equations can cause erroneous results.

              For large matrices, use the APDL Math operation :ref:`lsfactor` for efficiency (see `APDL Math
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_apdl/apdlmathex.html>`_

            * ``SORT`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, SORT, ``Par2``, ``n1``, ``n2``, ``n3`` )

              Matrix sort: Sorts the columns of matrix ``Par1`` according to sort vector ``Par2`` and places the
              result back into ``Par1``. Rows of ``Par1`` are moved to the corresponding positions indicated by
              the values of ``Par2``. ``Par2`` may be a column of ``Par1`` (in which case it will also be
              reordered). Alternatively, you may specify the column of ``Par1`` to sort using ``n1`` (leaving
              ``Par2`` blank). A secondary sort can be specified by column ``n2``, and a third sort using column
              ``n3``. ``ParR`` is the vector of initial row positions (the permutation vector). Sorting ``Par1``
              according to ``ParR`` should reproduce the initial ordering.

            * ``NNEAR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, NNEAR, ``Toler`` )

              Nearest Node: Finds the nodes nearest to the given set of points in ``Par1``, where ``Par1`` is an n
              x 3 array of coordinate locations. ``ParR`` is a vector of the nearest selected nodes, or 0 if no
              nodes are nearer than ``Toler``. ``Toler`` defaults to 1 and is limited to the maximum model size.

            * ``ENEAR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, ENEAR, ``Toler`` )

              Nearest Element: Finds the elements nearest to the given set of points in ``Par1``, where ``Par1``
              is an n x 3 array of coordinate locations. ``ParR`` is a vector of the nearest selected elements, or
              0 if no element centroids are nearer than ``Toler``. ``Toler`` defaults to 1 and is limited to the
              maximum model size.

            * ``MAP`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, MAP, ``Par2``, ``Par3``, ``kDim``, ``--``, ``kOut``,
              ``LIMIT`` )

              Maps the results from one set of points to another. For example, you can map pressures from a CFD
              analysis onto your model for a structural analysis.

              ``Par1`` is the Nout x 3 array of points that will be mapped to. ``Par2`` is the Nin x M array that
              contains M values of data to be interpolated at each point and corresponds to the Nin x 3 points in
              ``Par3``. The resulting ``ParR`` is the Nout x M array of mapped data points.

              For each point in the destination mesh, all possible triangles in the source mesh are searched to
              find the best triangle containing each point. It then does a linear interpolation inside this
              triangle. You should carefully specify your interpolation method and search criteria in order to
              provide faster and more accurate results (see ``LIMIT``, below).

              ``kDim`` is the interpolation criteria. If ``kDim`` = 2 or 0, two dimensional interpolation is
              applied (interpolate on a surface). If ``kDim`` = 3, three dimensional interpolation is applied
              (interpolate on a volume).

              ``kOut`` specified how points outside of the domain are handled. If ``kOut`` = 0, use the value(s)
              of the nearest region point for points outside of the region. If ``kOut`` = 1, set results outside
              of the region to zero.

              ``LIMIT`` specifies the number of nearby points considered for interpolation. The default is 20, and
              the minimum is 5. Lower values will reduce processing time; however, some distorted or irregular
              sets of points will require a higher ``LIMIT`` value to encounter three nodes for triangulation.

              Output points are incorrect if they are not within the domain (area or volume) defined by the
              specified input points. Also, calculations for out-of-bound points require much more processing time
              than do points that are within bounds. Results mapping is available from the command line only.

            * ``INTP`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, INTP, ``Par2`` )

              Finds the elements that contain each point in the array of n x 3 points in ``Par1``. ``Par2`` will
              contain the set of element ID numbers and ``ParR`` will contain their n x 3 set of natural element
              coordinates (values between -1 and 1). ``Par1`` must be in global Cartesian coordinates.

            * ``SGET`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, SGET, ``Par2``, ``Label``, ``Comp`` )

              Gets the nodal solution item corresponding to ``Label`` and ``Comp`` (see the :ref:`plnsol` command)
              and interpolates it to the given element locations. ``Par1`` contains the n x 3 array of natural
              element coordinates (values between -1 and 1) of the n element ID numbers in ``Par2``. ``Par1`` and
              ``Par2`` are usually the output of the :ref:`moper`,,,INTP operation. ``ParR`` contains the n
              interpolated results.

        val1 : str
            Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` vary depending
            on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper`` for details.

        val2 : str
            Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` vary depending
            on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper`` for details.

        val3 : str
            Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` vary depending
            on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper`` for details.

        val4 : str
            Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` vary depending
            on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper`` for details.

        val5 : str
            Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` vary depending
            on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper`` for details.

        val6 : str
            Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1`` through ``Val6`` vary depending
            on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper`` for details.

            size m runs (rows) by n data (columns) is first processed to produce a row vector containing the
            mean of each column, which is transposed to the output column vector ``Par2`` of n array elements.
            The ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` operation then produces ``ParR``, a resulting n x n matrix of covariances
            (with the variances as the diagonal terms).

          * ``CORR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, CORR, ``Par2`` )

            Correlation: The correlation coefficient between columns of the ``Par1`` input matrix. ``Par1`` of
            size m runs (rows) by n data (columns) is first processed to produce a row vector containing the
            mean of each column, which is then transposed to the output column vector ``Par2`` of n array
            elements. The ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` operation then produces ``ParR``, a resulting n x n matrix of
            correlation coefficients (with a value of 1.0 for the diagonal terms).

          * ``SOLV`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, SOLV, ``Par2`` )

            Solution of simultaneous equations: Solves the set of ``n`` equations of ``n`` terms of the form
            a:sub:`n1` x:sub:`1` + a:sub:`n2` x:sub:`2` + :sup:`...` + a:sub:`nn` x:sub:`n` = b:sub:`n` where
            ``Par1`` contains the matrix of a-coefficients, ``Par2`` contains the vector(s) of b-values, and
            ``ParR`` contains the vector(s) of x-results. ``Par1`` must be a square matrix. The equations must
            be linear, independent, and well conditioned.

            .. warning::

                Non-independent or ill-conditioned equations can cause erroneous results.

            For large matrices, use the APDL Math operation :ref:`lsfactor` for efficiency (see `APDL Math
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_apdl/apdlmathex.html>`_

          * ``SORT`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, SORT, ``Par2``, ``n1``, ``n2``, ``n3`` )

            Matrix sort: Sorts the columns of matrix ``Par1`` according to sort vector ``Par2`` and places the
            result back into ``Par1``. Rows of ``Par1`` are moved to the corresponding positions indicated by
            the values of ``Par2``. ``Par2`` may be a column of ``Par1`` (in which case it will also be
            reordered). Alternatively, you may specify the column of ``Par1`` to sort using ``n1`` (leaving
            ``Par2`` blank). A secondary sort can be specified by column ``n2``, and a third sort using column
            ``n3``. ``ParR`` is the vector of initial row positions (the permutation vector). Sorting ``Par1``
            according to ``ParR`` should reproduce the initial ordering.

          * ``NNEAR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, NNEAR, ``Toler`` )

            Nearest Node: Finds the nodes nearest to the given set of points in ``Par1``, where ``Par1`` is an n
            x 3 array of coordinate locations. ``ParR`` is a vector of the nearest selected nodes, or 0 if no
            nodes are nearer than ``Toler``. ``Toler`` defaults to 1 and is limited to the maximum model size.

          * ``ENEAR`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, ENEAR, ``Toler`` )

            Nearest Element: Finds the elements nearest to the given set of points in ``Par1``, where ``Par1``
            is an n x 3 array of coordinate locations. ``ParR`` is a vector of the nearest selected elements, or
            0 if no element centroids are nearer than ``Toler``. ``Toler`` defaults to 1 and is limited to the
            maximum model size.

          * ``MAP`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, MAP, ``Par2``, ``Par3``, ``kDim``, ``--``, ``kOut``,
            ``LIMIT`` )

            Maps the results from one set of points to another. For example, you can map pressures from a CFD
            analysis onto your model for a structural analysis.

            ``Par1`` is the Nout x 3 array of points that will be mapped to. ``Par2`` is the Nin x M array that
            contains M values of data to be interpolated at each point and corresponds to the Nin x 3 points in
            ``Par3``. The resulting ``ParR`` is the Nout x M array of mapped data points.

            For each point in the destination mesh, all possible triangles in the source mesh are searched to
            find the best triangle containing each point. It then does a linear interpolation inside this
            triangle. You should carefully specify your interpolation method and search criteria in order to
            provide faster and more accurate results (see ``LIMIT``, below).

            ``kDim`` is the interpolation criteria. If ``kDim`` = 2 or 0, two dimensional interpolation is
            applied (interpolate on a surface). If ``kDim`` = 3, three dimensional interpolation is applied
            (interpolate on a volume).

            ``kOut`` specified how points outside of the domain are handled. If ``kOut`` = 0, use the value(s)
            of the nearest region point for points outside of the region. If ``kOut`` = 1, set results outside
            of the region to zero.

            ``LIMIT`` specifies the number of nearby points considered for interpolation. The default is 20, and
            the minimum is 5. Lower values will reduce processing time; however, some distorted or irregular
            sets of points will require a higher ``LIMIT`` value to encounter three nodes for triangulation.

            Output points are incorrect if they are not within the domain (area or volume) defined by the
            specified input points. Also, calculations for out-of-bound points require much more processing time
            than do points that are within bounds. Results mapping is available from the command line only.

          * ``INTP`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, INTP, ``Par2`` )

            Finds the elements that contain each point in the array of n x 3 points in ``Par1``. ``Par2`` will
            contain the set of element ID numbers and ``ParR`` will contain their n x 3 set of natural element
            coordinates (values between -1 and 1). ``Par1`` must be in global Cartesian coordinates.

          * ``SGET`` - ( :ref:`moper`, ``ParR``, ``Par1``, SGET, ``Par2``, ``Label``, ``Comp`` )

            Gets the nodal solution item corresponding to ``Label`` and ``Comp`` (see the :ref:`plnsol` command)
            and interpolates it to the given element locations. ``Par1`` contains the n x 3 array of natural
            element coordinates (values between -1 and 1) of the n element ID numbers in ``Par2``. ``Par1`` and
            ``Par2`` are usually the output of the :ref:`moper`,,,INTP operation. ``ParR`` contains the n
            interpolated results.

        * ``val1, val2,..., val6 : str`` - Additional input used in the operation. The meanings of ``Val1``
          through ``Val6`` vary depending on the specified matrix operation. See the description of ``Oper``
          for details.

        .. _a-MOPER_notes:

        Each starting array element number must be defined for each array parameter matrix if it does not
        start at the first location. For example, :ref:`moper`,A(2,3),B(1,4),MULT,C(1,5) multiplies
        submatrix B (starting at element (1,4)) by submatrix C (starting at element (1,5)) and puts the
        result in matrix A (starting at element (2,3)).

        The diagonal corner elements for each submatrix must be defined: the upper left corner by the array
        starting element (on this command), the lower right corner by the current values from the
        :ref:`vcol` and :ref:`vlen` commands. The default values are the (1,1) element and the last element
        in the matrix. No operations progress across matrix planes (in the 3rd dimension). Absolute values
        and scale factors may be applied to all parameters ( :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact` ). Results may be
        cumulative ( :ref:`vcum` ). Array elements should not be skipped with the :ref:`vmask` and the
        ``NINC`` value of the :ref:`vlen` specifications. See the :ref:`voper` command for details.

          parameter ParR.

        .. _a-MWRITE_notes:

        Writes a matrix or vector to a specified file in a formatted sequence. You can also use the
        :ref:`vwrite` command to write data to a specified file. Both commands contain format descriptors on
        the line immediately following the command. The format descriptors can be in either FORTRAN or C
        format.

        FORTRAN format descriptors are enclosed in parentheses. They must immediately follow the
        :ref:`mwrite` command on a separate line of the same input file. The word FORMAT should not be
        included. The format must specify the number of fields to be written per line, the field width, the
        placement of the decimal point, etc. There should be one field descriptor for each data item
        written. The write operation uses the available system FORTRAN FORMAT conventions (see your system
        FORTRAN manual). Any standard FORTRAN real format (such as (4F6.0), (E10.3,2X,D8.2), etc.) and
        character format (A) may be used. Integer (I) and list-directed (\2) descriptors may not be used.
        Text may be included in the format as a quoted string. The FORTRAN descriptor must be enclosed in
        parentheses and the format must not exceed 80 characters (including parentheses).

        The "C" format descriptors are used if the first character of the format descriptor line is not a
        left parenthesis. "C" format descriptors may be up to 80 characters long, consisting of text strings
        and predefined "data descriptors" between the strings where numeric or alphanumeric character data
        are to be inserted. The normal descriptors are %I for integer data, %G for double precision data, %C
        for alphanumeric character data, and %/ for a line break. There must be one data descriptor for each
        specified value in the order of the specified values. The enhanced formats described in :ref:`msg`
        can also be used.

        The starting array element number must be defined. Looping continues in the directions indicated by
        the Label argument. The number of loops and loop skipping may also be controlled via :ref:`vlen` and
        :ref:`vmask`, which work in the ``n2`` direction (by row on the output file), and by :ref:`vcol`,
        which works in the ``n1`` direction (by column in the output file). The vector specifications
        :ref:`vabs` and :ref:`vfact` apply to this command, while :ref:`vcum` does not apply to this
        command. See :ref:`voper` for details. If you are in the GUI, the :ref:`mwrite` command must be
        contained in an externally prepared file and read into Mechanical APDL (that is, :ref:`use`,
        :ref:`input`,
        etc.).

        .. _a-VPLOT_notes:

        The column to be graphed and the starting row for each array parameter must be specified as

        to limit or skip data to be graphed. The array parameters specified on the :ref:`starvplot` command
        must be of the same type (type ARRAY or TABLE; ( :ref:`dim` ). Arrays of type TABLE are graphed as
        continuous curves. Arrays of type ARRAY is displayed in bar chart fashion.

        The normal curve labeling scheme for :ref:`starvplot` is to label curve 1 "COL 1", curve 2 "COL 2"
        and so on. You can use the :ref:`gcolumn` command to apply user-specified labels (8 characters
        maximum) to your curves. See `Modifying Curve Labels
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_apdl/Hlp_P_APDL3_11.html#apdlch3figt14lm>`_

        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_apdl/apdlxpl.html>`_ for more
        information on using :ref:`gcolumn`.


        When a graph plot reaches minimum or maximum y-axis limits, the program indicates the condition by
        clipping the graph. The clip appears as a horizontal magenta line. Mechanical APDL calculates y-axis
        limits
        automatically; however, you can modify the (YMIN and YMAX) limits via the :ref:`yrange` command.

        This command is valid in any processor.

          values are as shown in the ``IT1NUM`` columns of the table below. Some ``Item1`` labels do not
          require an ``IT1NUM`` value.

        * ``item2, it2num : str`` - A second set of item labels and numbers to further qualify the item for
          which data is to be stored. Most items do not require this level of information.

        * ``kloop : str`` - Field to be looped on:

          * ``0 or 2`` - Loop on the ``ENTNUM`` field (default).

          * ``3`` - Loop on the ``Item1`` field.

        .. _a-VPUT_notes:

        The :ref:`starvput` command is not supported for PowerGraphics displays. Inconsistent results may be
        obtained if this command is not used in :ref:`graphics`, FULL.

        Plot and print operations entered via the GUI ( Utility Menu> Pltcrtls, Utility Menu> Plot )
        incorporate the :ref:`avprin` command. This means that the principal and equivalent values are
        recalculated. If you use :ref:`starvput` to put data back into the database, issue the plot commands
        from the command line to preserve your data.

        This operation is basically the inverse of the :ref:`starvget` operation. Vector items are put
        directly (without any coordinate system transformation) into the Mechanical APDL database. Items can
        only
        replace existing items of the database and not create new items. Degree of freedom results that are
        replaced in the database are available for all subsequent postprocessing operations. Other results
        are changed temporarily and are available mainly for the immediately following print and display
        operations. The vector specification :ref:`vcum` does not apply to this command. The valid labels
        for the location fields ( ``Entity``, ``ENTNUM``, ``Item1``, and ``IT1NUM`` ) are listed below.
        ``Item2`` and ``IT2NUM`` are not currently used. Not all items from the :ref:`starvget` list are
        allowed on :ref:`starvput`, as putting values into some locations could cause the database to be
        inconsistent.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        * ``ncol1 : str`` - Number of columns to be used for Par1 with **\*M** ``XX``  operations. Defaults
        to whatever is needed to fill the result array.

        * ``ncol2 : str`` - Number of columns to be used for Par2 with **\*M** ``XX``  operations. Defaults
        to whatever is needed to fill the result array.

        .. _a-VCOL_notes:

        Specifies the number of columns to be used in array parameter matrix operations. The size of the
        submatrix used is determined from the upper left starting array element (defined on the operation
        command) to the lower right array element (defined by the number of columns on this command and the
        number of rows on the :ref:`vlen` command).

        The default ``NCOL`` is calculated from the maximum number of columns of the result array (the
        :ref:`dim` column dimension) minus the starting location + 1. For example, :ref:`dim`,R,,1,10 and a
        starting location of R(1,7) gives a default of 4 columns ( starting with R(1,7), R(1,8), R(1,9), and
        R(1,10)). Repeat operations automatically terminate at the last column of the result array. Existing
        values in the rows and columns of the results matrix remain unchanged where not overwritten by the
        requested input or operation values.

        The column control settings are reset to the defaults after each **\*M** ``XX``  operation. Use
        :ref:`vstat` to list settings.

              result, ``ParR``, must also have 3 consecutive columns of data and will contain the corresponding
              transformed coordinate locations.

              columns containing the local coordinate locations (x, y, z or r, θ, z or etc.) of the
              points). Only the starting row index and the column index for the x coordinates are specified, such

            ``CON1`` (which may be any valid coordinate system number, such as 1,2,11,12, etc.). The transformed
            result, ``ParR``, must also have 3 consecutive columns of data and will contain the corresponding
            transformed coordinate locations.

          * ``GLOBAL`` - Transforms specified coordinates of a point to global Cartesian coordinates: points
            to be transformed are specified in array ``Par1`` (having 3 consecutive columns of data, with the
            columns containing the local coordinate locations (x, y, z or r, θ, z or etc.) of the
            points). Only the starting row index and the column index for the x coordinates are specified, such
            as A(1,1). The y and z coordinates (or θ and z, or etc.) of the vector are assumed to begin
            in the corresponding next columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3). Local coordinate locations are assumed
            to be in coordinate system ``CON1`` (which may be any valid coordinate system number, such as
            1,2,11,12, etc.). The transformed result, ``ParR``, must also have 3 consecutive columns of data,
            with the columns containing the global Cartesian x, y, and z coordinate locations, respectively.

        * ``par1 : str`` - Array parameter vector in the operation.

        * ``con1, con2, con3 : str`` - Constants (used only with the PWR, NORM, LOCAL, and GLOBAL
          functions).

        .. _a-VFUN_notes:

        Operates on one input array parameter vector and produces one output array parameter vector
        according to: ``ParR`` = f( ``Par1`` )

        where the functions (f) are described below. Functions are based on the standard FORTRAN definitions
        where possible. Out-of-range function results (or results with exponents whose magnitudes are
        approximately greater than 32 or less than -32) produce a zero value. Input and output for angular
        functions may be radians (default) or degrees ( :ref:`afun` ). ``ParR`` may be the same as ``Par1``.
        Starting array element numbers must be defined for each array parameter vector if it does not start
        at the first location. For example, :ref:`vfun`,A,SQRT,B(5) takes the square root of the fifth
        element of B and stores the result in the first element of A. Operations continue on successive
        array elements ( :ref:`vlen`, :ref:`vmask` ) with the default being all successive elements.
        Absolute values and scale factors may be applied to all parameters ( :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact` ).
        Results may be cumulative ( :ref:`vcum` ). Skipping array elements via :ref:`vmask` or :ref:`vlen`
        for the TANG and NORM functions skips only the writing of the results (skipped array element data
        are used in all calculations). See the :ref:`voper` command for details.

        * ``ninc : str`` - Perform the operation on every ``NINC`` row (defaults to 1).

        .. _a-VLEN_notes:

        Specifies the number of rows to be used in array parameter operations. The size of the submatrix
        used is determined from the upper left starting array element (defined on the operation command) to
        the lower right array element (defined by the number of rows on this command and the number of
        columns on the :ref:`vcol` command). ``NINC`` allows skipping row operations for some operation
        commands. Skipped rows are included in the row count. The starting row number must be defined on the
        operation command for each parameter read and for the result written.

        The default ``NROW`` is calculated from the maximum number of rows of the result array (the
        :ref:`dim` row dimension) minus the starting location + 1. For example, :ref:`dim`,R,,10 and a
        starting location of R(7) gives a default of 4 loops (filling R(7), R(8), R(9), and R(10)). Repeat
        operations automatically terminate at the last row of the result array. Existing values in the rows
        and columns of the results matrix remain unchanged where not overwritten by the requested input or
        operation values.

        The stride ( ``NINC`` ) allows operations to be performed at regular intervals. It has no effect on
        the total number of row operations. Skipped operations retain the previous result. For example,
        :ref:`dim`,R,,6, with a starting location of R(1), ``NROW`` = 10, and ``NINC`` = 2 calculates values
        for locations R(1), R(3), and R(5) and retains values for locations R(2), R(4), and R(6). A more
        general skip control may be done by masking ( :ref:`vmask` ). The row control settings are reset to
        the defaults after each **\*V** ``XX``  or **\*M** ``XX``  operation. Use :ref:`vstat` to list
        settings.

        .. _a-VMASK_notes:

        Specifies the name of the parameter whose values are to be checked for each resulting row operation.
        The mask vector usually contains only 0 (for false) and 1 (for true) values. For each row operation
        the corresponding mask vector value is checked. A true value allows the operation to be done. A
        false value skips the operation (and retains the previous results). A mask vector can be created
        from direct input, such as M(1) = 1,0,0,1,1,0,1; or from the DATA function of the :ref:`vfill`
        command. The NOT function of the :ref:`vfun` command can be used to reverse the logical sense of the
        mask vector. The logical compare operations (LT, LE, EQ, NE, GE, and GT) of the :ref:`voper` command
        also produce a mask vector by operating on two other vectors. Any numeric vector can be used as a
        mask vector since the actual interpretation assumes values less than 0.0 are 0.0 (false) and values
        greater than 0.0 are 1.0 (true). If the mask vector is not specified (or has fewer values than the
        result vector), true (1.0) values are assumed for the unspecified values. Another skip control may
        be input with ``NINC`` on the :ref:`vlen` command. If both are present, operations occur only when
        both are true. The mask setting is reset to the default (no mask) after each **\*V** ``XX``  or
        **\*M** ``XX``  operation. Use :ref:`vstat` to list settings.

              1.0 if true, 0.0 if false.

            * ``EQ`` - Equal comparison: ``Par1`` = ``Par2`` gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false.

            * ``DER1`` - First derivative: d( ``Par1`` )/d( ``Par2`` ). The derivative at a point is determined
              over points half way between the previous and next points (by linear interpolation). ``Par1`` must
              be a function (a unique ``Par1`` value for each ``Par2`` value) and ``Par2`` must be in ascending
              order.

            * ``DER2`` - Second derivative: d :sup:`2` ( ``Par1`` )/d( ``Par2`` ) :sup:`2`. See also DER1.

            * ``INT1`` - Single integral:  ``Par1`` d( ``Par2`` ), where ``CON1`` is the integration constant.
              The integral at a point is determined by using the single integration procedure described in the

            * ``INT2`` - Double integral:   ``Par1`` d( ``Par2`` ), where ``CON1`` is the integration constant
              of the first integral and ``CON2`` is the integration constant of the second integral. If ``Par1``
              contains acceleration data, ``CON1`` is the initial velocity and ``CON2`` is the initial
              displacement. See also INT1.

            * ``DOT`` - Dot product: ``Par1``. ``Par2``. ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` must each have three consecutive
              columns of data, with the columns containing the i, j, and k vector components, respectively. Only
              the starting row index and the column index for the i components are specified for ``Par1`` and
              ``Par2``, such as A(1,1). The j and k components of the vector are assumed to begin in the
              corresponding next columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3).

            * ``CROSS`` - Cross product: ``Par1`` x ``Par2``. ``Par1``, ``Par2``, and ``ParR`` must each have 3
              components, respectively. Only the starting row index and the column index for the i components are
              specified for ``Par1``, ``Par2``, and ``ParR``, such as A(1,1). The j and k components of the vector
              are assumed to begin in the corresponding next columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3).

            * ``GATH`` - Gather: For a vector of position numbers, ``Par2``, copy the value of ``Par1`` at each
              position number to ``ParR``. Example: for ``Par1`` = 10,20,30,40 and ``Par2`` = 2,4,1; ``ParR`` =
              20,40,10.

            * ``SCAT`` - Scatter: Opposite of GATH operation. For a vector of position numbers, ``Par2``, copy
              the value of ``Par1`` to that position number in ``ParR``. Example: for ``Par1`` = 10,20,30,40,50
              and ``Par2`` = 2,1,0,5,3; ``ParR`` = 20,10,50,0,40.

            * ``ATN2`` - Arctangent: arctangent of ``Par1`` / ``Par2`` with the sign of each component
              considered.

            * ``LOCAL`` - Transform the data in ``Par1`` from the global Cartesian coordinate system to the
              local coordinate system given in ``CON1``. ``Par1`` must be an N x 3 (that is, vector) or an N x 6
              (that is, stress or strain tensor) array. If the local coordinate system is a cylindrical,
              spherical, or toroidal system, then you must provide the global Cartesian coordinates in ``Par2`` as
              an N x 3 array. Set ``CON2`` = 1 if the data is strain data.

            * ``GLOBAL`` - Transform the data in ``Par1`` from the local coordinate system given in ``CON1`` to
              the global Cartesian coordinate system. ``Par1`` must be an N x 3 (that is, vector) or an N x 6
              (that is, stress or strain tensor) array. If the local coordinate system is a cylindrical,
              spherical, or toroidal system, then you must provide the global Cartesian coordinates in ``Par2`` as
              an N x 3  array. Set ``CON2`` = 1 if the data is strain data.

        par2 : str
            Second array parameter vector in the operation. May also be a scalar parameter or a literal
            constant.

        con1 : str
            First constant (used only with the INT1 and INT2 operations).

        con2 : str
            Second constant (used only with the INT2 operation).

          * ``INT2`` - Double integral:   ``Par1`` d( ``Par2`` ), where ``CON1`` is the integration constant
            of the first integral and ``CON2`` is the integration constant of the second integral. If ``Par1``
            contains acceleration data, ``CON1`` is the initial velocity and ``CON2`` is the initial
            displacement. See also INT1.

          * ``DOT`` - Dot product: ``Par1``. ``Par2``. ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` must each have three consecutive
            columns of data, with the columns containing the i, j, and k vector components, respectively. Only
            the starting row index and the column index for the i components are specified for ``Par1`` and
            ``Par2``, such as A(1,1). The j and k components of the vector are assumed to begin in the
            corresponding next columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3).

          * ``CROSS`` - Cross product: ``Par1`` x ``Par2``. ``Par1``, ``Par2``, and ``ParR`` must each have 3
            components, respectively. Only the starting row index and the column index for the i components are
            specified for ``Par1``, ``Par2``, and ``ParR``, such as A(1,1). The j and k components of the vector
            are assumed to begin in the corresponding next columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3).

          * ``GATH`` - Gather: For a vector of position numbers, ``Par2``, copy the value of ``Par1`` at each
            position number to ``ParR``. Example: for ``Par1`` = 10,20,30,40 and ``Par2`` = 2,4,1; ``ParR`` =
            20,40,10.

          * ``SCAT`` - Scatter: Opposite of GATH operation. For a vector of position numbers, ``Par2``, copy
            the value of ``Par1`` to that position number in ``ParR``. Example: for ``Par1`` = 10,20,30,40,50
            and ``Par2`` = 2,1,0,5,3; ``ParR`` = 20,10,50,0,40.

          * ``ATN2`` - Arctangent: arctangent of ``Par1`` / ``Par2`` with the sign of each component
            considered.

          * ``LOCAL`` - Transform the data in ``Par1`` from the global Cartesian coordinate system to the
            local coordinate system given in ``CON1``. ``Par1`` must be an N x 3 (that is, vector) or an N x 6
            (that is, stress or strain tensor) array. If the local coordinate system is a cylindrical,
            spherical, or toroidal system, then you must provide the global Cartesian coordinates in ``Par2`` as
            an N x 3 array. Set ``CON2`` = 1 if the data is strain data.

          * ``GLOBAL`` - Transform the data in ``Par1`` from the local coordinate system given in ``CON1`` to
            the global Cartesian coordinate system. ``Par1`` must be an N x 3 (that is, vector) or an N x 6
            (that is, stress or strain tensor) array. If the local coordinate system is a cylindrical,
            spherical, or toroidal system, then you must provide the global Cartesian coordinates in ``Par2`` as
            an N x 3  array. Set ``CON2`` = 1 if the data is strain data.

        * ``par2 : str`` - Second array parameter vector in the operation. May also be a scalar parameter or
          a literal constant.

        * ``con1 : str`` - First constant (used only with the INT1 and INT2 operations).

        * ``con2 : str`` - Second constant (used only with the INT2 operation).

        .. _a-VOPER_notes:

        Operates on two input array parameter vectors and produces one output array parameter vector
        according to: ``ParR`` = ``Par1`` o ``Par2``

         where the operations (o) are described below. ``ParR`` can be the same as ``Par1`` or ``Par2``.

        Absolute values and scale factors can be applied to all parameters ( :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact` ).
        Results can be cumulative ( :ref:`vcum` ).

        Starting array element numbers must be defined for each array parameter vector if it does not start
        at the first location, such as :ref:`voper`,A,B(5),ADD,C(3) which adds the third element of C to the
        fifth element of B and stores the result in the first element of A.

        Operations continue on successive array elements ( :ref:`vlen`, :ref:`vmask` ) with the default
        being all successive elements.

        Skipping array elements via :ref:`vmask` or :ref:`vlen` for the DER and INT functions skips only
        the writing of the results (skipped array element data are used in all calculations).

        Parameter functions and operations are available to operate on a scalar parameter or a single
        element of an array parameter, such as SQRT(B) or SQRT(A(4)). (See :ref:`starset` for more
        information.)

        Operations on a sequence of array elements can be performed by repeating the desired function or
        operation in a do-loop ( ``*DO`` ). The vector operations within Mechanical APDLm ( **\*V** ``XX``
        commands) are internally programmed do-loops that conveniently perform the indicated operation over
        a sequence of array elements. If the array is multidimensional, only the first subscript is
        incremented in the do-loop; that is, the operation repeats in column vector fashion down the array.
        For example, for A(1,5), A(2,5), A(3,5), etc. The starting location of the row index must be defined
        for each parameter read and for the result written.

        The default number of loops is from the starting result location to the last result location and can
        be altered via :ref:`vlen`.

        A logical mask vector can be defined to control at which locations the operations are to be skipped
        ( :ref:`vmask` ). The default is to skip no locations.

        Repeat operations automatically terminate at the last array element of the result array column if
        the number of loops is undefined or if it exceeds the last result array element.

        Zeroes are used in operations for values read beyond the last array element of an input array
        column. Existing values in the rows and columns of the results matrix remain unchanged where not
        changed by the requested operation values.

        The result array column may be the same as the input array column, as results in progress are stored
        in a temporary array until being moved to the results array at the end of the operation. Results may
        be overwritten or accumulated with the existing results ( :ref:`vcum` ). The default is to overwrite
        results.

        The absolute value can be used for each parameter read or written ( :ref:`vabs` ). A scale factor
        (defaulting to 1.0) is also applied to each parameter read and written ( :ref:`vfact` ).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        or constants. You must evaluate expressions and functions in the data item fields before using the
        :ref:`vwrite` command, since initially they will be evaluated to a constant and remain constant
        throughout the operation. Unless a file is defined with the :ref:`cfopen` command, data is written
        to the standard output file. Data written to the standard output file may be diverted to a different
        file by first switching the current output file with the :ref:`output` command. You can also use the
        :ref:`mwrite` command to write data to a specified file. Both commands contain format descriptors on
        the line immediately following the command. The format descriptors can be in either FORTRAN or C
        format.

        You must enclose FORTRAN format descriptors in parentheses. They must immediately follow the
        :ref:`vwrite` command on a separate line of the same input file. Do not include the word FORMAT. The
        format must specify the number of fields to be written per line, the field width, the placement of
        the decimal point, etc. You should use one field descriptor for each data item written. The write
        operation uses your system's available FORTRAN FORMAT conventions (see your system FORTRAN manual).
        You can use any standard FORTRAN real format (such as (4F6.0), (E10.3,2X,D8.2), etc.) and
        alphanumeric format (A). Alphanumeric strings are limited to a maximum of 8 characters for any field
        (A8) using the FORTRAN format. Use the "C" format for string arrays larger than 8 characters.
        Integer (I) and list-directed (\2) descriptors may not be used. You can include text in the format as
        a quoted string. The parentheses must be included in the format and the format must not exceed 80
        characters (including parentheses). The output line length is limited to 128 characters.

        The "C" format descriptors are used if the first character of the format descriptor line is not a
        left parenthesis. "C" format descriptors are up to 80 characters long, consisting of text strings
        and predefined "data descriptors" between the strings where numeric or alphanumeric character data
        will be inserted. The normal descriptors are %I for integer data, %G for double precision data, %C
        for alphanumeric character data, and %/ for a line break. There must be one data descriptor for each
        specified value (8 maximum) in the order of the specified values. The enhanced formats described in
        :ref:`msg` may also be used.

        For array parameter items, you must define the starting array element number. Looping continues
        (incrementing the vector index number of each array parameter by one) each time you output a line,
        until the maximum array vector element is written. For example, :ref:`vwrite`,A(1) followed by
        (F6.0) will write one value per output line, that is, A(1), A(2), A(3), A(4), etc. You write
        constants and scalar parameters with the same values for each loop. You can also control the number
        of loops and loop skipping with the :ref:`vlen` and :ref:`vmask` commands. The vector specifications
        :ref:`vabs`, :ref:`vfact`, and :ref:`vcum` do not apply to this command. If looping continues beyond
        the supplied data array's length, zeros will be output for numeric array parameters and blanks for
        character array parameters. For multi-dimensioned array parameters, only the first (row) subscript
        is incremented. See the :ref:`voper` command for details. If you are in the GUI, the :ref:`vwrite`
        command must be contained in an externally prepared file and read into Mechanical APDL (that is,
        :ref:`use`, :ref:`input`, etc.).

        If ``Par`` is a table array name, the subscripts refer to the index numbers of the table and not the
        index values of its primary variables. See :ref:`starset` if you want to evaluate a table array at
        certain values of its primary variables for writing.

        This command is valid in any processor.
