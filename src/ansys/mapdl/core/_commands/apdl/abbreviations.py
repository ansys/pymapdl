        Mechanical APDL Command: `\*ABBR <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ABBR.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        abbr : str
            The abbreviation (up to 8 alphanumeric characters) used to represent the string ``String``. If
            ``Abbr`` is the same as an existing Mechanical APDL command, the abbreviation overrides. Avoid
            using an ``Abbr`` which is the same as an Mechanical APDL command.

        string : str
            String of characters (60 maximum) represented by ``Abbr``. Cannot include a $ or any of the
            commands ``C***``, :ref:`com`, :ref:`gopr`, :ref:`nopr`, :ref:`quit`, :ref:`ui`, or :ref:`end`.
            Parameter names and commands of the ``*DO`` and Use the ``*IF`` groups may not be abbreviated.
            If ``String`` is blank, the abbreviation is deleted. To abbreviate multiple commands, create an
            "unknown command" macro or define ``String`` to execute a macro file ( :ref:`use` ) containing
            the desired commands.

        **Argument Descriptions**

        .. _a-ABBR_argdescript:

        * ``abbr : str`` - The abbreviation (up to 8 alphanumeric characters) used to represent the string
          ``String``. If ``Abbr`` is the same as an existing Mechanical APDL command, the abbreviation overrides.
          Avoid using an ``Abbr`` which is the same as an Mechanical APDL command.

        * ``string : str`` - String of characters (60 maximum) represented by ``Abbr``. Cannot include a $
          or any of the commands ``C***``, :ref:`com`, :ref:`gopr`, :ref:`nopr`, :ref:`quit`, :ref:`ui`, or
          :ref:`end`. Parameter names and commands of the ``*DO`` and Use the ``*IF`` groups may not be
          abbreviated. If ``String`` is blank, the abbreviation is deleted. To abbreviate multiple commands,
          create an "unknown command" macro or define ``String`` to execute a macro file ( :ref:`use` )
          containing the desired commands.

        .. _a-ABBR_notes:

        Once the abbreviation ``Abbr`` is defined, you can issue it at the beginning of a command line and
        follow it with a blank (or with a comma and appended data), and the program will substitute the
        string ``String`` for ``Abbr`` as the line is executed. Up to 100 abbreviations may exist at any
        time and are available throughout the program. Abbreviations may be redefined or deleted at any
        time.

        Use :ref:`starstatus` to display the current list of abbreviations. For abbreviations repeated with
        ``*REPEAT``, substitution occurs before the repeat increments are applied. There are a number of
        abbreviations that are predefined by the program (these can be deleted by using the blank ``String``
        option described above). Note that ``String`` will be written to the :file:`FileLOG`.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the

        ext : str

        * ``cmd : str`` - User-defined command name. Only the first four characters are significant. Must

        .. _s-UCMD_notes:

        Assigns a user-defined command name to a user-programmable (system-dependent) subroutine. This
        feature allows user-defined commands to be programmed into Mechanical APDL. Once programmed, this
        command
        can be input to the program like other commands, and can also be included in the Mechanical APDL
        start-up
        file.

        Up to 10 subroutines are available for user-defined commands (USER01 to USER10). You must have
        system permission, system access, and knowledge to write, compile, and link the appropriate
        subprocessors into Mechanical APDL at your site.

        All routines should be written in FORTRAN. For more information about FORTRAN compilers, refer to
        either the `Ansys, Inc. Windows Installation Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/installation/win_product_table.html>`_ or
        the `Ansys, Inc. Linux Installation Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/installation/lin_product_table.html>`_
         for details specific to your platform or operating
        system.

        The USER01 routine is commented and should be listed from the distribution media (system dependent)
        for more details.

        Issue :ref:`ucmd`,STAT to list all user-defined command names.

        Because a user-programmed command is a nonstandard use of the program, the verification of any
        Mechanical APDL run incorporating these commands is your responsibility. In any contact with
        Mechanical APDL
        customer support regarding the performance of a custom version of Mechanical APDL, explicitly state
        that a
        user-programmable feature has been used.

        See `User-Programmable Features (UPFs)
