        ----------
        base : str
            "Go to" action:

              * ``:, label`` - A user-defined label (beginning with a colon (:), 8 characters maximum). The

              that begins with the matching : ``label``.

              .. warning::     This label option may not be mixed with do-loop or if-then-else constructs.
              * ``STOP`` - This action will cause an exit from the Mechanical APDL program at this line.

        Notes
        -----
        Causes the next read to be from a specified line on the input file. Lines may be skipped or reread.
        The :ref:`stargo` command will not be executed unless it is part of a macro, user file (processed by
        :ref:`use` ), an alternate input file (processed by :ref:`input` ), or unless it is used in a batch-
        mode input stream. Jumping into, out of, or within a do-loop or an if-then-else construct to a :
        ``label`` line is not allowed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        val1 : str
            First numerical value (or parameter which evaluates to numerical value) in the conditional

            strings (enclosed in quotes) or parameters for ``Oper`` = EQ and NE only.

        oper1 : str
            Operation label. A tolerance of 1.0E-10 is used for comparisons between real numbers:

              * ``EQ`` - Equal (for ``VAL1`` = ``VAL2`` ).

              * ``NE`` - Not equal (for ``VAL1`` â‰  ``VAL2`` ).

              * ``LT`` - Less than (for ``VAL1`` < ``VAL2`` ).

              * ``GT`` - Greater than (for ``VAL1`` > ``VAL2`` ).

              * ``LE`` - Less than or equal (for ``VAL1``  :math:``  ``VAL2`` ).

              * ``GE`` - Greater than or equal (for ``VAL1``  :math:``  ``VAL2`` ).

              * ``ABLT`` - Absolute values of ``VAL1`` and ``VAL2`` before < operation.

              * ``ABGT`` - Absolute values of ``VAL1`` and ``VAL2`` before > operation.

        val2 : str
            Second numerical value (or parameter which evaluates to numerical value) in the conditional
            comparison operation.

        conj : str
            (Optional) Connection between two logical clauses.

              * ``AND -`` - True if both clauses ( ``Oper1`` and ``Oper2`` ) are true.

              * ``OR -`` - True if either clause is true.

              * ``XOR -`` - True if either (but not both) clause is true.

        val3 : str
            (Optional) Third numerical value (or parameter which evaluates to numerical value).

        oper2 : str
            (Optional) Operation label. This will have the same labels as ``Oper1``, except it uses
            ``Val3`` and ``Val4``. A tolerance of 1.0E-10 is used for comparisons between real numbers.

        Notes
        -----
        :ref:`repeat` must immediately follow the command that is to be repeated. The numeric arguments of
        the initial command may be incremented in the generated commands. The numeric increment values may
        be integer or real, positive or negative, zero or blank. Alphanumeric arguments cannot be
        incremented. For large values of ``NTOT``, consider printout suppression ( :ref:`nopr` command)
        first.

        Most commands beginning with slash (/), star (\2), as well as "unknown command" macros, cannot be
        repeated. For these commands, or if more than one command is to be repeated, include them within a
        do-loop. File switching commands (those reading additional commands) cannot be repeated. If a
        :ref:`repeat` command immediately follows another :ref:`repeat` command, the repeat action only
        applies to the last non- :ref:`repeat` command. Also, :ref:`repeat` should not be used in
        interactive mode immediately after a) a command (or its log file equivalent) that uses picking, or
        b) a command that requires a response from the user.

        Notes
        -----

        par : str
            The name of the scalar parameter to be used as the loop index. See :ref:`starset` for name
            restrictions. Any existing parameter of the same name will be redefined. There is no character

        ival : str
            Initially assign ``IVAL`` to ``Par``. Increment ``IVAL`` by ``INC`` for each successive loop.
            If ``IVAL`` exceeds ``FVAL`` and ``INC`` is positive, the loop is not executed. ``INC`` defaults
            to 1. Negative increments and non-integer numbers are allowed.

        fval : str
            Initially assign ``IVAL`` to ``Par``. Increment ``IVAL`` by ``INC`` for each successive loop.
            If ``IVAL`` exceeds ``FVAL`` and ``INC`` is positive, the loop is not executed. ``INC`` defaults
            to 1. Negative increments and non-integer numbers are allowed.

        inc : str
            Initially assign ``IVAL`` to ``Par``. Increment ``IVAL`` by ``INC`` for each successive loop.
            If ``IVAL`` exceeds ``FVAL`` and ``INC`` is positive, the loop is not executed. ``INC`` defaults
            to 1. Negative increments and non-integer numbers are allowed.

        Do-loops that include :ref:`input`, :ref:`use`, or an "Unknown Command" macro, have less nesting
