        .. _s-WAIT_notes:

        The command following the :ref:`wait` will not be processed until the specified wait time increment
        has elapsed. Useful when reading from a prepared input file to cause a pause, for example, after a
        display command so that the display can be reviewed for a period of time. Another "wait" feature is
        available via the ``*ASK`` command.

        This command is valid in any processor.
