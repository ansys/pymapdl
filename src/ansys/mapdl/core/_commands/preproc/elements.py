        APDL Command: AFSURF

        This assigns extra nodes to the closest fluid element node.

        This command macro is used to generate surface effect elements overlaid
        on the surface of existing  solid elements and, based on proximity, to
        determine and assign the extra node for each surface element.  The
        underlying volumes of the solid region and the fluid lines must be
        meshed prior to calling this command macro. The active element type
        must be SURF152 with appropriate settings for KEYOPT(4), KEYOPT(5),
        KEYOPT(6), and KEYOPT(8).

        The surface areas of the solid and the target lines of the fluid are
        grouped into components and named using the CM command.  The names must
        be enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'SAREA') when the AFSURF command is
        manually typed in.

        When using the GUI method, node and element components are created
        through the picking dialog boxes associated with this command.

        The macro is applicable for the SURF152 and FLUID116 element types.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sarea
            Component name for the surface areas of the meshed solid volumes.

        tline
            Component name for the target lines meshed with fluid elements.

        APDL Command: E

        Defines an element by its nodes and attribute values. Up to 8
        nodes may be specified with the :meth:`e` command.  If more nodes
        are needed for the element, use the :meth:`emore` command. The
        number of nodes required and the order in which they should be
        specified are described in Chapter 4 of the Element Reference for
        each element type.  Elements are automatically assigned a number
        [NUMSTR] as generated. The current (or default) MAT, TYPE, REAL,
        SECNUM and ESYS attribute values are also assigned to the element.

        When creating elements with more than 8 nodes using this command
        and the EMORE command, it may be necessary to turn off shape
        checking using the SHPP command before issuing this command. If a
        valid element type can be created without using the additional
        nodes on the :meth:`emore` command, this command will create that
        element. The :meth:`emore` command will then modify the element to
        include the additional nodes. If shape checking is active, it will
        be performed before the :meth:`emore` command is issued.
        Therefore, if the shape checking limits are exceeded, element
        creation may fail before the :meth:`emore` command modifies the
        element into an acceptable shape.

        Parameters
        ----------
        i
            Number of node assigned to first nodal position (node
            ``i``).

        j, k, l, m, n, o, p
            Number assigned to second (node ``j``) through eighth
            (node ``p``) nodal position, if any.

        APDL Command: EEXTRUDE

        Parameters
        ----------
        action
            Specifies one of the following command behaviors:

            AUTO - Extrudes plane elements (PLANE182 and PLANE183)
                   based on the KEYOPT(3) setting.  Complementary
                   elements are also extruded. (See Notes for more
                   information.) This behavior is the default.

            PLANE - Extrudes elements in the global Z
                    direction. KEYOPT(3) of the parent elements is
                    ignored.

            AXIS - Extrudes elements about the global Y
                   axis. KEYOPT(3) of the parent elements is ignored.

            TANGENT - Similar to Action = AXIS, except that target
                      elements are extruded in the global Z direction.

        nelem
            Number of elements to generate in the extruded direction. If you do
            not specify a number, the program calculates a number automatically
            based on the average element size and extrusion distance.

        space
            Spacing ratio. If positive, this value is the nominal
            ratio of the last division size to the first division size
            (if > 1.0, sizes increase, if < 1.0, sizes decrease). If
            negative, ``|SPACE|`` is the nominal ratio of the center
            division size to the end division size.  The default value
            is 1.0 (uniform spacing).

        dist
            Distance to extrude in the global Z direction for the plane strain
            case (Action = PLANE). The default is 1.

        theta
            Ending angle (in degrees) to extrude about the global Y axis for
            the axisymmetric case (Action = AXIS). The beginning angle is
            always 0 degrees. The ending angle defaults to 360 degrees.

        tfact
            Factor for increasing the rigid target size. The size of the
            extruded rigid target elements is determined automatically based on
            the size of the contact elements. The default value is 0.2.

        bckey
            Controls the nodal orientation in the third direction and
            boundary-condition mapping (Action = AXIS or TIRE only)

            * 0 : All nodes are rotated to a local Cartesian
                coordinate system where X is the radial, Y axial and Z
                circumferential direction. All loads and displacements
                are mapped from the 2-D model to the 3-D model in the
                local coordinate system.

                If applying rotation ROTY in axisymmetric cases with
                torsion on the 2-D model, this value sets UZ = 0 at
                all corresponding 3-D nodes.  This value is the
                default

            * 1 : Only nodes with applied loads and/or displacements
                are rotated to a local Cartesian co- ordinate system
                where X is the radial, Y axial and Z circumferential
                direction. All loads are mapped to the 3-D model and
                all applied displacements are reset to zero.

        Notes
        -----
        The EEXTRUDE command extrudes current-technology elements PLANE182 and
        PLANE183. Complementary elements TARGE169, CONTA171, CONTA172, and
        REINF263 will also extrude. Extrusion operates automatically on
        elements in the selected element set.

        For automatic PLANE182 and PLANE183 extrusion (Action = AUTO), based on
        the element behavior of the plane elements, the command performs as
        follows:

        Plane stress; the element is ignored.

        Axisymmetric; the element is extruded 360 degrees about the Y-axis.
        THETA is ignored.

        Plane strain (Z strain = 0.0); the element is extruded a unit distance
        in the global Z direction.

        Plane stress with thickness input; the element is extruded in the
        Z-direction as specified by the thickness input via a real constant.

        Generalized plane strain; the element is ignored.

        For an axisymmetric extrusion (Action = AUTO with KEYOPT(3) = 1, Action
        = AXIS, or Action = TANGENT), the command merges any nodes within the
        specified tolerance (SELTOL,TOLER) of the axis into a single node, then
        forms degenerate tetrahedrons, pyramids, or wedges. The default
        tolerance value is 1.0E-6.

        When issuing the EEXTRUDE command within the MAP2DTO3D environment
        using KEYOPT(3) = 3, mapping results do not provide the correct 3-D
        results state; therefore, KEYOPT(3) = 3 is suggested only as a tool for
        extruding the mesh itself as a geometric feature.

        For an axisymmetric extrusion, SHELL208 and SHELL209 will extrude.

        You can control shape-checking options via the SHPP command.

        The extrusion behavior of accompanying contact (CONTA171 and CONTA172)
        is determined by the plane element settings. Rigid target (TARGE169)
        elements are extruded in the global Z direction unless axisymmetric
        extrusion (Action = AXIS) is in effect.

        The following table shows each 2-D element capable of extrusion and its
        corresponding post-extrusion 3-D element:

        All element properties are also transferred consistently during
        extrusion. For example, a  2-D element is extruded to a  3-D element,
        and a mixed u-P 2-D element is extruded to a mixed u-P 3-D element.

        Notes
        -----
        The EINFIN command generates structural infinite elements
        (INFIN257) directly from the selected face of valid base
        elements (existing standard elements in your model). The
        command scans all base elements for the selected nodes and
        generates a compatible infinite element type for each base
        element. A combination of different base element types is
        allowed if the types are all compatible with the infinite
        elements.

        The infinite element type requires no predefinition (ET).

        The faces of base elements are determined from the selected
        node set (NSEL), and the geometry of the infinite element is
        determined based on the shape of the face. Element
        characteristics and options are determined according to the
        base element. For the face to be used, all nodes on the face
        of a base element must be selected

        Use base elements to model the near-field domain that
        interacts with the solid structures or applied loads. To
        apply the truncated far-field effect, a single layer of
        infinite elements must be attached to the near-field domain.
        The outer surface of the near-field domain
        must be convex.

        After the EINFIN command executes, you can verify the newly
        created infinite element types and elements (ETLIST, ELIST,
        EPLOT).

        Infinite elements do not account for any subsequent
        modifications made to the base elements. It is good practice
        to issue the EINFIN
        command only after the base elements are finalized. If you
        delete or modify base elements, remove all affected infinite
        elements and reissue the EINFIN command; doing so prevents
        inconsistencies.

            differences for node orientations). Defaults to 0.0001.
            Only nodes within the tolerance are considered to be
            coincident.

        k
            Only used when the type of the elements to be generated is
            PRETS179. K is the pretension node that is common to the
            pretension section that is being created. If K is not
            specified, it will be created by ANSYS automatically and
            will have an ANSYS-assigned node number. If K is
            specified but does not already exist, it will be
            created automatically but will have the user-specified
            node number. K cannot be connected to any existing element.

        tlab
            Nodal number ordering. Allowable values are:

            LOW - The 2-node elements are generated from the lowest
                  numbered node to the highest numbered node.

            HIGH - The 2-node elements are generated from the highest
                   numbered node to the lowest numbered node.

            REVE - Reverses the orientation of the selected 2-node
                   element.

        kcn
            In coordinate system KCN, elements are created between
            node 1 and node 2 (= node 1 + dx dy dz).

        dx, dy, dz
            Node location increments that define the node offset in
            the active coordinate system (DR, Dθ, DZ for cylindrical
            and DR, Dθ, DΦ for spherical or toroidal).

        knonrot
            When KNONROT = 0, the nodes coordinate system is not
            rotated. When KNONROT = 1, the nodes belonging to the
            elements created are rotated into coordinate system KCN
            (see NROTAT command description).

        Notes
        -----
        Defines 2-node elements (such as gap elements) between
        coincident or offset nodes (within a tolerance). May be used,
        for example, to "hook" together elements interfacing at a
        seam, where the seam consists of a series of node pairs. One
        element is generated for each set of two coincident nodes.
        For more than two coincident or offset nodes in a cluster,
        an element is generated from the lowest numbered
        node to each of the other nodes in the cluster. If fewer than
        all nodes are to be checked for coincidence, use the NSEL
        command to select the nodes. Element numbers are incremented
        by one from the highest previous element number. The element
        type must be set [ET] to a 2-node element before issuing this
        command. Use the CPINTF command to connect nodes by
        coupling instead of by elements. Use the CEINTF command to
        connect the nodes by constraint equations instead of by
        elements.

        For contact element CONTA178, the tolerance is based on the
        maximum Cartesian coordinate difference for node locations
        only. The angle differences for node orientations are not
        checked.

            EITHER - Add (or remove) midside nodes only to (from) element edges which have either

            BOTH - Add (or remove) midside nodes only to (from) element edges which have both
                   corner nodes selected.

        Notes
        -----
        This command adds midside nodes to (or removes midside nodes from) the
        selected elements. For this to occur, the selected elements must be
        midside node capable, the active element type [TYPE] must allow midside
        node capability, and the relationship between the finite element model
        and the solid model (if any) must first be disassociated [MODMSH].

        By default, EMID generates a midside node wherever a zero (or missing)
        midside node occurs for that element. You can control this and add (or
        remove) midside nodes selectively by using the Edges argument. Nodes
        are located midway between the two appropriate corner nodes based on a
        linear Cartesian interpolation. Nodal coordinate system rotation angles
        are also linearly interpolated. Connected elements share the same
        midside node. Node numbers are generated sequentially from the maximum
        node number.

        The EMID command is useful for transforming linear element types to
        quadratic element types having the same corner node connectivity.

        EMID is also useful for transforming elements created outside of the

            Component name of the surface nodes of a structure which attach to

            quotes in the EMTGEN command line.

        ecomp

            Defaults to EMTELM.

        pncomp
            Component name of the plane nodes generated by the command at an
            offset (GAP) from the surface nodes. You must enclose name-strings
            in single quotes in the EMTGEN command line. Defaults to EMTPNO.

        dof
            Active structural degree of freedom (DOF) for TRANS126 elements
            (UX, UY, or UZ) in the Cartesian coordinate system. You must
            enclose the DOF in single quotes.

        gap
            Initial gap distance from the surface nodes to the plane. Be sure
            to use the correct sign with respect to Ncomp node location.

        gapmin
            Minimum gap distance allowed (GAPMIN real constant) for TRANS126
            elements. Defaults to the absolute value of (GAP)*0.05.

        fkn
            Contact stiffness factor used as a multiplier for a contact
            stiffness appropriate for bulk deformation. Defaults to 0.1.

        epzero
            Free-space permittivity. Defaults to 8.854e-6 (μMKS units).

        Notes
        -----
        The EMTGEN command generates a set of TRANS126 elements between the
        surface nodes of a moveable structure and a plane of nodes, typically
        representing a ground plane. The plane of nodes are created by the
        command at a specified offset (GAP). Each element attaches to a surface
        node and to a corresponding node representing the plane. The created
        elements are set to the augmented stiffness method (KEYOPT(6) = 1),
        which can help convergence. The generated plane nodes should be
        constrained appropriately for the analysis.

        You can use TRANS126 elements for simulating fully coupled
        electrostatic structural coupling between a MEMS device and a plane, if
        the gap distance between the device and the plane is small compared to
        the overall surface area dimensions of the device. This assumption
        allows for a point-wise closed-form solution of capacitance between the
        surface nodes and the plane; i.e. CAP = ``EPZERO*AREA/GAP``, where EPZERO
        if the free-space permittivity, AREA is the area associated with the
        node, and GAP is the gap between the node and the plane. The area for
        each node is computed using the ARNODE function in ANSYS. See the ``*GET``
        command description for more information on the ARNODE function.

        With a distributed set of TRANS126 elements attached directly to the
        structure and a plane (such as a ground plane), you can perform a full
        range of coupled electrostatic-structural simulations, including:

        Static analysis (due to a DC voltage or a mechanical load)

        Prestressed modal analysis (eigenfrequencies, including frequency-shift
        effects of a DC bias voltage)

        Prestressed harmonic analysis (system response to a small-signal AC
        excitation with a DC bias voltage or mechanical load)

        Large signal transient analysis (time-transient solution due to an
        arbitrary time-varying voltage or mechanical excitation)

        The TRANS126 element also employs a node-to-node gap feature so you can
        perform contact-type simulations where the structure contacts a plane
        (such as a ground plane). The contact stiffness factor, FKN, is used to
        control contact penetration once contact is initiated. A smaller value
        provides for easier convergence, but with more penetration.

        to the E command except it allows the element number (IEL) to be defined
        explicitly. Element numbers need not be consecutive. Any
        existing element already having this number will be redefined.

        Up to 8 nodes may be specified with the EN command. If more
        nodes are needed for the element, use the
        :meth:`emore` command. The number of nodes required and the
        order in which they should be specified are described in the
        Element Reference for each element type.  The current (or
        default) MAT, TYPE, REAL, SECNUM, and ESYS attribute values
        are also assigned to the element.

        When creating elements with more than 8 nodes using this
        command and the :meth:`emore` command, it may be necessary to
        turn off shape checking using the SHPP command before
        issuing this command. If a valid element type can be created
        without using the additional nodes on the :meth:`emore`
        command, this command will create that element. The
        :meth:`emore` command will then modify the element to include
        the additional nodes. If shape checking is active, it will be
        performed before the :meth:`emore` command is issued.
        Therefore, if the shape checking limits are exceeded, element
        creation may fail before the :meth:`emore` command modifies
        the element into an acceptable shape.

        This command specifies end releases for the BEAM188, BEAM189, PIPE288,
        and PIPE289 elements. The command works on currently selected nodes and
        elements. It creates end releases on any two connected beam elements
        whose angle at connection exceeds the specified tolerance. From within
        the GUI, the Picked node option generates an end release at the
        selected node regardless of the angle of connection (angle tolerance is
        set to -1).

        APDL Command: ENORM

        Parameters
        ----------
        enum
            Element number having the normal direction that the
            reoriented elements are to match.

        Notes
        -----
        Reorients shell elements so that their outward normals are
        consistent with that of a specified element. ENORM can also be
        used to reorder nodal connectivity of line elements so that
        their nodal ordering is consistent with that of a specified
        element.

        For shell elements, the operation reorients the element by
        reversing and shifting the node connectivity pattern. For
        example, for a 4-node shell element, the nodes in positions I,
        J, K and L of the original element are placed in positions J,
        I, L and K of the reoriented element. All 3-D shell elements
        in the selected set are considered for reorientation, and no
        element is reoriented more than once during the
        operation. Only shell elements adjacent to the lateral (side)
        faces are considered.

        The command reorients the shell element normals on the same
        panel as the specified shell element. A panel is the geometry
        defined by a subset of shell elements bounded by free edges or
        T-junctions (anywhere three or more shell edges share common
        nodes).

        Reorientation progresses within the selected set until either
        of the following conditions is true:

        - The edge of the model is reached.

        - More than two elements (whether selected or unselected) are
          adjacent to a lateral face.

        In situations where unselected elements might undesirably
        cause case b to control, consider using ENSYM,0,,0,ALL instead
        of ENORM.  It is recommended that reoriented elements be
        displayed and graphically reviewed.

        You cannot use the ENORM command to change the normal
        direction of any element that has a body or surface load. We
        recommend that you apply all of your loads only after ensuring
        that the element normal directions are acceptable.

        Real constant values are not reoriented and may be invalidated
        by an element reversal.

        Notes
        -----
        This command is the same as the ESYM command except it allows
        explicitly assigning element numbers to the generated set (in
        terms of an increment IINC). Any existing elements already
        having these numbers will be redefined.

        The operation generates a new element by incrementing the
        nodes on the original element, and reversing and shifting the
        node connectivity pattern.  For example, for a 4-node 2-D
        element, the nodes in positions I, J, K and L of the original
        element are placed in positions J, I, L and K of the reflected
        element.

        Similar permutations occur for all other element types. For
        line elements, the nodes in positions I and J of the original
        element are placed in positions J and I of the reflected
        element. In releases prior to ANSYS 5.5, no node pattern
        reversing and shifting occurred for line elements generated by
        ENSYM. To achieve the same results as you did in releases
        prior to ANSYS 5.5, use the ENGEN command instead.

        See the ESYM command for additional information about symmetry
        elements.

        The ENSYM command also provides a convenient way to reverse
        shell element normals. If the IINC and NINC argument fields
        are left blank, the effect of the reflection is to reverse the
        direction of the outward normal of the specified elements. You
        cannot use the ENSYM command to change the normal direction of
        any element that has a body or surface load. We recommend that
        you apply all of your loads only after ensuring that the
        element normal directions are acceptable. Also note that real
        constants (such as nonuniform shell thickness and tapered beam
        constants) may be invalidated by an element reversal. See
        Revising Your Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for more

        The EREINF command generates reinforcing elements (REINF264 and

        Although predefining the reinforcing element type (ET) is not
        required, you must define the reinforcing element section type
        (SECTYPE); otherwise, ANSYS cannot generate the
        reinforcing element.

        The EREINF command does not create new nodes. The reinforcing

            Generates target, contact, and hydrostatic fluid elements
            with correct direction of normals.

            TOP - Generates target and contact elements over beam and

                  shell elements, with the normals the same as the
                  underlying beam and shell elements (default).

            BOTTOM - Generates target and contact elements over beam
                     and shell elements, or hydrostatic fluid
                     elements over shell elements, with the
                     normals opposite to the underlying beam and shell
                     elements.

            If target or contact elements and hydrostatic fluid

            elements, you only need to use this option once to orient
            the normals opposite to the
            underlying shell elements.

                      existing selected target elements, contact
                      elements, and hydrostatic fluid elements. - If
                      target or contact elements and hydrostatic
                      fluid elements are defined on the same
                      underlying shell elements, you only need to use
                      this option once to reverse the normals for all
                      selected elements.

        shape
            Used to specify the element shape for target element
            TARGE170 (Shape = LINE or POINT) or TARGE169 elements
            (Shape = POINT).

            (blank) - The target element takes the same shape as the
                      external surface of the underlying element
                      (default).

            LINE - Generates LINE or PARA (parabolic) segments on
                   exterior of selected 3-D elements.

            POINT - Generates POINT segments on selected nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        The ESURF command generates elements of the currently active
        element type overlaid on the free faces of existing elements.
        For example, surface elements (such as SURF151, SURF152,
        SURF153, SURF154, or SURF159) can be generated over solid
        elements (such as PLANE55, SOLID70, PLANE182, SOLID185,
        or SOLID272, respectively).

        Element faces are determined from the selected node set
        (NSEL) and the load faces for that element type. The
        operation is similar to that used for generating element
        loads from selected nodes via the SF,ALL command, except that
        elements (instead of loads) are generated. All nodes on the
        face must be selected for the face to be used. For shell
        elements, only face one of the element is available. If nodes
        are shared by adjacent selected element faces, the faces are not
        free and no element is generated.

        Elements created by ESURF are oriented such that their
        surface load directions are consistent with those of the
        underlying elements. Carefully check generated elements and
        their orientations.

        Generated elements use the existing nodes and the active MAT,
        TYPE, REAL, and ESYS attributes. The exception is when Tlab =
        REVERSE. The reversed target and contact elements have the
        same attributes as the original elements. If the underlying
        elements are solid elements, Tlab = TOP or BOTTOM has no effect.

        When the command generates a target element, the shape is by
        default the same as that of the underlying element. Issue
        ESURF,,, LINE or ESURF,,,POINT to generate LINE, PARA,
        and POINT segments.

        The ESURF command can also generate the 2-D or 3-D
        node-to-surface element CONTA175, based on the selected node
        components of the underlying solid elements. When used to
        generate CONTA175 elements, all ESURF arguments are ignored.
        (If CONTA175 is the active element type, the path Main Menu>
        Preprocessor> Modeling> Create> Elements> Node-to-Surf uses
        ESURF to generate elements.)

        To generate SURF151 or SURF152 elements that have two extra
        nodes from FLUID116 elements, KEYOPT(5) for SURF151 or
        SURF152 is first set to 0 and ESURF is issued. Then KEYOPT(5)
        for SURF151 or SURF152 is set to 2 and MSTOLE is issued. For
        more information, see Using the Surface Effect Elements in
        the Thermal Analysis Guide.

        For hydrostatic fluid elements HSFLD241 and HSFLD242,
        the ESURF command generates triangular (2-D) or
        pyramid-shaped (3-D) elements with bases that are overlaid on
        the faces of selected 2-D or 3-D solid or shell elements.
        The single vertex for all generated elements is at the
        pressure node specified as XNODE. The generated elements fill
        the volume enclosed by the solid or shell elements. The nodes
        on the overlaid faces have translational degrees of freedom,
        while the pressure node shared by all generated elements has
        a single hydrostatic pressure degree of freedom, HDSP (see
        HSFLD241 and HSFLD242 for more information about the pressure
        node).

        iel1, iel2, ieinc
            Reflect elements from pattern beginning with IEL1 to IEL2
            (defaults to IEL1) in steps of IEINC (defaults to 1). If
            IEL1 = ALL, IEL2 and IEINC are ignored and pattern is all
            selected elements [ESEL]. A component name may
            also be substituted for IEL1 (IEL2 and IEINC are ignored).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates additional elements from a given pattern (similar
        to EGEN) except with a "symmetry" reflection. The operation
        generates a new element by incrementing the nodes on the
        original element, and reversing and shifting  the node
        connectivity pattern. For example, for a 4-node 2-D element,
        the nodes in positions I, J, K, and L of the original element
        are placed in positions J, I, L, and K of the reflected element.

        Similar permutations occur for all other element types. For line
        elements, the nodes in positions I and J of the original
        element are placed in positions J and I of the reflected
        element. In releases prior
        to ANSYS 5.5, no node pattern reversing and shifting occurred
        for line elements generated by ESYM. To achieve the same
        results with ANSYS 5.5 as you did in prior releases, use the
        EGEN command instead.

        It is recommended that symmetry elements be displayed and
        graphically reviewed.

        If the nodes are also reflected (as with the NSYM command)
        this pattern is such that the orientation of the symmetry
        element remains similar to the original element (i.e.,
        clockwise elements are generated from
        clockwise elements).

        For a non-reflected node pattern, the reversed orientation
        has the effect of reversing the outward normal direction (
        clockwise elements are generated from counterclockwise
        elements).

        Note:: : Since nodes may be defined anywhere in the model
        independently of this command, any orientation of the
        "symmetry" elements is possible. See also the ENSYM command
        for modifying existing elements.

        APDL Command: GCDEF

        GCDEF defines the interface interaction between general contact
        surfaces identified by SECT1 and SECT2. GCDEF commands are order
        independent in most cases.

        GCDEF definitions should be issued after GCGEN. They are saved in the
        database and are written to and read from .CDB files.

        See General Contact in the Contact Technology Guide for more
        information on the overall procedure to create general contact.

        SECT1/SECT2 Interactions

        The most specific types of general contact definitions are those
        described below:

        The remaining general contact definition types can be overridden by the
        above two general contact definition types:

        Parameters

            Option to be performed.

            (blank) - Retain the previous Option setting between SECT1 and SECT2.

            AUTO - Define auto asymmetric contact between surfaces SECT1 and SECT2.

            SYMM - Define symmetric contact between surfaces SECT1 and SECT2.

            ASYM - Define asymmetric contact with SECT1 as the source
                   (contact) surface and SECT2 as the target surface.

            EXCL - Exclude contact between surfaces SECT1 and
            SECT2. MATID and REALID are ignored.

            DELETE - Remove the given definition from the GCDEF
            table. MATID and REALID are ignored.

            Note that GCDEF,DELETE,ALL,ALL does not remove the entire
            GCDEF table; it merely removes any existing GCDEF,,ALL,ALL
            definitions, while leaving intact any existing GCDEF
            definitions that are more specific.  - To remove the
            entire GCDEF table, issue GCDEF,DELETE,TOTAL.

            It is good practice to list all definitions using
            GCDEF,LIST,ALL,ALL before and after a GCDEF,DELETE
            command.

            LIST - List stored GCDEF data entries. MATID and REALID are
            ignored. GCDEF,LIST,ALL,ALL lists the entire GCDEF table,
            including more specific GCDEF definitions. - TABLE

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Option to be performed.

            NEW - Create a new general contact definition. This option removes all existing
                  general contact elements and generates new elements with new
                  section IDs. Any existing GCDEF specifications, general
                  contact SECTYPE/SECDATA data, and general contact element
                  types are also removed. If no general contact elements or
                  data exist, this option behaves the same as Option = UPDATE.

            UPDATE - Generate general contact elements on newly added (or selected) base elements.
                     Newly generated contact elements are assigned new Section
                     IDs. Existing general contact elements remain with their
                     previously assigned section IDs and element attributes.
                     Existing GCDEF and SECTYPE/SECDATA general contact data
                     are respected. (This is the default option.)

            DELETE - Remove all existing general contact elements. Existing GCDEF specifications,
                     general contact SECTYPE/SECDATA data, and general contact
                     element types are also removed.

            SELECT - Select all existing general contact elements.

        featureangle
            Angle tolerance for determining feature edges (EdgeKEY) and general
            surfaces (SplitKey). Default = 42 degrees.

        edgekey
            Key that controls creation of general contact line elements
            (CONTA177) on base shell element perimeter edges and/or base solid
            element feature edges. See Understanding FeatureANGLE for an
            explanation of the feature edge criteria.

            0 - Exclude feature edges and shell perimeter edges (default).

            1 - Include feature edges only.

            2 - Include shell perimeter edges only.

            3 - Include both feature edges and shell perimeter edges.

        splitkey
            Key that controls how section IDs and contact element type IDs are
            assigned to surfaces.

            SPLIT - Assign a different section ID and contact element type ID for every general
                    surface of the selected base elements (default). See
                    Understanding FeatureANGLE for an explanation of the split
                    criteria. Different section IDs are assigned to top and
                    bottom surfaces of 2-D beam and 3-D shell bodies. This
                    allows different GCDEF specifications for different
                    portions of the assembly.

            PART - Assign a different section ID and contact element type ID for every general
                   surface which covers a physical part. Compared to the SPLIT
                   option, this option produces fewer unique section IDs, which
                   can make it easier to specify interactions via GCDEF.
                   However, it may also result in a less accurate and/or less
                   efficient solution.

        selopt
            Key that controls which base elements are considered for general
            contact.

            ATTACH - Use a recursive adjacency selection to obtain complete physical parts, starting
                     from the selected base elements, before generating general
                     contact elements (default).

            SELECT - Use only the initially selected base elements to generate general contact
                     elements.

        Notes
        -----
        GCGEN creates general contact elements on the exterior faces of
        selected base elements. The base elements can be 2-D or 3-D solids, 2-D
        beams (top and bottom), or 3-D shells (top and bottom). The contact
        element types can be CONTA172, CONTA174, and/or CONTA177, depending
        upon the types of base elements in the model and the specified GCGEN
        options. General contact elements are identified by a real constant ID
        equal to zero.

        You can control contact interactions between specific general contact
        surfaces that could potentially be in contact by using the GCDEF
        command. See General Contact in the Contact Technology Guide for more
        information on the overall procedure to create general contact.

        Understanding FeatureANGLE

        The exterior facets of the selected base solid and shell elements are
        divided into subsets based on the angle between the normals of
        neighboring faces. On a flat or smooth surface, adjacent exterior
        element faces have normals that are parallel or nearly parallel; that
        is, the angle between the adjacent normals is near zero degrees.

        When the angle between the normals of two adjacent faces is greater
        than FeatureANGLE, the two faces are considered to be on two separate
        surfaces (SplitKey = SPLIT). The edge between the faces may be convex
        or concave. A convex (or outside) edge is considered to be a feature
        edge and may be affected by the EdgeKEY setting. For more information,
        see Feature Angle (FeatureANGLE) in the Contact Technology Guide.

        Notes
        -----
        This command macro is used to generate surface effect elements (SURF151
        or SURF152) overlaid on the surface of existing plane or solid elements
        and, based on proximity, to determine and assign the extra node
        (FLUID116) for each surface element. The active element type must be
        SURF151 or SURF152 with appropriate settings for KEYOPT(4), KEYOPT(5),
        KEYOPT(6), and KEYOPT(8).

        The surface nodes of the plane or solid elements must be grouped into a
        node component and the fluid elements must be grouped into an element
        component and named using the CM command.  The names must be enclosed
        in single quotes (e.g., 'NOD') when the NDSURF command is manually
        typed in.

        When using the GUI method, node and element components are created
        through the picking dialog boxes associated with this command.

        The macro is applicable for the SURF151, SURF152, and FLUID116 element
        types.

        -----
        This command updates the geometry of the finite element model according

        nsavevars
            The number of saved variables.

        nrsltvar
            The number of variables saved in results files.

        keyansmat
            Key for element formulation control:

            0 - Create your own material codes within the element formulation. In this case,
                the real constants are available to input material properties.
                You can also input linear material properties via MP and MPDATA

            1 - Use ANSYS standard material routines or the USERMAT subroutine to form
                structural material data. ANSYS material properties must be

        Notes
        -----
        The USRELEM command specifies the characteristics of the user-defined
        element USER300.

        Although you can intersperse other commands as necessary for your
        analysis, issue the USRELEM command as part of the following general
        sequence of commands:

        Issue the ET command for element USER300, followed by the related TYPE
        command.

        Issue both the USRELEM and USRDOF commands (in either order).

        Define your element using USER300.

        The number of real constants (NREAL) can refer to geometry quantities,
        material quantities, or any parameters for element formulation.

        ANSYS saves variables in the .esav file to preserve element data when
        you specify a positive NSAVEVARS value. When KEYANSMAT = 0, all
        variables of both material and kinematic formulation are saved. When
        KEYANSMAT = 1, only the variables for kinematic formulation (such as
        deformation gradient tensor) are saved; in this case, the material
        routine saves all necessary material data automatically.

        Element data saved in results files (NRSLTVAR) are accessible only as
        nonsummable miscellaneous data.  ANSYS saves stress and total strain
        data for structural elements in the .rst file automatically (as it does
        for equivalent variables such as thermal gradient and thermal flux in
        thermal elements); therefore, NRSLTVAR does not need to include stress
        and total strain data.

        iel
            Element number (next available number by default).

        node
            Node number connecting support structure and turbine.

        damp
            Damping option for the turbine:

            0 - Damping matrix obtained from the aeroelastic code plus Rayleigh damping
                (default).

            1 - Rayleigh damping only.

            2 - Damping from the aeroelastic code only.

        Notes
        -----
        WTBCREATE invokes a predefined ANSYS macro that will automatically
        generate a turbine element and issue relevant data commands that are
        necessary to run a full aeroelastic coupling analysis. For detailed
        information on how to perform a fully coupled aeroelastic analysis, see
        Fully Coupled Wind Turbine Example in Mechanical APDL in the Mechanical
        APDL Programmer's Reference.

        The generated USER300 turbine element will have 9 nodes with node
        numbers NODE, NMAX+1, NMAX+2, ..., NMAX+8, where NMAX is the maximum
        node number currently in the model.

        There are 6 freedoms on the first node of the element: UX, UY, UZ,
        ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ, and these are true structural freedoms. For all the
        other nodes (i.e., nodes 2 to 9), only the translational freedoms (UX,
        UY, UZ) are used. These are generalized freedoms that are internal to
        the turbine element and are used by the aeroelastic code only.

        The element type integer of the USER300 element is the current maximum
        element type integer plus one.

        The command will also set up the analysis settings appropriate for a
        full aeroelastic coupling analysis. These include full Newton-Raphson
        solution (NROPT,FULL) and a USRCAL command to activate the relevant
        user routines.
