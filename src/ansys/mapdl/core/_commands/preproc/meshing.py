        Notes
        -----
        Concatenates multiple, adjacent areas (the input areas) into one area
        (the output area) in preparation for mapped meshing.  A volume that
        contains too many areas for mapped meshing can still be mapped meshed
        if some of the areas in that volume are first concatenated (see Meshing
        Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for details on
        mapped meshing restrictions).

        Because of modeling restrictions that result from its use, ACCAT is
        meant to be used solely for meshing.  Specifically, (a) the output area
        and any volumes that have the output area on their area list [VLIST]
        cannot be used as input to any other solid modeling operation (not even
        another ACCAT command); and (b) the output area cannot accept solid
        model boundary conditions [DA, SFA].

        The output area (or volumes which contain it) will be meshed [AMESH,
        VMESH] by meshing the input areas, which themselves must be meshable.
        The output area from the ACCAT operation will be coincident with the
        input areas and the input areas will be retained.  Consider the AADD
        command instead of ACCAT if you wish to delete the input areas.  When
        an ACCAT command is issued, volume area lists [VLIST] that contain all
        of the input areas will be updated so that the volume area lists refer
        to the output area instead of the input area.  Deletion of the output
        area [ADELE] effectively reverses the ACCAT operation and restores
        volume area lists to their original condition.  ACCAT operations on
        pairs of adjacent four-sided areas automatically concatenate
        appropriate lines [LCCAT]; in all other situations, line concatenations
        must be addressed by the user.

        You can use the ASEL command to select areas that were created by
        concatenation, and then follow it with an ADELE,ALL command to delete
        them.  See Meshing Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide
        for a discussion on how to easily select and delete concatenated areas
        in one step.

            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of the number of elements outward
            from the indicated areas (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain

        default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements with
        1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        AREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that

            Tolerance for coincidence (based on maximum coordinate difference
            in each global Cartesian direction for node locations and on angle
            differences for node orientations).  Defaults to 0.0001. Only nodes

        dx, dy, dz

        knonrot
            When KNONROT = 0, the nodes on coupled sets are rotated into
            coordinate system KCN (see NROTAT command description). When

        CZMESH is used on a mesh with shared nodes at the interface.

        If ecomps1 and ecomps2 are specified, the CZMESH command creates/meshes
        interface elements (INTER202, INTER203, INTER204, INTER205) along the
        boundary between the two components or groups of elements.

        The elements in each of the components or groups of elements will share
        nodes with each other and also with the interface elements. This one-
        element thick boundary of interface elements will split the body
        between the two components or groups of elements.

        Subsequent separation (delamination and failure) of the interface zone
        will result in an increasing displacement between the nodes (within the
        interface element) along the cohesive zone elements. Unless otherwise
        specified, the CZMESH command analyzes the configuration and geometry
        of the adjacent structural elements and provides the appropriate
        interface element.

        the split surface of the original mesh from the original nodes to the
        newly created coincident duplicate nodes. However, displacements,

            Defaults to 28 degrees per element.

        edgmn
            Minimum element edge length. Defaults to no minimum edge length.
            The MINL or MINH argument can override this value.

        edgmx
            Maximum element edge length. Defaults to no maximum edge length.
            The MXEL argument can override this value.

        adjf
            Target aspect ratio for adjacent line.  Used only when free
            meshing. Defaults to 1.0, which attempts to create equal-sided
            h-elements.

        adjm
            Target aspect ratio for adjacent line.  Used only when map meshing.
            Defaults to 4.0, which attempts to create rectangular h-elements.

        Notes
        -----
        DESIZE settings are usually used for mapped meshing.  They are also
        used for free meshing if SmartSizing is turned off [SMRTSIZE,OFF],
        which is the default.  Even when SmartSizing is on, some DESIZE
        settings (such as maximum and minimum element edge length) can affect
        free mesh density. The default settings of the DESIZE command  are used
        only when no other element size specifications [KESIZE, LESIZE, ESIZE]
        exist for a certain line.

        This command is also valid for rezoning.

        Parameters
        ----------
        etype
            Specifies which elements to orient.

            LYSL - Specifies that certain solid elements (such as
                   SOLID185 with KEYOPT(3) = 1,
                   SOLID186 with KEYOPT(3) = 1, and SOLSH190) will be
                   oriented. This value is the default.

        dir_
            The axis and direction for orientation, or an element
            number. If Dir is set to a positive number (n),
            then all eligible elements are oriented as similarly as
            possible to element n.

            NEGX - The element face with the outward normal most
                   nearly parallel to the element coordinate system’s
                   negative x-axis is designated (reoriented) as face 1.

            POSX - The element face with the outward normal most
                   nearly parallel to the element coordinate system’s
                   positive x-axis is designated (reoriented) as face 1.

            NEGY - The element face with the outward normal most
                   nearly parallel to the element coordinate system’s
                   negative y-axis is designated (reoriented) as face
                   1. .

            POSY - The element face with the outward normal most
                   nearly parallel to the element coordinate system’s
                   positive y-axis is designated (reoriented) as face 1.

            NEGZ - (Default) The element face with the outward normal
                   most nearly parallel to the element coordinate
                   system’s negative z-axis is designated (reoriented)
                   as face 1.

                   nearly parallel to the element coordinate system’s
                   positive z-axis is designated (reoriented) as face 1.

        toler
            The maximum angle (in degrees) between the outward normal
            face and the target axis. Default is 90.0.
            Lower toler values will reduce the number of faces that
            are considered as the basis of element reorientation.

        Notes
        -----
        EORIENT renumbers the element faces, designating the face  most
        parallel to the XY plane of the element coordinate system (set
        with ESYS) as face 1 (nodes I-J-K-L, parallel to the layers
        in layered elements). It calculates the outward normal of
        each face and changes the node designation  of the elements
        so the face with a normal most nearly parallel with and in
        the same general direction as the target axis becomes face 1.

        The target axis, defined by Dir, is either the negative or
        positive indicated axis or the outward normal of face 1 of
        that element.

        All SOLID185 Layered Structural Solid, SOLID186 Layered
        Structural Solid, and SOLSH190 solid shell elements in the
        selected set are considered for reorientation.

        After reorienting elements, you should always display and
        graphically review results using the /ESHAPE command. When
        plotting models with many or symmetric layers, it may be
        useful to temporarily reduce the number of layers to two,
        with one layer being much thicker than the other.

        You cannot use EORIENT to change the normal direction of any
        element that has a body or surface load.  We recommend that
        you apply all of your loads only after ensuring that the
        element normal directions are acceptable.

        Prisms and tetrahedrals are also supported, within the current
        limitations of the SOLID185, SOLID186, and SOLSH190 elements.
        (Layers parallel to the four-node face of the prism are not
        supported.)

        ne1, ne2, ninc
            Elements (NE1 to NE2 in increments of NINC) around which
            the mesh is to be refined. NE2 defaults to NE1, and NINC
            defaults to 1. If NE1 = ALL, NE2 and NINC are ignored and

            name may also be substituted for NE1 (NE2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done. Specify the value of
            LEVEL as an integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1
            provides minimal refinement, and a value of 5 provides
            maximum refinement (defaults to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of number of elements
            outward from the indicated elements, NE1 to NE2
            (defaults to 0).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element
            splitting, in order to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done. Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done. Existing
                    elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be
            retained in the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.
            (The ANSYS program ignores the RETAIN argument when you
            are refining anything other than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of
                 quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements
                  in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        EREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified
        elements. By default, the surrounding elements are split to
        create new elements with 1/2 the edge length of the original
        elements (LEVEL = 1).

        EREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume
        elements that are adjacent to the specified elements. Any
        volume elements that are adjacent to the specified elements,
        but are not tetrahedra (for example, hexahedra, wedges,
        and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains
        initial conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes
        [CP family of commands], constraint equations [CE family of
        commands], or boundary conditions or loads applied directly
        to any of its nodes or elements. This applies to nodes and
        elements anywhere in the model, not just in the
        region where you want to request mesh refinement. If you have
        detached the mesh from the solid model, you must disable
        postprocessing cleanup or smoothing (POST = OFF) after the
        refinement to preserve the element attributes.

            1 - Keep area elements.

        Notes
        -----
        The FVMESH command generates a tetrahedral volume mesh from a selected
        set of detached exterior area elements (facets).  (Detached elements
        have no solid model associativity.)  The area elements can be
        triangular-shaped, quadrilateral-shaped, or a mixture of the two.

        The FVMESH command is in contrast to the VMESH command, which requires
        a volume to be input.

        The main tetrahedra mesher [MOPT,VMESH,MAIN] is the only tetrahedra
        mesher that supports the FVMESH command.  The alternate tetrahedra
        mesher [MOPT,VMESH,ALTERNATE] does not support FVMESH. MESH200 elements
        do not support FVMESH.

        Tetrahedral mesh expansion [MOPT,TETEXPND,Value] is supported for both
        the FVMESH and VMESH commands.  Tet-mesh expansion is the only mesh
        control supported by FVMESH.

        Triangle- or quadrilateral-shaped elements may be used as input to the
        FVMESH command. Where quadrilaterals are used, the default behavior is
        for the pyramid-shaped elements to be formed at the boundary when the
        appropriate element type is specified. See the MOPT,PYRA command for
        details.

        The FVMESH command does not support multiple "volumes."  If you have
        multiple volumes in your model, select the surface elements for one
        "volume," while making sure that the surface elements for the other
        volumes are deselected.  Then use FVMESH to generate a mesh for the
        first volume.  Continue this procedure by selecting one volume at a
        time and meshing it, until all of the volumes in the model have been
        meshed.

        If an error occurs during the meshing operation, the area elements are

        nsla
            Number that identifies the source line or area. This is the line or
            area whose mesh will provide the pattern for the interface
            elements. ANSYS copies the pattern of the line or area elements
            through the area or volume to create the mesh of area or volume
            interface elements.

        ntla
            Number that identifies the target line or area. This is the line or
            area that is opposite the source line or area specified by NSLA.
            Add NTLA to obtain the copied mesh from the source line or area.

        kcn
            Number that identifies the particular ANSYS coordinate system.

        dx, dy, dz
            Incremental translation of node coordinates in the active
            coordinate system (DR, Dθ, DZ for cylindrical, and DR, Dθ, DΦ for
            spherical or toroidal). The source line or area coordinates + DX,
            DY, DZ = the target line or area coordinates. If left blank, ANSYS
            automatically estimates the incremental translation.

        tol
            Tolerance for verifying topology and geometry. By default, ANSYS
            automatically calculates the tolerance based on associated
            geometries.

        Notes
        -----
        Generates nodes and interface elements along lines or areas. The IMESH
        command requires that the target line or area exactly match the source
        line or area. Also, both target and source lines or areas must be in
        the same area or volume. The area or volume containing the source line
        or area must be meshed before executing IMESH, while the area or volume
        containing the target line or area must be meshed after executing

            Size of elements along lines nearest keypoint NPT (overrides any

            FACT2.

        fact1
            Scale factor applied to a previously defined SIZE.  Not used if

            Scale factor applied to the minimum element division at keypoint
            NPT for any attached line.  This feature is useful with adaptive

        The remaining line divisions are determined from the division nearest
        the keypoint at the other end of the line (specified by another KESIZE

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of the number of elements outward
            from the indicated keypoints (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        KREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified keypoints.
        By default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements
        with 1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        KREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified keypoints.  Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified keypoints, but are not tetrahedra (for
        example, hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements.  This applies

            Material number, real constant set number, and type number

        kb, ke
            Beginning and ending orientation keypoints to be
            associated with selected, unmeshed lines.  ANSYS uses the
            location of these keypoints to determine how to orient
            beam cross sections during beam meshing.  Beam elements

            pre-twisted beam may be created by selecting different
            orientation keypoints at each end of the line (KB and KE).
            (For a line bounded by two keypoints (KP1 and KP2), the
            orientation vector at the beginning of the line extends
            from KP1 to KB, and the orientation vector at the end of
            the line extends from KP2 to KE.  The orientation vectors
            are used to compute the orientation nodes of the
            elements.)

        secnum
            Section identifier to be associated with selected,
            unmeshed lines.  For details, see the description of the
            SECTYPE and SECNUM commands.

        Notes
        -----
        The element attributes specified by the LATT command will be
        used when the lines are meshed.

        Lines subsequently generated from the lines will also have the
        attributes specified by MAT, REAL, TYPE, and SECNUM.  If a
        line does not have these attributes associated with it (by
        this command) at the time it is meshed, the attributes are
        obtained from the then current MAT, REAL, TYPE, and SECNUM
        command settings.

        In contrast, the values specified by KB and KE apply only to
        the selected lines; that is, lines subsequently generated from
        these lines will not share these attributes.  Similarly, if a
        line does not have KB and KE attributes associated with it via
        the LATT command at the time it is meshed, ANSYS cannot obtain
        the attributes from elsewhere.  See the discussion on beam
        meshing in Meshing Your Solid Model in the Modeling and
        Meshing Guide for more information.

        Reissue the LATT command (before lines are meshed) to change
        the attributes.  A zero (or blank) argument removes the
        corresponding association. If any of the arguments are defined
        as -1, then that value will be left unchanged in the selected
        set.

        In some cases, ANSYS can proceed with a line meshing operation
        even when no logical element type has been assigned via
        LATT,,,TYPE or TYPE.  See Meshing Your Solid Model in the
        Modeling and Meshing Guide for more information about setting

        Concatenates multiple, adjacent lines (the input lines) into one line
        (the output line) in preparation for mapped meshing.  An area that
        contains too many lines for mapped meshing can still be mapped meshed
        if some of the lines in that area are first concatenated (see Meshing
        Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for details on
        mapped meshing restrictions).

        LCCAT is meant to be used solely for meshing and cannot be used for any
        other purposes.  Specifically, (a) the output line and any areas that
        have the output line on their line list [ALIST] cannot be used as input
        to any other solid modeling operation (not even another LCCAT command);
        and (b) the output line cannot accept solid model boundary conditions
        [DL, SFL].

        The output line will take on the element divisions of the input lines
        and will not accept element divisions that are directly assigned
        [LESIZE].  The output line from the LCCAT operation will be coincident
        with the input lines and the input lines will be retained.  Consider
        the LCOMB command instead of LCCAT if you wish to delete the input
        lines and if the lines to be combined have similar slopes at the common
        keypoint(s).  When an LCCAT command is issued, area line lists [ALIST]
        that contain all of the input lines will be updated so that the area
        line lists refer to the output line instead of the input lines.
        Deletion of the output line [LDELE] effectively reverses the LCCAT
        operation and restores area line lists to their original condition.

        You can use the LSEL command to select lines that were created by
        concatenation, and then follow it with an LDELE,ALL command to delete
        them.  Also see Meshing Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing

            number of divisions is automatically calculated from the line
            length (rounded upward to next integer).  If SIZE is zero (or

        angsiz
            The division arc (in degrees) spanned by the element edge (except
            for straight lines, which always result in one division).  The
            number of divisions is automatically calculated from the line
            length (rounded upward to next integer).

        ndiv
            If positive, NDIV is the number of element divisions per line.  If
            -1 (and KFORC = 1), NDIV is assumed to be zero element divisions
            per line. TARGE169 with a rigid specification ignores NDIV and will
            always mesh with one element division.

        space
            Spacing ratio.  If positive, nominal ratio of last division size to
            first division size (if > 1.0, sizes increase, if < 1.0, sizes
            decrease).  If negative, ``|SPACE|`` is nominal ratio of center
            division(s) size to end divisions size.  Ratio defaults to 1.0
            (uniform spacing). For layer-meshing, a value of 1.0 normally is
            used. If SPACE = FREE, ratio is determined by other considerations

        kforc
            KFORC 0-3 are used only with NL1 = ALL.  Specifies which selected
            lines are to be modified.

            0 - Modify only selected lines having undefined (zero) divisions.

            1 - Modify all selected lines.

            2 - Modify only selected lines having fewer divisions
                (including zero) than specified with this command.

            3 - Modify only selected lines having more divisions than
                specified with this command.

            4 - Modify only nonzero settings for SIZE, ANGSIZ, NDIV,
                SPACE, LAYER1, and LAYER2.  If KFORC = 4, blank or 0
                settings remain unchanged.

        layer1
            Layer-meshing control parameter.  Distance which defines the
            thickness of the inner mesh layer, LAYER1.  Elements in this layer
            are uniformly-sized with edge lengths equal to the specified
            element size for the line (either through SIZE or line-
            length/NDIV).  A positive value for LAYER1 is interpreted as an
            absolute length, while a negative value in interpreted as a
            multiplier on the specified element size for the line.  As a
            general rule, the resulting thickness of the inner mesh layer
            should be greater than or equal to the specified element size for
            the line.  If LAYER1 = OFF, layer-meshing control settings are
            cleared for the selected lines.  The default value is 0.0

        layer2
            Layer-meshing control parameter.  Distance which defines the
            thickness of the outer mesh layer, LAYER2.  Elements in this layer
            transition in size from those in LAYER1 to the global element size.
            A positive value of LAYER2 is interpreted as an absolute length,
            while a negative value is interpreted as a mesh transition factor.
            A value of LAYER2 = -2 would indicate that elements should
            approximately double in size as the mesh progresses normal to
            LAYER1. The default value is 0.0.

        kyndiv
            0, No, and Off means that SmartSizing cannot override specified
            divisions and spacing ratios. Mapped mesh fails if divisions do not
            match. This defines the specification as "hard".

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of the number of elements outward
            from the indicated lines (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        LREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified lines. By
        default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements with
        1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        LREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified lines. Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified lines, but are not tetrahedra (for example,
        hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial

        Wherever two area or volume elements share a common face, MCHECK
        verifies that the way the elements are connected to the face is
        consistent with their relative normals or integrated volumes. (This may
        detect folds or otherwise overlapping elements.)

        MCHECK verifies that the element exterior faces form simply-connected
        closed surfaces. (This may detect unintended cracks in a mesh.)

        MCHECK warns if the number of element facets in a 2-D loop or 3-D
        shell is not greater than a computed limit. This limit is the smaller
        of either three times the number of faces on one element, or one-tenth
        the total number of element faces in the model. (This may detect holes
        in the middle of a mesh.)

        The MCHECK command will perform a number of validity checks on the
        selected elements, including:

        Normal check:  Wherever two area elements share a common edge, MCHECK
        verifies that the ordering of the nodes on each element is consistent
        with their relative normals.

        Volume check:  Wherever two volume elements share a common face, MCHECK
        verifies that the sign of the integrated volume of each element is
        consistent.

        Closed surface check:  MCHECK verifies that the element exterior faces
        form simply-connected closed surfaces (this may detect unintended
        cracks in a mesh).

        Check for holes in the mesh:  MCHECK warns if the number of element
        faces surrounding an interior void in the mesh is small enough to
        suggest one or more accidentally omitted elements, rather than a
        deliberately formed hole. For this test, the number of faces around the
        void is compared to the smaller of a) three times the number of faces
        on one element, or b) one-tenth the total number of element faces in
        the model.

        """Specifies meshing options.

        APDL Command: MOPT

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Meshing option to be specified (determines the meaning of Value):

            AORDER - Mesh by ascending area size order.  Set Value to ON to mesh smaller areas
                     first. Using this results in finer meshes in critical
                     areas for volume meshes; this can be used for cases where
                     SMRTSIZE does not mesh as needed. Default is OFF.

            EXPND - Area mesh expansion (or contraction) option.  (This option is the same as
                    SMRTSIZE,,,EXPND.) This option is used to size internal
                    elements in an area based on the size of the elements on
                    the area's boundaries.

            Value is the expansion (or contraction) factor. For example, issuing MOPT,EXPND,2 before meshing an area will allow a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the interior of an area as they are on the boundary. If Value is less than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the area will be allowed. Value for this option should be greater than 0.5 but less than 4.  - Value defaults to 1, which does not allow expansion or contraction of internal
                              element sizes (except when using AESIZE sizing).
                              If Value = 0, the default value of 1 will be
                              used. The actual size of the internal elements
                              will also depend on the TRANS option (or upon
                              AESIZE or ESIZE sizing, if used).

            TETEXPND - Tet-mesh expansion (or contraction) option. This option is used to size
                       internal elements in a volume based on the size of the
                       elements on the volume's boundaries.

            Value is the expansion (or contraction) factor.  For example, issuing MOPT,TETEXPND,2 before meshing a volume will allow a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the interior of the volume as they are on the boundary. If Value is less than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the volume will be allowed. Value for this option should be greater than 0.1 but less than 3.   - Value defaults to 1, which does not allow expansion or contraction of internal
                              element sizes.  If Value = 0, the default value
                              of 1 will be used. If Value is greater than 2,
                              mesher robustness may be affected.

            The TETEXPND option is supported for both the VMESH and FVMESH commands.  Tet-mesh expansion is the only mesh control supported by FVMESH. - TRANS

            Mesh-transition option. Controls how rapidly elements are permitted to change in size from the boundary to the interior of an area. (This option performs the same operation as SMRTSIZE,,,,TRANS.)   - Value is the transitioning factor. Value defaults to 2.0, which permits
                              elements to approximately double in size as they
                              approach the interior of the area.  (If Value =
                              0, the default value of 2 will be used.) Value
                              must be greater than 1 and, for best results,
                              should be less than 4.  The actual size of the
                              internal elements will also depend on the EXPND
                              option (or upon AESIZE or ESIZE sizing, if used).

            For a quad mesh with any element size, this option has no effect, as the program strictly respects any face size to ensure the most uniform quad mesh possible. To obtain a graded mesh using this option, apply LESIZE to the lines of the desired face. - AMESH

            Triangle surface-meshing option.  Valid inputs for Value are:     - DEFAULT

            Allows the program to choose which triangle mesher to use.  In most cases, the program chooses the main triangle mesher, which is the Riemann space mesher.  If the chosen mesher fails for any reason, the program invokes the alternate mesher and retries the meshing operation. - MAIN

            The program uses the main triangle mesher (Riemann space mesher), and it does not invoke an alternate mesher if the main mesher fails.  The Riemann space mesher is well suited for most surfaces. - ALTERNATE

            The program uses the first alternate triangle mesher (3-D tri-mesher), and it does not invoke another mesher if this mesher fails.  This option is not recommended due to speed considerations.  However, for surfaces with degeneracies in parametric space, this mesher often provides the best results. - ALT2

            The program uses the second alternate triangle mesher (2-D parametric space mesher), and it does not invoke another mesher if this mesher fails.  This option is not recommended for use on surfaces with degeneracies (spheres, cones, etc.) or poorly parameterized surfaces because poor meshes may result. - QMESH

            Quadrilateral surface meshing option.  (Quadrilateral surface meshes will differ based on which triangle surface mesher is selected.  This is true because all free quadrilateral meshing algorithms use a triangle mesh as a starting point.)  Valid inputs for Value are:     - DEFAULT

            Let the program choose which quadrilateral mesher to use.  In most cases, the program will choose the main quadrilateral mesher, which is the Q-Morph (quad-morphing) mesher.  For very coarse meshes, the program may choose the alternate quadrilateral mesher instead.  In most cases, the Q-Morph mesher results in higher quality elements.  If either mesher fails for any reason, the program invokes the other mesher and retries the meshing operation.  (Default.) - MAIN

            The program uses the main quadrilateral mesher (Q-Morph mesher), and it does not invoke the alternate mesher if the main mesher fails. - ALTERNATE

            The program uses the alternate quadrilateral mesher, and it does not invoke the Q-Morph mesher if the alternate mesher fails.  To use the alternate quadrilateral mesher, you must also select MOPT,AMESH,ALTERNATE or MOPT,AMESH,ALT2. - VMESH

            Tetrahedral element meshing option.  Valid inputs for Value are:     - DEFAULT

            Let the program choose which tetrahedra mesher to use.   - MAIN

            Use the main tetrahedra mesher (Delaunay technique mesher).  (GHS3D meshing technology by P. L. George, INRIA, France.)  For most models, this mesher is significantly faster than the alternate mesher. - ALTERNATE

            Use the alternate tetrahedra mesher (advancing front mesher).  This mesher does not support the generation of a tetrahedral volume mesh from facets (FVMESH).  If this mesher is selected and you issue the FVMESH command, the program uses the main tetrahedra mesher to create the mesh from facets and issues a warning message to notify you. - SPLIT

            Quad splitting option for non-mapped meshing.  If Value = 1, ON, or ERR, quadrilateral elements in violation of shape error limits are split into triangles (default).  If Value = 2 or WARN, quadrilateral elements in violation of either shape error or warning limits are split into triangles.  If Value = OFF, splitting does not occur, regardless of element quality. - LSMO

            Line smoothing option. Value can be ON or OFF.  If Value = ON, smoothing of nodes on area boundaries is performed during smoothing step of meshing.  During smoothing, node locations are adjusted to achieve a better mesh.  If Value = OFF (default), no smoothing takes place at area boundaries. - CLEAR

            This option affects the element and node numbering after clearing a mesh.  If Value = ON (default), the starting node and element numbers will be the lowest available number after the nodes and elements are cleared.  If Value = OFF, the  starting node and element numbers are not reset after the clear operation. - PYRA

        "Mapped triangle meshing" refers to the ANSYS program's ability to take
        a map-meshable area and mesh it with triangular elements, based on the
        value of MSHPATTERN,KEY. This type of meshing is particularly useful
        for analyses that involve the meshing of rigid contact elements.

        The MSHPATTERN command is valid only when you have specified that ANSYS
        use triangle-shaped elements [MSHAPE,1,2D] (or you are meshing with an
        element that supports only triangles), and you have also specified
        mapped meshing [MSHKEY,1] to mesh an area.

        nn1, nn2, ninc
            Nodes (NN1 to NN2 in increments of NINC) around which the mesh is
            to be refined.  NN2 defaults to NN1, and NINC defaults to 1.  If

            component name may also be substituted for NN1 (NN2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of number of elements outward
            from the indicated nodes (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        NREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified nodes.  By
        default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements with
        1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        NREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified nodes.  Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified nodes, but are not tetrahedra (for example,
        hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements.  This applies
        to nodes and elements anywhere in the model, not just in the region

        APDL Command: PSMESH

        Parameters
        ----------
        secid
            Unique section number. This number must not already be assigned to
            a section.

        name
            Unique eight character descriptive name, if desired.

        p0
            Pretension node number. The node will be defined if it doesn't
            exist and the number defaults to the highest node number plus one.

        egroup, num
            Element group on which PSMESH will operate. If Egroup = P,
            graphical picking is enabled and NUM is ignored (valid only in the
            GUI).

            L (or LINE) - PSMESH operates on all elements in the line specified by NUM. New pretension
                          nodes are associated with NUM or entities below it.
                          Any subsequent LCLEAR operation of NUM deletes the
                          pretension elements and nodes created by PSMESH.

            A (or AREA) - PSMESH operates on all elements in the area specified by NUM. New pretension
                          nodes are associated with NUM or entities below it.
                          Any subsequent ACLEAR of NUM deletes the pretension
                          elements and nodes created by PSMESH.

            V (or VOLU) - PSMESH operates on all elements in the volume specified by NUM. New pretension
                          nodes are associated with NUM or entities below it.
                          Any subsequent VCLEAR of NUM deletes the pretension
                          elements and nodes created by PSMESH.

            P - PSMESH operates on elements selected through the subsequent picking operations,
                and NUM is ignored

            ALL - The command operates on all selected elements, and NUM is ignored.

        kcn
            Coordinate system number for the separation surface and normal
            direction.

        kdir
            Direction (x, y, or z) normal to separation surface in the KCN
            coordinate system.

        value
            Point along the KDIR axis at which to locate the separation
            surface. Ignored if NDPLANE is supplied.

        ndplane
            Existing node that PSMESH will use to locate the separation
            surface. If NDPLANE is supplied, the location of the separation
            surface is defined by the KDIR coordinate of NDPLANE.

        pstol
            Optional tolerance below VALUE. Allows nodes occurring precisely at
            or slightly below the separation  to be identified properly as
            above the plane. Has the effect of shifting the plane down by
            PSTOL.  The following expression represents the default value:

        pstype
            If specified, this value is the type number for pretension
            elements. (If not specified, ANSYS defines this value.) If already
            defined, it must be of type PRETS179.

        ecomp
            If specified, the name of a component to be composed of new
            pretension elements and existing elements modified by the PSMESH
            command.

        ncomp
            Name of a component to be composed of nodes on new pretension
            elements.

        Notes
        -----
        The PSMESH command creates a pretension section normal to the
        pretension load direction by cutting the mesh along existing element
        boundaries at the point defined by VALUE or NDPLANE and inserting
        PRETS179 elements. The PSMESH command verifies that PSTYPE is PRETS179;
        if it is not, the command finds the lowest available ITYPE that is
        PRETS179, or if necessary will create a new one.

        When it is necessary to define the pretension node, ANSYS uses node
        NDPLANE. If the NDPLANE value is not specified, ANSYS defines the
        pretension node at:

        The centroid of geometric entity NUM, if Egroup = LINE, AREA or VOLU

        The centroid location of all selected elements, if Egroup = ALL or if
        graphical picking is used.

        If the elements to which the pretension load is to be applied have
        already been meshed in two groups, PSMESH cannot be used to insert the
        pretension elements. The EINTF command must be used to insert the
        PRETS179 elements between the two meshed groups.

        The PSMESH operation copies any nodal temperatures you have defined on
        the split surface of the original mesh from the original nodes to the
        newly created coincident duplicate nodes. However, displacements,
        forces, and other boundary conditions are not copied.

        By mathematical definition, the pretension surface must always be a
        flat plane. In a non-Cartesian coordinate system, the PSMESH command
        creates that plane at the indicated position, oriented with respect to
        the specified direction of the active system (in the same manner that
        the NROTAT command orients a nodal system with respect to a curved
        system). For example, assuming a X = 1 and Y = 45 in a cylindrical
        coordinate system with Z as the axis of rotation (KCN = 1), a
        pretension surface normal to X tilts 45 degrees away from the global X
        axis.

        The PSMESH command is valid for structural analyses only.

        APDL Command: SHPP

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Shape checking option.  (When Lab = WARN, STATUS, SUMMARY, or
            DEFAULT, the remaining arguments are ignored.)

            ON - Activates element shape checking.  New elements, regardless of how they are
                 created, are tested against existing warning and error limits.
                 (The existing limits may be the default limits, or previously
                 modified limits.)  Elements that violate error limits produce
                 error messages and either (a) cause a meshing failure, or (b)
                 for element creation or storage other than AMESH or VMESH, are
                 not stored.  Elements that violate warning limits produce
                 warning messages.  If shape checking was previously turned off
                 [SHPP,OFF] and you turn it on, existing elements are marked as
                 untested; use the CHECK command to retest them.  With this
                 option, you may also specify a value for VALUE1 to turn
                 individual shape tests on.  If you do not specify a value for
                 VALUE1, all shape tests are turned on.

            WARN - Activates element shape checking; however, in contrast to SHPP,ON, elements
                   that violate error limits do not cause either a meshing or
                   element storage failure.  Instead, they produce warning
                   messages to notify you that error limits have been violated.
                   This option does not alter current shape parameter limits.
                   Since the default shape parameter error limits are set to
                   allow almost any usable element, the elements this option
                   allows, which would otherwise be forbidden, are likely to be
                   very poorly shaped.

            OFF - Deactivates element shape checking.  This setting does not alter current shape
                  parameter limits.  Use of this option is risky, since poorly
                  shaped elements can lead to analysis results that are less
                  accurate than would otherwise be expected for a given mesh
                  density.  With this option, you may also specify a value for
                  VALUE1 to turn individual shape tests off.  If you do not
                  specify a value for VALUE1, all element shape tests are
                  turned off.

            SILENT - Determines whether element shape checking runs in silent mode.  In silent mode,
                     ANSYS checks elements without issuing warnings, with the
                     exception of the generic warnings that it issues at
                     solution.  With this option, you must also specify a value
                     for VALUE1  (During the execution of certain commands,
                     ANSYS automatically runs element shape checking in silent
                     mode, then internally summarizes the shape test results
                     for all of the new or modified elements.  ANSYS does this
                     when it executes any of the following commands:  AGEN,
                     AMESH, AREFINE, ARSYM, ATRAN, CDREAD, EGEN, ENGEN, ENSYM,
                     EREAD, EREFINE, ESYM, ET, FVMESH, KREFINE, LREFINE,
                     NREFINE, TIMP, VEXT, VGEN, VIMP, VMESH, VOFFST, VROTAT,
                     VSWEEP, VSYMM, and VTRAN.)

            STATUS - Lists the shape parameter limits currently in effect, along with status
                     information about element shape checking (for example,
                     whether any individual shape tests are off, whether any of
                     the shape parameter limits have been modified, and so on).

            SUMMARY - Lists a summary of element shape test results for all selected elements.

            DEFAULT - Resets element shape parameter limits to their default values.  Also, if any
                      individual tests were turned off, turns them back on.
                      (The SHPP,DEFAULT command may be useful if any parameter
                      limits were previously altered by using the MODIFY
                      option.)

            OBJECT - Determines whether element shape test results data is stored in memory.  When
                     this option is turned on, an "object" is created for
                     storing test results in memory.  When this option is
                     turned off, no object is created and no data is stored;
                     thus, any operation that requires shape parameters for an
                     existing element (such as use of the CHECK command) causes
                     the shape parameters to be recomputed.  (Note the
                     distinction between storing the data in memory and storing
                     it in the database; regardless of whether this option is
                     turned on or off, no element shape test results data will
                     be stored in the database.  The element shape parameter
                     object is deleted automatically before any solution.)
                     This setting is independent of shape checking status, with
                     one exception--if shape checking is turned off [SHPP,OFF],
                     the object is not created.  Keep in mind that recomputing
                     shape parameters is more computationally expensive than
                     retrieving them from the object.  With this option, you
                     must also specify a value for the VALUE1 argument; the
                     VALUE2 argument is ignored.

            LSTET - Determines, for Jacobian ratio tests, whether sampling is done at integration
                    points (DesignSpace product method), or at corner nodes.
                    When this option is turned on, sampling is done at
                    integration points, and the default limits for h-element
                    Jacobian ratios are a warning tolerance of 10 and an error
                    tolerance of 40. When this option is turned off, sampling
                    is done at corner nodes, and the corresponding default
                    limits are a warning tolerance of 30 and an error tolerance
                    of 1000. Sampling at the integration points (option on)
                    results in a lower Jacobian ratio, but that ratio is also
                    subjected to a more restrictive error limit. Some elements
                    that have passed the integration point sampling criterion,
                    have failed the corner mode sampling criterion. Because of
                    this, use integration point sampling only for simple linear
                    analyses. For other types of analyses (e.g., nonlinear,
                    electromagnetic), use sampling at corner nodes, which is
                    the more conservative approach. With this option, you must
                    also specify a value for the VALUE1 argument; the VALUE2
                    argument is ignored.

            MODIFY - Indicates that you want to respecify a shape parameter limit.  With this
                     option, you must also specify values for the VALUE1 and
                     VALUE2 arguments.

            FLAT - Determines the warning and error limits used to test elements that may exhibit
                   nonzero/nonconstant Z coordinates. With this option, you
                   must also specify values for the VALUE1 and/or VALUE2
                   arguments.

        value1
            Valid for the ON, OFF, SILENT, OBJECT, LSTET, MODIFY, and FLAT
            options only.  When Lab = ON or OFF, use VALUE1 to individually
            control (that is, turn off or turn on) specific element shape
            tests.  Thus, VALUE1 can be ANGD (SHELL28 corner angle deviation
            tests), ASPECT (aspect ratio tests), PARAL (deviation from
            parallelism of opposite edges tests), MAXANG (maximum corner angle
            tests), JACRAT (Jacobian ratio tests), WARP (warping factor tests),
            or ALL (all tests). When Lab = SILENT, VALUE1 can be ON (to turn
            silent mode on) or OFF (to turn silent mode off).  When Lab =
            OBJECT, VALUE1 can be either 1, YES, or ON to turn on storage of
            element shape test data (the default); or it can be 0, NO, or OFF
            to turn off storage of element shape test data (delete the data and

            YES, or ON to choose Jacobian sampling at integration points; or it
            can be 0, NO, or OFF to choose Jacobian sampling at nodes (the
            default). When Lab = MODIFY, VALUE1 is the numeric location (within
            the shape parameter limit array) of the shape parameter limit to be
            modified.  Locations are identified in the element shape checking
            status listing [SHPP,STATUS].  For more information, see the

        APDL Command: SMRTSIZE

        Parameters
        ----------
        sizlvl
            Overall element size level for meshing.  The level value controls
            the fineness of the mesh.  (Any input in this field causes
            remaining arguments to be ignored.)   Valid inputs are:

            n - Activate SmartSizing and set the size level to n.  Must be an integer value
                from 1 (fine mesh) to 10 (coarse mesh).  Remaining arguments
                are ignored, and argument values are set as shown in
                Table 229: SMRTSIZE - Argument Values for h-elements .

            STAT - List current SMRTSIZE settings.

            DEFA - Set all SMRTSIZE settings to default values (as shown in Table 229: SMRTSIZE -
                   Argument Values for h-elements  for size level 6).

            OFF - Deactivate SmartSizing.  Current settings of DESIZE will be used.  To
                  reactivate SmartSizing, issue SMRTSIZE,n.

        fac
            Scaling factor applied to the computed default mesh sizing.
            Defaults to 1 for h-elements (size level 6), which is medium.
            Values from 0.2 to 5.0 are allowed.

        expnd
            Mesh expansion (or contraction) factor.  (This factor is the same
            as MOPT,EXPND,Value.)  EXPND is used to size internal elements in
            an area based on the size of the elements on the area's boundaries.
            For example, issuing SMRTSIZE,,,2 before meshing an area will allow
            a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the
            interior of an area as they are on the boundary.   If EXPND is less
            than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the area
            will be allowed.  EXPND should be greater than 0.5 but less than 4.
            EXPND defaults to 1 for h-elements (size level 6), which does not
            allow expansion or contraction of internal element sizes (except
            when using AESIZE element sizing).  (If EXPND is set to zero, the
            default value of 1 will be used.)  The actual size of the internal
            elements will also depend on the TRANS option or upon AESIZE or
            ESIZE sizing, if used.

        trans
            Mesh transition factor.  (This factor is the same as
            MOPT,TRANS,Value.)  TRANS is used to control how rapidly elements
            are permitted to change in size from the boundary to the interior
            of an area.  TRANS defaults to 2.0 for h-elements (size level 6),
            which permits elements to approximately double in size from one
            element to the next as they approach the interior of the area.  (If
            TRANS is set to zero, the default value will be used.)   TRANS must
            be greater than 1 and, for best results, should be less than 4.
            The actual size of the internal elements will also depend on the
            EXPND option or upon AESIZE or ESIZE sizing, if used.

        angl
            Maximum spanned angle per lower-order element for curved lines.
            Defaults to 22.5 degrees per element (size level 6).  This angle
            limit may be exceeded if the mesher encounters a small feature
            (hole, fillet, etc.).  (This value is not the same as that set by
            DESIZE,,,,ANGL.)

        angh
            Maximum spanned angle per higher-order element for curved lines.
            Defaults to 30 degrees per element (size level 6).  This angle
            limit may be exceeded if the mesher encounters a small feature
            (hole, fillet, etc.).  (This value is NOT the same as that set by
            DESIZE,,,,,ANGH.)

        gratio
            Allowable growth ratio used for proximity checking.  Defaults to
            1.5 for h-elements (size level 6).  Values from 1.2 to 5.0 are
            allowed; however, values from 1.5 to 2.0 are recommended.

        smhlc
            Small hole coarsening key, can be ON (default for size level 6) or
            OFF.  If ON, this feature suppresses curvature refinement that
            would result in very small element edges (i.e., refinement around
            small features).

        smanc
            Small angle coarsening key, can be ON (default for all levels) or
            OFF.  If ON, this feature restricts proximity refinement in areas
            where it is ill-advised (that is, in tight corners on areas,
            especially those that approach 0 degrees).

        mxitr
            Maximum number of sizing iterations (defaults to 4 for all levels).

        sprx
            Surface proximity refinement key, can be off (SPRX = 0, which is
            the default for all levels) or on via two different values (SPRX =
            1 or SPRX = 2).  If SPRX = 1, surface proximity refinement is
            performed and any shell elements that need to be modified are
            modified.  If SPRX=2, surface proximity refinement is performed but
            no shell elements are altered.

        If a valid level number (1 (fine) to 10 (coarse)) is input on SIZLVL,

            Name (or the number) of the 20-node tetrahedron element that you
            want to convert.  This argument is required.

        ename2

            you want to convert the ENAME  elements.  This argument is
            required.

        etype2
            Element TYPE reference number for ENAME2.  If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not
            specified, the program selects the element TYPE reference number
            for ENAME2.  See the "Notes" section for details.  This argument is
            optional.

        Notes
        -----
        The TCHG command allows you to specify conversion of any selected
        20-node brick that is degenerated into a tetrahedron to a 10-node
        tetrahedron.

        The TCHG command is useful when used in with the MOPT,PYRA command.
        Twenty-node pyramid shaped elements may be used in the same volume with
        10-node tetrahedra.

        Performing a conversion is likely to create circumstances in which more
        than one element type is defined for a single volume.

        If specified, ETYPE2 will usually be the same as the local element TYPE
        number (ET,ITYPE) that was assigned to ENAME2 with the ET command.  You
        can specify a unique number for ETYPE2 if you prefer.  Although ETYPE2
        is optional, it may be useful when two or more ITYPEs have been
        assigned to the same element (for example, if two SOLID187 elements
        have been established in the element attribute tables for the current
        model, use the ETYPE2 argument to distinguish between them).  If ETYPE2
        is nonzero and it has not already been assigned to an element via ET,
        the program assigns the ETYPE2 value to ENAME2 as its element TYPE
        reference number.

        If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not specified, the program determines the element
        TYPE reference number for ENAME2 in one of these ways:

        If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not specified, and ENAME2 does not appear in the
        element attribute tables, the program uses the next available (unused)
        location in the element attribute tables to determine the element TYPE
        reference number for ENAME2.

        If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not specified, and ENAME2 appears in the element
        attribute tables, the program uses ENAME2 's existing element TYPE
        reference number for ETYPE2 .  (If there is more than one occurrence of
        ENAME2 in the element attribute tables (each with its own TYPE
        reference number), the program uses the first ENAME2 reference number
        for ETYPE2 .)

        You cannot use element conversion if boundary conditions or loads are
        applied directly to any selected elements.

                techniques (default).

        Notes
        -----
        The TIMP command enables you to improve a given tetrahedral mesh by
        reducing the number of poorly-shaped tetrahedral elements (in
        particular, the number of sliver tetrahedral elements)--as well as the
        overall number of elements--in the mesh.  It also improves the overall
        quality of the mesh.

        TIMP is particularly useful for an imported tetrahedral mesh for which
        no geometry information is attached.

        Regardless of the value of the CHGBND argument, boundary mid-nodes can
        be moved.

        When loads or constraints have been placed on boundary nodes or mid-
        nodes, and boundary mid-nodes are later moved, ANSYS issues a warning
        message to let you know that it will not update the loads or
        constraints.

        No boundary modification is performed if shell or beam elements are
        present in the mesh, even when CHGBND = 1.

            additional improvement techniques (default).

        Notes
        -----
        ``VIMP`` is useful for further improving a volume mesh created in ANSYS
        [``VMESH``], especially quadratic tetrahedral element meshes.

        The ``VIMP`` command enables you to improve a given tetrahedral mesh by
        reducing the number of poorly-shaped tetrahedral elements (in
        particular, the number of sliver tetrahedral elements)--as well as the
        overall number of elements--in the mesh.  It also improves the overall
        quality of the mesh.

        Regardless of the value of the ``CHGBND`` argument, boundary mid-nodes can
        be moved.

        When loads or constraints have been placed on boundary nodes or mid-
        nodes, and boundary mid-nodes are later moved, ANSYS issues a warning
        message to let you know that it will not update the loads or
        constraints.

        Even when ``CHGBND = 1``, no boundary modification is performed on areas
        and lines that are not modifiable (for example, areas that are adjacent
        to other volumes or that contain shell elements, or lines that are not
        incident on modifiable areas, contain beam elements, or have line
        divisions specified for them [``LESIZE``]).

        Parameters
        ----------
        nv1, nv2, ninc
            Mesh volumes from NV1 to NV2 (defaults to NV1) in steps of NINC
            (defaults to 1).  If NV1 = ALL, NV2 and NINC are ignored and all

            in the GUI).  A component name may also be substituted for NV1 (NV2

        Notes
        -----
        Missing nodes required for the generated elements are created and
        assigned the lowest available numbers [NUMSTR].  During a batch run and
        if elements already exist, a mesh abort will write an alternative
        database file (File.DBE) for possible recovery.

        Tetrahedral mesh expansion [MOPT,TETEXPND,Value] is supported for both
        the VMESH and FVMESH commands.

        Set the material ID and type pointers to 2, then mesh volume 1
        using mat 2 and type 2.

        Parameters
        ----------
        vnum
            Number identifying volume for which elements are to be oriented (no
            default).

        option
            Option for defining element orientation:

            KP - Orientation is determined by two keypoints on the volume. Input the keypoint
                 numbers (KZ1 and KZ2) in fields VALUE1 and VALUE2,
                 respectively. The element z-axis points from KZ1 toward KZ2.
                 Element x and y directions point away from KZ1 along edges of
                 the volume to make a right-hand triad. (The element x- and
                 y-axes are uniquely determined by this specification.)

            LINE - Orientation is determined by one of the lines defining the volume. Input the
                   line number in field VALUE1. The element z direction follows
                   the direction of the line. Input a negative value if the
                   desired z direction is opposite to the direction of the
                   specified line. (The element x- and y-axes are uniquely
                   determined by this specification.) (VALUE2 is not used.)

            AREA - Orientation is determined by one of the areas defining the volume. The area
                   represents the desired element top surface. Input the area
                   number as VALUE1. The shortest line in the volume connected
                   to the area will be used to specify the element z direction.
                   (If more than one shortest line exists, the lowest numbered
                   of those is used.) Element x and y directions are not
                   uniquely specified by this option. (VALUE2 is not used.)

            THIN - Align the element z normal to the thinnest dimension of the volume. The
                   shortest line in the volume is used to specify the element z
                   direction. (If more than one shortest line exists, the
                   lowest numbered of those is used.) Element x and y
                   directions are not uniquely specified by this option.
                   (VALUE1 and VALUE2 are not used.)

            DELE - Delete the previously defined volume orientation for the specified volume
                   (VNUM).  (VALUE1 and VALUE2 are not used.)

        value1, value2
            Parameters required for the element z-axis direction specification.
            The meaning of VALUE1 and VALUE2 will depend on the chosen Option.
            See the description of Option above for details.

        Notes
        -----
        Use VEORIENT before the VMESH command to specify the desired
        orientation of brick elements in a mapped mesh. VEORIENT has no effect
        on tetrahedron meshes, extruded meshes (VROTAT, VDRAG, VEXT, etc.), or
        swept meshes (VSWEEP).

        Proper brick orientation is essential for certain element types such as
        SOLID185 Layered Solid, SOLID186 Layered Solid, and SOLSH190. In such
        cases, use VEORIENT or EORIENT to achieve the desired orientation. For
        other brick element types, you may need to specify element orientation
        to control orthotropic material property directions without concern for
        the element connectivity. For those cases, the ESYS command is the
        preferred method of specifying the material property directions.

        For Option = LINE, AREA, and THIN, the orientation will be internally
        converted to an equivalent Option = KP specification (KP,KZ1,KZ2). Use
        the VLIST command to view the element orientations (in terms of KZ1 and
        KZ2) associated with each volume.

        APDL Command: VSWEEP
        from an adjacent area through the volume.

        Parameters
        ----------
        vnum
            Number identifying the volume that is to be meshed by VSWEEP.  If
            VNUM = P, graphical picking is enabled, you will be prompted to
            choose the volume or volumes based on the setting of
            EXTOPT,VSWE,AUTO.  This argument is required.

        srca
            Number identifying the source area.  This is the area whose mesh
            will provide the pattern for the volume elements.  (If you do not
            mesh the source area prior to volume sweeping, ANSYS meshes it
            internally when you initiate volume sweeping.)  ANSYS sweeps the
            pattern of the area elements through the volume to create the mesh
            of volume elements.  You cannot substitute a component name for
            SRCA.

        trga
            Number identifying the target area.  This is the area that is
            opposite the source area specified by SRCA.  You cannot substitute
            a component name for TRGA.

        lsmo
            Value specifying whether ANSYS should perform line smoothing during
            volume sweeping.  (The value of this argument controls line
            smoothing for the VSWEEP command only;  it has no effect on the
            setting of the MOPT command's LSMO option.)  This argument is
            optional.

            0 - Do not perform line smoothing.  This is the default.

            1 - Always perform line smoothing.  This setting is not recommended for large
                models due to speed considerations.

        Notes
        -----
        If the source mesh consists of quadrilateral elements, ANSYS fills the
        volume with hexahedral elements.  If the source mesh consists of
        triangles, ANSYS fills the volume with wedges.  If the source mesh
        consists of a combination of quadrilaterals and triangles, ANSYS fills
        the volume with a combination of hexahedral and wedge elements.

        In the past, you may have used the VROTAT, VEXT, VOFFST, and/or VDRAG
        commands to extrude a meshed area into a meshed volume.  However, those
        commands create the volume and the volume mesh simultaneously.  In
        contrast, the VSWEEP command is intended for use in an existing
        unmeshed volume.  This makes VSWEEP particularly useful when you have
        imported a solid model that was created in another program, and you
        want to mesh it in ANSYS.

        For related information, see the description of the EXTOPT command
        (although EXTOPT sets volume sweeping options, it does not affect
        element spacing). Also see the detailed discussion of volume sweeping
        in Meshing Your Solid Model of the Modeling and Meshing Guide.
