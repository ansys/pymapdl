        Notes
        -----
        The SECFUNCTION command is associated with the section most recently
        defined via the SECTYPE command.

        A table (TABLE) can define tabular thickness as a function of
        coordinates. Alternatively, you can use an array parameter (indexed by
        node number) that expresses the function to be mapped. (For example,
        func (17) should be the desired shell thickness at node 17.)  To
        specify a table, enclose the table or array name in percent signs (%)
        (SECFUNCTION,%tablename%). Use the ``*DIM`` command to define a table.

        The table or array defines the total shell thickness at any point in
        space. In multilayered sections, the total thickness and each layer
        thickness are scaled accordingly.

        The Function Tool is a convenient way to define your thickness tables.
        For more information, see Using the Function Tool in the Basic Analysis
        Guide.

        If you do not specify a local coordinate system (KCN), the program
        interprets TABLE in global XYZ coordinates. (For information about
        local coordinate systems, see the LOCAL command documentation.)

        When KCN = NODE, the program interprets TABLE as an array parameter
        (indexed by node number) that expresses the function to be mapped.

        When KCN = NOD2, the program interprets TABLE as a 2-D array parameter
        (where columns contain node numbers and rows contain the corresponding
        thicknesses) that expresses the function to be mapped.

        Notes
        -----
        The SECDATA command defines the data describing the geometry of a
        section. The command is divided into these section types: Beams, Links,
        Pipes, Axisymmetric, Taper, Shells, Pretension, Joints, Reinforcing,
        and Contact.

        The data input on the SECDATA command is interpreted based on the most
        recently issued SECTYPE command. The data required is determined by the
        section type and subtype, and is different for each one.

        Beam sections are referenced by BEAM188 and BEAM189 elements. Not all
        SECOFFSET location values are valid for each subtype.

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: RECT

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: QUAD

        Degeneration to triangle is permitted by specifying the same
        coordinates for cells along an edge.

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: CSOLID

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: CTUBE

        This subtype is similar to type PIPE. However, elements using PIPE
        account for internal or external pressures, whereas elements using
        CTUBE do not.

        SECPLOT cannot display the plot of an ASEC (arbitrary section) subtype.

        Plots the geometry of the beam or pipe section to scale depicting the
        centroid, shear center, and origin.  SECPLOT also lists various section
        properties such as Iyy, Iyz, and Izz.

        Data to be supplied in the value fields:

        Beam or pipe section mesh display options:

        Display section outline only.

        Display beam or pipe section mesh.

        Display the section mesh with node numbers.

        Display the section mesh with cell numbers.

        Display the section mesh with material numbers and colors.

        Display the section mesh with material colors only.

        Display the section mesh with the RST node numbers. RST nodes are
        section corner nodes where results are available. This is applicable
        when the averaged results format (KEYOPT(15) = 0 for BEAM188, BEAM189,
        PIPE288, and PIPE289) is used.

        Display the section mesh with the RST cell numbers. RST cells are
        section cells where results are available. This is applicable when the
        non-averaged results format (KEYOPT(15) = 1 for BEAM188, BEAM189,
        PIPE288, and PIPE289) is used.

        Options 2 through 6 do not depict centroid and shear center, nor do
        they list section properties.

        Following is a sample section plot for the beam section type:

        Plots the layer arrangement of the shell section showing the layer
        material and orientation.

        Data to be supplied in the value fields:

        The range of layer numbers to be displayed. If LAYR1 is greater than
        LAYR2, a reversed order display is produced. Up to 20 layers may be
        displayed at the same time. LAYR1 defaults to 1. LAYR2 defaults to
        LAYR1 if LAYR1 is input or to the number of layers (or to 19+LAYR1, if
        smaller) if LAYR1 is not input.

        Following is a sample section plot for the shell section type:

        Plots the arrangement of a reinforcing section within the base element.

        Data to be supplied in the value fields:

        REINF1, REINF2 -- The numerical range of reinforcings to be displayed.
        The default REINF1 value is 1. The default REINF2 value is the number
        of reinforcings.

        OVERLAY -- The section ID of the base element within which to display
        the reinforcing section. The section appears translucent and the
        reinforcing section is solid. Valid values are:

        SOLID -- Display a translucent solid block over the reinforcing section

        SECID -- A number corresponding to a specific section ID of the base
        element.

        If no OVERLAY value is specified, ANSYS displays the reinforcing

        Notes
        -----
        The SECREAD command operates on the section specified via the
        most recently issued SECTYPE command. Issue a separate SECREAD
        command for each section ID that you want to read in.

        Here are excerpts from a sample user section mesh file for a
        section with 75 nodes, 13 cells, and 9 nodes per cell for a
        two-hole box section. Illustrations of the two-hole box
        section and the cell mesh for it appear later in this command
        description.

        The mesh file is divided into three sections: the First Line,
        the Cells Section, and the Nodes Section.  Here are brief
        descriptions of the contents of each.

        First Line: The First Line defines the number of nodes and the
        number of cells for the mesh.

        Cells Section: The Cells Section contains as many lines as
        there are cells.  In this example, there are thirteen cells,
        so there are thirteen lines in this section. In each line, the
        number "1" that follows the cell connectivity information is
        the material number.

        Cell nodal connectivity must be given in a counterclockwise
        direction, with the center node being the ninth node. For
        details, see Figure: 10:: Cell Mesh for the Two-hole Box
        Section.

        Nodes Section: The Nodes Section contains as many lines as
        there are nodes.  In this example, there are 75 nodes, so
        there are a total of 75 lines in this section.  Each node line
        contains the node's boundary flag, the Y coordinate of the
        node, and the Z coordinate of the node.  Currently, all node
        boundary flags appear as 0s in a cell mesh file (as
        illustrated in Figure: 9:: Two-hole Box Section). Since all
        node boundary flags are 0, SECREAD ignores them when it reads
        a cell mesh file into ANSYS.

        There cannot be any gaps in the node numbering of a cell mesh.
        The nodes in a cell mesh must be numbered consecutively, with
        the first node having a node number of 1, and the last node
        having a node number that is equal to the maximum number of
        nodes in the cell mesh.

        subtype
            When Type = BEAM, the possible beam sections that can be defined
            for Subtype are:

        name
            An eight-character name for the section. Name can be a string such
            as "W36X210" or "HP13X73" for beam sections. Section name can
            consist of letters and numbers, but cannot contain punctuation,
            special characters, or spaces.

        refinekey
            Sets mesh refinement level for thin-walled beam sections. Valid
            values are 0 (the default - no mesh refinement) through 5 (high
            level of mesh refinement). This value has meaning only when Type =
            BEAM.

        Notes
        -----
        SECTYPE sets the section ID number, section type, and subtype for a
        section. If the section ID number is not specified, ANSYS increments
        the highest section ID number currently defined in the database by one.
        A previously-defined section with the same identification number will
        be redefined. The geometry data describing this section type is defined
        by a subsequent SECDATA command. Define the offsets by a subsequent
        SECOFFSET command. The SLIST command lists the section properties, and
        the SECPLOT command displays the section to scale. The SECNUM command
        assigns the section ID number to a subsequently-defined beam element.

        For a beam section (Type = BEAM), a subsequent SECDATA command builds a
        numeric model using a nine-node cell for determining the properties
        (Ixx, Iyy, etc.) of the section and for the solution to the Poisson's
        equation for torsional behavior. See Beam Analysis and Cross Sections
        in the Structural Analysis Guide for examples using the section
        commands.

        For a nonlinear general beam section (Type = GENB), the Subtype and
        REFINEKEY options do not apply. Subsequent commands are necessary to
        define the section: BSAX, BSM1, BSM2, BSTQ, BSS1, BSS2, BSMD, and BSTE
        are available. All other section commands are ignored for this section
        type.

        For a preintegrated composite-beam section (Type = COMB), the REFINEKEY
        options do not apply. Subsequent commands are necessary to define the
        section: CBTMP, CBMX, CBMD, and CBTE are available. All other section
        commands are ignored for this section type.

        For a tapered beam or pipe section (Type = TAPER), two subsequent
        SECDATA commands are required (one for each end section). Section ends
        must be topologically identical (same Subtype, number of cells and
        material IDs). For a tapered pipe section, end sections must have the
        same number of cells around the circumference and along the pipe wall,
        and the same shell section ID for a composite pipe wall.

            Factor to increase axial flexibility. The default value is 1.0.

        ffby
            Factor to increase bending flexibility about element y axis
            (bending in the element x-z plane). The default value is 1.0.

        ffbz
            Factor to increase bending flexibility about element z axis
            (bending in the element x-y plane). The default value is FFBY.

        ffto
            Factor to increase torsional flexibility. The default value is 1.0.

        fftsy
            Factor to increase transverse shear flexibility in the element x-z
            plane. The default value is 1.0.

        fftsz
            Factor to increase transverse shear flexibility in the element x-y
            plane. The default value is FFTSY.

        Notes
        -----
        The SFLEX command sets section-flexibility factors for sections used by
        pipe elements.

        To increase stiffness, use a flexibility factor of less than 1.0.

        The FFBY and FFTSY arguments affect motion in the element x-z plane,
        and the FFBZ and FFTSZ arguments affect motion in the element x-y
        plane. For stout pipe structures with low slenderness ratios, set both
        FFBY and FFTSY--and/or both FFBZ and FFTSZ (the related bending and
        transverse shear factors)--to the same value to obtain the expected
        flexibility effect.

        When issued, the SFLEX command applies to the pipe section most
        recently defined via the SECTYPE command.

        SFLEX is valid only for linear material properties and small strain
        analyses. The command does not support offsets, temperature loading, or
        initial state loading. While the resulting displacements and reactions
        are valid, the stresses may not be valid.

            First section ID to be summarized. Defaults to first available

            Last section ID to be summarized. Defaults to last available

        sinc
            Increment of the section ID; defaults to 1.

        details
            Determines the content of the summarized information for beams and
            shells.

            BRIEF - For beams, lists only the section integrated properties (such as Area, Iyy, and
                    Iyz). This option is the default.

            FULL - For beams, lists the section integrated properties, as well as the section
                   nodal coordinates, section cell connectivity information,
                   and section cell integration point coordinates. For shells,
                   the section stiffness (membrane, bending, membrane-bending
                   coupling and transverse shear) are printed.

            The shell section stiffness listed considers elastic behavior of materials at reference temperature only. The elements that use the section data may alter the transverse shear stiffness based on slenderness considerations (in addition to the shear correction factors shown).  - Section stiffness terms listed via the FULL option do not include section
                              offsets. The ANSYS program considers section
                              offsets during the solution phase of the
                              analysis.

            GROUP - If a section calls other sections, this option lists those sections too.

        type\_
            The section type. Valid arguments are ALL (the default) and the
            types available on the SECTYPE command.

        """Load a pretension section.

        APDL Command: SLOAD

        Parameters
        ----------
        secid
            Unique section number. The number must already be assigned to a
            pretension section.

        plnlab
            Label representing the pretension load sequence number in the
            format "PLnn" where nn is an integer from 1 through 99 (for
            example, PL01 through PL99).

        kinit
            Initial action key for pretension load PL01. (This field is omitted
            for PL02 and up.) Three scenarios are possible:

            LOCK - Constrains (connects) the cutting plane on the pretension section. This value
                   is the default.

            SLID - Unconstrains (disconnects) the cutting plane on the pretension section.

            TINY - Applies a very small pretension load (0.1% of FDVALUE) before the desired load
                   is established. The small load prevents convergence problems
                   which can occur when the desired load is not established in
                   the first load step. This value is valid only if KFD = FORC.

        kfd
            Force/Displacement key. Specifies whether FDVALUE is a force or a
            displacement:

            FORC - Apply a force on the specified pretension section. This value is the default.

            DISP - Apply a displacement (adjustment) on the specified pretension section.

        fdvalue
            Pretension load value. If KFD = FORC, this value is a pretension
            force. If KFD = DISP, this value is a pretension displacement
            (adjustment).

        lsload
            Load step in which to apply the FDVALUE.

        lslock
            The load step in which the displacement value resulting from the
            pretension force is locked. This value is valid only if KFD = FORC.

        Notes
        -----
        The SLOAD command applies pretension loads to specified pretension
        sections (created via the PSMESH command). A pretension load is ramp-
        applied (KBC = 0) if it is a force (KFD = FORC), and step-applied (KBC
        = 1) if it is a displacement (KFD = DISP).

        You can "lock" the load value at a specified load step. When locked,
        the load changes from a force to a displacement, and ANSYS applies the
        load as a constant displacement in all future load steps. Locking is
        useful when applying additional loadings. The additional loadings alter
        the effect of the initial load value, but because locking transforms
        the load into a displacement, it preserves the initial load's effect.

        In modal and harmonic analyses, any pretension load (force,
        displacement, or locked) is ignored and no load is produced.

        The following command shows how to establish loads on a pretension
        section:

        SLOAD,1,PL01,TINY,FORC,5000,2,3

        In this example, the load is applied to pretension section 1, and the
        sequence begins with the initial action key, KINIT, set to TINY. A
        small stabilization load (5 = 0.10% of 5000) is applied in the first
        load step, as the actual pretension force is not applied until the
        second load step. The next four fields set the actual load: the KFD
        value FORC specifies the type of load, FDVALUE defines the pretension
        load value (5000), LSLOAD specifies the load step in which the force is
        applied (2), and the LSLOCK field specifies the load step in which the
        force is locked (3). Additional sets of four fields can be used to
        define additional loads.

        You can use the SLOAD command to edit (overwrite) existing loads on a
        pretension section. This example changes the load on pretension section
        1 (set above) to 6000:

        SLOAD,1,PL01,,,6000,2,3

        Unspecified values (blank fields), as shown in this example, remain
        unchanged from prior settings. If no prior specifications exist, then
        default values (KINIT = LOCK and KFD = FORC) apply.

        The command can also delete all loads on a specified pretension
        section, as shown here:

        SLOAD,1,DELETE

        For a prestressed modal analysis, this command locks the pretension
        element:
