        Specifies the system of units for magnetic field problems.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Label specifying the type of units:

            MKS - Rationalized MKS system of units (meters, amperes,
                  henries, webers, etc.).  Free-space permeability is
                  set to 4 πe-7 henries/meter. Free- space
                  permittivity is set to 8.85 e-12 F/m.

            MUZRO - User defined system of units. Free-space
                    permeability is set to the value input for
                    VALUE. Other units must correspond to the
                    permeability units. Relative permeability may be
                    altered to absolute values.

            EPZRO - User defined system of units. Free-space
                    permittivity is set to the value input for
                    VALUE. Other units must correspond to the
                    permittivity units.

        value
            User value of free-space permeability (defaults to 1) if Lab =
            MUZRO, or free-space permittivity (defaults to 1) if Lab = EPZRO.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the system of units to be used for electric and magnetic
        field problems. The free-space permeability and permittivity values may
        be set as desired. These values are used with the relative property
        values [MP] to establish absolute property values.

        Note:: : If the magnetic source field strength (Hs) has already been
        calculated [BIOT], switching EMUNIT will not change the values.

        For micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), where dimensions are on the
        order of microns, see the conversion factors in System of Units in the
        Coupled-Field Analysis Guide.

            NUXY
                Minor Poisson's ratios (also ``NUYZ``, ``NUXZ``) (``NUXY`` = νyx, as described in Stress-Strain Relationships in the
                Mechanical APDL Theory Reference)

            PERX
                Electric relative permittivities (also ``PERY``, ``PERZ``)

                .. note::  If you enter permittivity values less than 1 for ``SOLID5``, ``PLANE13``, or ``SOLID98``, the program interprets
                   the values as absolute permittivity. Values input for ``PLANE223``, ``SOLID226``, or ``SOLID227`` are always interpreted as
                   relative permittivity.

            PRXY

            polynomial is being defined, the constant term in the polynomial.

            through ``C4`` are ignored.

        c1, c2, c3, c4
            Coefficients of the linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic terms,
            respectively, in the property-versus-temperature polynomial.  Leave
            blank (or set to zero) for a constant material property.

        Notes
        -----
        MP defines a linear material property as a constant or in terms of a
        fourth order polynomial as a function of temperature. (See the TB
        command for nonlinear material property input.) Linear material
        properties typically require a single substep for solution, whereas
        nonlinear material properties require multiple substeps;  see Linear
        Material Properties in the Material Reference for details.

        If the constants ``C1`` - ``C4`` are input, the polynomial

        .. math::

           Property = C_0 + C_1(T) + C_2(T)^2 + C_3(T)^3 + C_4(T)^4

        is evaluated at discrete temperature points with linear interpolation
        between points (that is, a piecewise linear representation) and a
        constant-valued extrapolation beyond the extreme points. First-order
        properties use two discrete points (±9999°).
        The :meth:`MPTEMP <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.mptemp>` or
        :meth:`MPTGEN <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.mptgen>`
        commands must be used for second and higher order properties to define
        appropriate temperature steps. To ensure that the number of
        temperatures defined via the :meth:`MPTEMP <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.mptemp>`
        and :meth:`MPTGEN <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.mptgen>` commands is minimally
        sufficient for a reasonable representation of the curve, ANSYS
        generates an error message if the number is less than ``N``, and a warning
        message if the number is less than ``2N``. The value ``N`` represents the
        highest coefficient used; for example, if ``C3`` is nonzero and ``C4`` is zero,
        a cubic curve is being used which is defined using 4 coefficients so
        that ``N`` = 4.

        sloc
            Starting location in table for generating data.  For example, if

            A value of zero can only be assigned by C1.  Blank (or zero) values

        The /MPLIB command sets two path strings used in conjunction with the
        material library feature and the MPREAD and MPWRITE commands.

        For MPREAD, when you use the LIB option and no directory path is given
        in the file name, the command searches for the file in these locations:
        the current working directory, the user's home directory, the user-
        specified material library directory (as defined by the
        /MPLIB,READ,PATH command), and /ansys_dir/matlib.

        For MPWRITE, when you use the LIB option and the directory portion of
        the specification for the material library file is blank, the command
        writes the material  library file to the directory specified by the
        /MPLIB,WRITE,PATH command (if that path has been set).  If the path has
        not been set, the default is to write the file to the current working
        directory.

        for use in customer applications.

        Notes
        -----
        Material properties written to a file without the ``LIB`` option
        do not support nonlinear properties.  Also, properties written
        to a file without the ``LIB`` option are restored in the same
        material number as originally defined.  To avoid errors, use
        ``MPREAD`` with the ``LIB`` option only when reading files written

        If you omit the ``LIB`` option for ``MPREAD``, this command supports

        without specifying the ``LIB`` option, then read that file in
        using the ``MPREAD`` command with the ``LIB`` option, the ANSYS

            Starting location in table for entering temperatures.  For example,

            constant in the table.  If SLOC = 7, data input in the T1 field

        For clear definition, the temperature range you define with the MPTEMP

        defined materials.  To assist the user in this, the first (and only the

        fname

            the current working directory. If you use the default for your

            The file name defaults to Jobname.

            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

            If you omit the ``LIB`` option, the default extension is
            MP. If you specify the ``LIB`` option, the default extension
            is units_MPL, where units is the system of units currently
            in use. (See the description of the ``/UNITS`` command.) For
            example, if ``/UNITS`` is set to BIN, the extension defaults
            to BIN_MPL.

        lib
            The only value allowed for this field is the string ``"LIB"``.

            The ``LIB`` option indicates that you wish to have properties
            associated with the material (``MAT``) written to the
            specified material library file using the material library
            file format. The material library file format is
            ASCII-text-based ANSYS command input. Certain commands
            associated with this format have been modified to
            interpret the string "_MATL" to mean the currently
            selected material. This feature makes the material library
            file independent of the material number in effect when the
            file was written; this enables you to restore the
            properties into the ANSYS database using the material
            number of your choice. The ``LIB`` option also enables you to
            save both linear and nonlinear properties. If you omit the
            ``LIB`` option, you can save linear properties only.

        mat
            Specifies the material to be written to the named material library
            file.  There is no default; you must either specify a material or
            omit the ``MAT`` argument.  Even if you specify a ``MAT`` value, the ANSYS
            program ignores it if the ``LIB`` argument is not specified.
