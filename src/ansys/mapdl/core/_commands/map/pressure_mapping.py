        Parameters
        ----------
        filetype : str
            Type of file from which the pressure data will be retrieved (no default):

            * ``CFXTBR`` - File from a CFX Transient Blade Row (TBR) analysis export.

            * ``CFDPOST`` - File from a CFD-Post BC Profile export.

            * ``FORMATTED`` - Formatted file.

            * ``CSV`` - Comma-Separated Values file.

        prestype : int or str
            Type of pressure data contained in the file:

            * ``0`` - Only real-valued pressures are on the file.

            * ``1`` - Real-valued and imaginary-valued pressures are on the file (default).

        Notes

        .. _FTYPE_notes:

        CFX Transient Blade Row files ( ``FileType`` = CFXTBR) are obtained from the **Export Results** Tab
        in CFX-Pre, with **[Export Surface Name]: Option** set to Harmonic Forced Response.

        CFD-Post files ( ``FileType`` = CFDPOST) are obtained from the **Export** action in CFD-Post with
        **Type** set to BC Profile.

        Formatted files ( ``FileType`` = FORMATTED) contain the coordinates and pressure data in fixed-
        format columns in the order x, y, z, pressure. You may have other columns of data in the file which
        can be skipped over in the ``Format`` specifier on the :ref:`read` command, but the data must be in
        that order.

        Comma-separated values files ( ``FileType`` = CSV) contain the coordinates and pressure data in
        comma-separated fields. The data can be in any order, and other fields of data may also be present.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `MAP <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_MAP.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------

        kdim : int or str
            Interpolation key:

            * ``0 or 2`` - Interpolation is done on a surface (default).

            * ``3`` - Interpolation is done within a volume. This option is useful if the supplied source data
              is volumetric field data rather than surface data.

        kout : int or str
            Key to control how pressure is applied when a target node is outside of the source region:

            * ``0`` - Use the pressure(s) of the nearest source point for target nodes outside of the region
              (default).

            * ``1`` - Set pressures outside of the region to zero.

        limit : str
            Number of nearby points considered for interpolation. The minimum is 5; the default is 20. Lower
            values reduce processing time. However, some distorted or irregular meshes will require a higher
            ``LIMIT`` value to find the points encompassing the target node in order to define the region
            for interpolation.
