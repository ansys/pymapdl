        -------

        Notes
        -----

        .. _A_notes:

        Keypoints ( ``P1`` through ``P18`` ) must be input in a clockwise or counterclockwise order around
        the area. This order also determines the positive normal direction of the area according to the
        right-hand rule. Existing lines between adjacent keypoints will be used; missing lines are generated
        "straight" in the active coordinate system and assigned the lowest available numbers ( :ref:`numstr`
        ). If more than one line exists between two keypoints, the shorter one will be chosen. If the area
        is to be defined with more than four keypoints, the required keypoints and lines must lie on a
        constant coordinate value in the active coordinate system (such as a plane or a cylinder). Areas may
        be redefined only if not yet attached to a volume. Solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is
        not recommended.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _ADRAG_notes:

        Generates areas (and their corresponding keypoints and lines) by sweeping a given line pattern along
        a characteristic drag path. If the drag path consists of multiple lines, the drag direction is
        determined by the sequence in which the path lines are input ( ``NLP1``, ``NLP2``, etc.). If the
        drag path is a single line ( ``NLP1`` ), the drag direction is from the keypoint on the drag line
        that is closest to the first keypoint of the given line pattern to the other end of the drag line.

        The magnitude of the vector between the keypoints of the given pattern and the first path keypoint
        remains constant for all generated keypoint patterns and the path keypoints. The direction of the
        vector relative to the path slope also remains constant so that patterns may be swept around curves.

        Keypoint, line, and area numbers are automatically assigned, beginning with the lowest available
        values ( :ref:`numstr` ). Adjacent lines use a common keypoint. Adjacent areas use a common line.
        For best results, the entities to be dragged should be orthogonal to the start of the drag path.
        Drag operations that produce an error message may create some of the desired entities prior to
        terminating.

        Parameters
        ----------
        itime : str
            Do this generation operation a total of ``ITIME`` s, incrementing all keypoints in the given
            pattern automatically (or by ``KINC`` ) each time after the first. ``ITIME`` must be more than 1
            for generation to occur.

        na1 : str
            Generate areas from the pattern of areas ``NA1`` to ``NA2`` (defaults to ``NA1`` ) in steps of
            ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``NA1`` = ALL, ``NA2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored and the pattern is
            all selected areas ( :ref:`asel` ). If ``NA1`` = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining arguments are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may also be
            substituted for ``NA1`` ( ``NA2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored).

        na2 : str
            Generate areas from the pattern of areas ``NA1`` to ``NA2`` (defaults to ``NA1`` ) in steps of
            ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``NA1`` = ALL, ``NA2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored and the pattern is
            all selected areas ( :ref:`asel` ). If ``NA1`` = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining arguments are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may also be
            substituted for ``NA1`` ( ``NA2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored).

        ninc : str
            Generate areas from the pattern of areas ``NA1`` to ``NA2`` (defaults to ``NA1`` ) in steps of
            ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``NA1`` = ALL, ``NA2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored and the pattern is
            all selected areas ( :ref:`asel` ). If ``NA1`` = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining arguments are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may also be
            substituted for ``NA1`` ( ``NA2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored).

        dx : str
            Keypoint location increments in the active coordinate system (--, D θ, DZ for cylindrical; --, D
            θ, -- for spherical).

        dy : str
            Keypoint location increments in the active coordinate system (--, D θ, DZ for cylindrical; --, D
            θ, -- for spherical).

        dz : str
            Keypoint location increments in the active coordinate system (--, D θ, DZ for cylindrical; --, D
            θ, -- for spherical).

        kinc : str
            Keypoint number increment between generated sets. If zero, the lowest available keypoint numbers
            are assigned ( :ref:`numstr` }.

        noelem : int or str
            Specifies if elements and nodes are also to be generated:

            * ``0`` - Generate nodes and elements associated with the original areas, if they exist.

            * ``1`` - Do not generate nodes and elements.

        imove : int or str
            Specifies whether to redefine the existing areas:

            * ``0`` - Generate new areas as requested with the ``ITIME`` argument.

            * ``1`` - Move original areas to new position, retaining the same keypoint numbers ( ``ITIME``,
              ``KINC``, and ``NOELEM`` are ignored). If the original areas are needed in the original position
              (for example, they may be attached to a volume), they are not moved, and new areas are generated
              instead. Meshed items corresponding to moved areas are also moved if not needed at their original
              position.

        .. _AGEN_notes:

        Generates additional areas (and their corresponding keypoints, lines and mesh) from a given area
        pattern. The MAT, TYPE, REAL, ESYS, and SECNUM attributes of the new areas are based upon the areas
        in the pattern and not upon the current settings of the pointers. End slopes of the generated lines
        remain the same (in the active coordinate system) as those of the given pattern. For example, radial
        slopes remain radial. Generations which produce areas of a size or shape different from the pattern
        (that is, radial generations in cylindrical systems, radial and phi generations in spherical
        systems, and theta generations in elliptical systems) are not allowed. Solid modeling in a toroidal
        coordinate system is not recommended. Area and line numbers are automatically assigned, beginning
        with the lowest available values ( :ref:`numstr` ).

        .. _AL_notes:

        Lines may be input (once each) in any order and must form a simply connected closed curve. If the
        area is defined with more than four lines, the lines must also lie in the same plane or on a
        constant coordinate value in the active coordinate system (such as a plane or a cylinder). Solid
        modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is not recommended. Areas may be redefined only if not yet
        attached to a volume.

        You cannot use the :ref:`anorm` command to change the normal direction of any element that has a
        body or surface load. We recommend that you apply all of your loads only after ensuring that the
        element normal directions are acceptable.

            Area number of the area whose normal is to be reversed. If ``ANUM`` = ALL, the normals of all

            Indicates whether you want to change the normal direction of the existing elements on the reversed
            area(s) so that they are consistent with each area's new normal direction.

            * ``0`` - Make the normal direction of existing elements on the reversed area(s) consistent with
              each area's new normal direction (default).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _AREVERSE_notes:

        You cannot use the :ref:`areverse` command to change the normal direction of any element that has a
        body or surface load. We recommend that you apply all of your loads only after ensuring that the
        element normal directions are acceptable. Also, you cannot use this command to change the normal
        direction for areas attached to volumes because IGES and ANF data is unchanged by reversal. Reversed
        areas that are attached to volumes need to be reversed again when imported.

        Real constants (such as nonuniform shell thickness and tapered beam constants) may be invalidated by
        an element reversal.

            system. ( RR, R θ, RZ for cylindrical; RR, R θ, R Φ for spherical). Note that the R θ and R Φ
            scale factors are interpreted as angular offsets. For example, if CSYS = 1, ``RX, RY, RZ`` input
            of (1.5,10,3) would scale the specified keypoints 1.5 times in the radial and 3 times in the Z
            direction, while adding an offset of 10 degrees to the keypoints. Zero, blank, or negative scale
            factor values are assumed to be 1.0. Zero or blank angular offsets have no effect.

        ry : str
            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates in the active coordinate
            system. ( RR, R θ, RZ for cylindrical; RR, R θ, R Φ for spherical). Note that the R θ and R Φ

        kinc : str
            Increment to be applied to keypoint numbers for generated set. If zero, the lowest available

            * ``0`` - Additional areas will be generated.

            * ``1`` - Original areas will be moved to new position ( ``KINC`` and ``NOELEM`` are ignored). Use

        .. _ASKIN_notes:

        Generates an area by "skinning" a surface through specified guiding lines. The lines act as a set of
        "ribs" over which a surface is "stretched." Two opposite edges of the area are framed by the first (
        ``NL1`` ) and last ( NLn ) guiding lines specified. The other two edges of the area are framed by
        splines-fit lines which the program automatically generates through the ends of all guiding lines.
        The interior of the area is shaped by the interior guiding lines. Once the area has been created,
        only the four edge lines will be attached to it. In rare cases, it may be necessary to change the
        default algorithm used by the :ref:`askin` command (see :ref:`ASKIN_extranote1` below).

        .. _ASKIN_extranote1:

        When skinning from one guiding line to the next, the program can create the transition area in one
        of two ways: one more spiraled and one less spiraled ("flatter"). By default, the program attempts
        to produce the flatter transition, instead of the more spiraled transition. This algorithm can be
        changed by inputting ``NL1`` as a negative number, in which case the program connects all the
        keypoints at the line "beginnings" ( :ref:`psymb`,LDIR command) as one edge of the area, and all the
        line "ends" as the opposite edge, irrespective of the amount of spiraling produced in each
        transition area.

        To further control the geometry of the area (if ``NL1`` is negative), the beginning and end of any
        specified line (other than ``NL1`` ) can be temporarily interchanged (for the skinning operation
        only) by inputting that line number as negative. See `Solid Modeling

        lab : str
            Controls the degree of tessellation used in the calculation of area properties. If ``LAB`` =
            DEFAULT, area calculations will use the degree of tessellation set through the :ref:`facet`
            command. If ``LAB`` = FINE, area calculations are based on a finer tessellation.

        .. _ASUM_notes:

        Calculates and prints geometry statistics (area, centroid location, moments of inertia, volume,
        etc.) associated with the selected areas. :ref:`asum` should only be used on perfectly flat areas.

        Geometry items are reported in the global Cartesian coordinate system. A unit thickness is assumed
        unless the areas have a non-zero total thickness defined by real constant or section data.

        For layered areas, a unit density is always assumed. For single-layer areas, a unit density is
        assumed unless the areas have a valid material (density).

        The thickness and density are associated to the areas via the :ref:`aatt` command.

        Items calculated via :ref:`asum` and later retrieved via a :ref:`get` or :ref:`starvget` command are
        valid only if the model is not modified after issuing the :ref:`asum` command.

        Setting a finer degree of tessellation will provide area calculations with greater accuracy,
        especially for thin, hollow models. However, using a finer degree of tessellation requires longer
        processing.

        For very narrow (sliver) areas, such that the ratio of the minimum to the maximum dimension is less
        than 0.01, the :ref:`asum` command can provide erroneous area information. To ensure that the
        calculations are accurate, subdivide such areas so that the ratio of the minimum to the maximum is
        at least 0.05.

        kinc : str
            Keypoint increment between sets. If zero, the lowest available keypoint numbers are assigned (
            :ref:`numstr` ).

        noelem : int or str
            Specifies whether elements and nodes are also to be generated:

            * ``0`` - Generate nodes and elements associated with the original areas, if they exist.

            * ``1`` - Do not generate nodes and elements.

        imove : int or str
            Specifies whether to redefine the existing areas:

            * ``0`` - Generate additional areas.

            * ``1`` - Move original areas to new position retaining the same keypoint numbers ( ``KINC`` and
              ``NOELEM`` are ignored). Valid only if the old areas are no longer needed at their original
              positions. Corresponding meshed items are also moved if not needed at their original position.
