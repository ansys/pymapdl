        The data input on the :ref:`secdata` command is interpreted based on the most recently issued
        :ref:`sectype` command. The data required is determined by the section type and subtype, and is
        different for each one.

        .. _SECDATA_beams:

        Type: BEAM
        Beam sections are referenced by ``BEAM188``and ``BEAM189``elements. Not all :ref:`secoffset`
        location values are valid for each subtype.

        InformalTables need to be added.

        .. _SECDATA_contact:

        Type: CONTACT
        Geometry Correction Contact sections for geometry correction ( ``Subtype`` = CIRCLE, SPHERE, or
        CYLINDER) are referenced
        by the following elements: ``TARGE169``, ``TARGE170``, ``CONTA172``, and ``CONTA174``. This geometry
        correction applies to cases where the original meshes of contact elements or target elements are
        located on a portion of a circular, spherical, or revolute surface.

        **Type: CONTACT, Subtype: CIRCLE**

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = CIRCLE:
        * ``X0``, ``Y0`` (circle center location in Global Cartesian coordinates - XY plane)

        **Type: CONTACT, Subtype: SPHERE**

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = SPHERE:
        * ``X0``, ``Y0``, ``Z0`` (sphere center location in Global Cartesian coordinates)

        **Type: CONTACT, Subtype: CYLINDER**

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = CYLINDER:
        * ``X1``, ``Y1``, ``Z1``, ``X2``, ``Y2``, ``Z2`` (two ends of cylindrical axis in Global Cartesian
          coordinates)

        User-Defined Contact Surface Normal The contact section for a user-defined contact surface normal (
        ``Subtype`` = NORMAL) is referenced
        by the following elements: ``CONTA172``, ``CONTA174``, and ``CONTA175``. This geometry correction is
        used to define a `shift direction for interference fit
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_ctec/ctecgeomcor.html#>`_ solutions.

        **Type: CONTACT, Subtype: NORMAL**

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = NORMAL:
        * ``CSYS``, ``NX``, ``NY``, ``NZ``
        * where:
        * ``CSYS`` = Local coordinate system number (defaults to global Cartesian).
        * ``NX``, ``NY``, ``NZ`` = Direction cosines with respect to ``CSYS.``

        Radius values associated with contact or target elements The radius contact section ( ``Subtype`` =
        RADIUS) is referenced by contact or target elements in a general contact definition under the
        following circumstances:

        * **Equivalent 3D contact radius for beam-to-beam contact** - The contact section for a user-defined
          equivalent contact radius ( ``Subtype`` = RADIUS) is referenced by the element type
          ``CONTA177``within a general contact definition. 3D beam-to-beam contact (or edge-to-edge contact)
          modeled by this line contact element assumes that its surface is a cylindrical surface.

        * **Radius (or radii) of rigid target segments** - The contact section for rigid target segment
          radii is referenced by target elements ``TARGE169``(circle segment type) and ``TARGE170``(line,
          parabola, cylinder, sphere, or cone segment type) in a general contact definition.

        **Type: CONTACT, Subtype: RADIUS**

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = RADIUS if the section is used as an
          equivalent contact radius for 3D beam-to-beam contact:
        * ``VAL1`` = Equivalent radius - outer radius
        * ``VAL2`` = Equivalent radius - inner radius (internal beam-to-beam contact)
        * ``VAL3`` : Set to 1 for internal beam-to-beam contact. Defaults to external beam-to-beam contact.

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = RADIUS if the section is used for 2D or 3D
          rigid target segments:
        * ``VAL1`` = First radius of the target segment (used for circle, line, parabola, cylinder, sphere,
          and cone segment types)
        * ``VAL2`` = Second radius of the target segment (used only for the cone segment type)

        Simplified Bolt Thread Modeling The contact section for bolt-thread modeling ( ``Subtype`` = BOLT)
        is referenced by the following
        elements: ``CONTA172``, ``CONTA174``, and ``CONTA175``. It applies to cases where the original
        meshes of contact elements are located on a portion of a bolt-thread surface. This feature allows
        you to include the behavior of bolt threads without having to add the geometric detail of the
        threads. Calculations are performed internally to approximate the behavior of the bolt-thread
        connections.

        **Type: CONTACT, Subtype: BOLT**

        * Data to provide in the value fields for ``Subtype`` = BOLT:
        * ``D`` m, ``P``, ``ALPHA``, ``N``, ``X1``, ``Y1``, ``Z1``, ``X2``, ``Y2``, ``Z2``
        * where:
        * ``D`` m = Pitch diameter, d m.
        * ``P`` = Pitch distance, p.
        * ``ALPHA`` = Half-thread angle, α (defaults to 30 degrees).
        * ``N`` = Number of starts (defaults to 1).
        * ``X1``, ``Y1``, ``Z1``, ``X2``, ``Y2``, ``Z2`` = Two end points of the bolt axis in global
          Cartesian coordinates.

        .. _SECDATA_axisy:

        Type: AXIS
        General axisymmetric sections are referenced by the ``SURF159``, ``SOLID272``, and
        ``SOLID273``elements. Use this command to locate the axisymmetric axis.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * **Pattern 1 (two points):**
        * 1, ``X1``, ``Y1``, ``Z1``, ``X2``, ``Y2``, ``Z2``
        * where ``X1``, ``Y1``, ``Z1``, ``X2``, ``Y2``, ``Z2`` are global Cartesian coordinates.
        * **Pattern 2 (coordinate system number plus axis [1 = x, 2 = y, 3 = z] ):**
        * 2, ``csys``, ``axis``
        * where ``csys`` is a Cartesian coordinate system.
        * **Pattern 3 (origin plus direction):**
        * 3, ``XO``, ``YO``, ``ZO``, ``xdir``, ``ydir``, ``zdir``
        * where ``XO``, ``YO``, ``ZO``  ``are global Cartesian coordinates and xdir``, ``ydir``, and
          ``zdir`` are direction cosines.

        .. _SECDATA_joints:

        Type: JOINT
        Joint sections are referenced by ``MPC184``joint elements.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * ``length1``, ``length2``, ``length3``, ``angle1``, ``angle2``, ``angle3``
        * where:
        * ``length1-3`` = Reference lengths used in the constitutive calculations.
        * ``angle1-3`` = Reference angles used in the constitutive calculations.

        The following table shows the lengths and angles to be specified for different kinds of joints.

        InformalTables need to be added.
        The reference length and angle specifications correspond to the free relative degrees of freedom in
        a joint element for which constitutive calculations are performed. These values are used when
        stiffness and/or damping are specified for the joint elements.

        If the reference lengths and angles are not specified, they are calculated from the default or
        starting configuration for the element.

        See ``MPC184``or the individual joint element descriptions for more information on joint element
        constitutive calculations.

        .. _SECDATA_links:

        Type: LINK
        Link sections are referenced by the ``LINK33``, ``LINK180``and ``CABLE280``elements.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * ``VAL1`` = Area

        .. _SECDATA_pipes:

        Type: PIPE
        Pipe sections are referenced by the ``PIPE288``, ``PIPE289``, and ``ELBOW290``elements.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * ``D``  ``o``, ``T``  ``w``, ``N``  ``c``, ``S``  ``s``, ``N``  ``t``, ``M``  ``int``, ``M``
          ``ins``, ``T``  ``ins``
        * where:
        * ``D``  ``o``  = Outside diameter of pipe. Use a constant value for a circular pipe and an array
          for a noncircular pipe. (Noncircular pipe sections are referenced by the ``ELBOW290``element only.
          See `Defining a Noncircular Pipe
          <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_STR15_4.html#eq250dbbf7-3095-46cc-b4f3-1beb47c75a9c>`_
        * ``T``  ``w``  = Wall thickness. Default = ``D`` o / 2, or “solid” pipe. ("Solid" pipe is not
          applicable to ``ELBOW290``; for that element, a thickness less than ``D`` o / 4 is recommended.)
        * ``N``  ``c``  = Number of cells around the circumference (8 :math:````        ``N``  ``c``
          :math:````  120, where a greater value improves accuracy slightly; default =      8).
        * ``S``  ``s``  = Section number of the shell representing the pipe wall. Valid with
          ``ELBOW290``only. (Total thickness of the section is scaled to ``T``  ``w``. The program considers
          the innermost layer inside of the pipe to be the first layer.)
        * ``N``  ``t``  = Number of cells through the pipe wall. Valid values are 1 (default), 3, 5, 7, and
          9. Cells are graded such that they are thinner on the inner and outer surfaces. Valid with
          ``PIPE288``and ``PIPE289``only.
        * ``M``  ``int``  = Material number of fluid inside of the pipe. The default value is 0 (no fluid).
          This value is used to input the density of the internal fluid. The fluid inside the pipe element
          is ignored unless the free surface in a global X-Y plane is added as face 3 ( :ref:`sfe` ) and is
          high enough to include at least one end node of the element.
        * ``M``  ``ins``  = Material number of material external to the pipe (such as insulation or
          armoring). The default value is 0 (no external material). This value is used to input the density
          of the external material. (External material adds mass and increases hydraulic diameter, but does
          not add to stiffness.)
        * ``T``  ``ins``  = Thickness of material external to the pipe, such as insulation. The default
          value is 0 (no external material).

        The accuracy of the ovalization value (OVAL) output by ``ELBOW290``( `Structural Elbow
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_ELBOW290.html#elem290coordsys>`_
        form only) improves as the specified number of cells around the circumference ( ``N``  ``c``  ) is
        increased.

        External material ( ``M``  ``ins``  ) adds mass and increases hydraulic diameter, but does not add
        to stiffness.

        .. _SECDATA_pretension:

        Type: PRETENSION
        Pretension sections are referenced by the ``PRETS179``element.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * ``node``, ``nx``, ``ny``, ``nz``
        * where:
        * ``node`` = Pretension node number.
        * ``nx`` = Orientation in global Cartesian x direction.
        * ``ny`` = Orientation in global Cartesian y direction.
        * ``nz`` = Orientation in global Cartesian z direction.

        The following usage is typical:

        * SECTYPE, 1, PRETENSION
        * SECDATA, 13184, 0.000, 0.000, 1.000
        * SECMODIF, 1, NAME, example
        * SLOAD, 1, PL01, TINY, FORC, 100.00, 1, 2

        The ``PRETENSION`` section options of :ref:`sectype` and :ref:`secdata` are documented mainly to aid
        in the understanding of data written by :ref:`cdwrite`. Ansys, Inc. recommends that you
        generate pretension sections using :ref:`psmesh`.

        .. _SECDATA_reinforcement:

        Type: REINF
        Each :ref:`secdata` command defines the material, geometry, and orientation (if Subtype = SMEAR) of
        one reinforcing member (discrete fiber or smeared surface) in the section. The reinforcing section
        can be referenced by reinforcing elements ( ``REINF263``, ``REINF264``, and ``REINF265``), or
        ``MESH200``elements when used for temporarily representing reinforcing members. Only one
        :ref:`secdata` command is allowed per section when referenced by ``MESH200``elements. For more
        information, see `Element Embedding
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/str_compreinfdirectemb.html>`_

        **Type: REINF, Subtype: DISCRETE**

        Defines discrete reinforcing fibers with arbitrary orientations. For the MESH input pattern,
        reinforcing section data is referenced by ``MESH200``elements. For other patterns, issue separate
        :ref:`secdata` commands to define each reinforcing fiber.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * ``MAT, A, PATT, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5``
        * ``MAT`` = Material ID for the fiber. (See ``REINF264``for valid material models.) When the
          reinforcing section is referenced by a ``MESH200``element, the default is the ``MESH200``element
          material ID ( :ref:`mat` ). When the section is referenced by reinforcing elements, the material
          ID is required for all fibers, and no default for this value is available.
        * ``A`` = Cross-section area of the reinforcing fiber.
        * ``PATT`` = Input pattern code (described below) indicating how the location of this fiber is
          defined. Available input patterns are MESH (when the section is referenced by a
          ``MESH200``element), and LAYN, EDGO, and BEAM (when the section is referenced by a reinforcing
          element).
        * ``V1, V2, V3, V4, V5`` = Values to define the location of the reinforcing fiber (depending on the
          ``PATT`` pattern code used), as shown:

        **PATT: MESH**

        **Description:** The locations of reinforcing fibers are defined directly via ``MESH200``element
        connectivity.

        **Required input:**None.

        **PATT: LAYN**

        **Description:** The discrete reinforcing fiber is placed in the middle of a layer in a layered base
        element. The
        orientation of the fiber within the layer is adjustable via offsets with respect to a specified
        element edge.

        **Required input:**

        * ``V1`` (or ``N`` ) -- The number of the layer in the base element on which to apply the
          reinforcing fiber. The default value is 1.
        * ``V2`` (or ``e`` ) -- The number to indicate the element edge to which the offsets are measured.
          The default value is 1.
        * ``V3`` and ``V4`` (or ``Y1`` and ``Y2`` ) -- The normalized distances from the fiber to the two
          ends of the specified element edge. Valid values for ``Y1`` and ``Y2`` are 0.0 through 1.0. The
          default value of ``Y1`` is 0.5. The default value of ``Y2`` is ``Y1``.

        When applied to 8-node or 20-node layered solid elements:

        .. figure::../../../images/_commands/gSECD18.svg

        .. figure::../../../images/_commands/gSECD19.svg

        When applied to 4-node or 8-node layered shell elements:

        .. figure::../../../images/_commands/gSECD20.svg

        .. figure::../../../images/_commands/gSECD21.svg

        **PATT: EDGO**

        **Description:** The orientation of the discrete reinforcing fiber is similar to one of the
        specified element edges.
        The fiber orientation can be further adjusted via offsets with respect to the specified element
        edge.

        **Required input:**

        * ``V1`` (or ``O`` ) -- The number to indicate the element edge to which the offsets are measured.
          The default value is 1.
        * ``V2`` and ``V3`` (or ``Y1`` and ``Z1`` ) -- The normalized distances from the fiber to the first
          end of the specified element edge. Valid values for ``Y1`` and ``Z1`` are 0.0 through 1.0. The
          default value for ``Y1`` and ``Z1`` is 0.5.
        * ``V4`` and ``V5`` (or ``Y2`` and ``Z2`` ) - The normalized distances from the fiber to the second
          end of the specified element edge. Value values for ``Y2`` and ``Z2`` are 0.0 through 1.0. The
          default value for ``Y2`` is ``Y1``, and the default value for ``Z2`` is ``Z1``.

        If the base element is a beam or link, the program ignores values ``V2`` through ``V5`` and instead
        places the reinforcing in the center of the beam or link.

        When applied to 8-node or 20-node solid elements:

        When applied to beam or link elements:

        .. figure::../../../images/_commands/gSECD30.svg

        **PATT: BEAM**

        **Description:** Use this specialized input pattern for defining reinforcing in regular constant and
        tapered beams.

        **Required input:**

        * ``V1`` and ``V2`` (or ``Y1`` and ``Z1`` ) -- Y and Z offsets with respect to the section origin in
          the first beam section referenced by the base beam element. The default value for Y1 and Z1 is
          0.0.
        * ``V3`` and ``V4`` (or ``Y2`` and ``Z2`` ) -- Y and Z offsets with respect to the section origin in
          the second beam section referenced by the base beam element. The default value for ``Y2`` is
          ``Y1``, and the default value for ``Z2`` is ``Z1``. (Because ``V3`` and ``V4`` values apply only
          to tapered beams, the program ignores them if the base beam has a constant section.)

        **Type: REINF, Subtype: SMEAR**

        Suitable for layers of reinforcing fibers with uniform cross-section area and spacing. Each
        :ref:`secdata` command defines the one reinforcing layer in the section. When referenced by a
        ``MESH200``element, only one :ref:`secdata` command per section is allowed. When referenced by
        reinforcing elements ( ``REINF263``and ``REINF265``), this limitation does not apply.

        * Data to provide in the value fields:
        * ``MAT, A, S, KCN, THETA, PATT, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5``
        * where:
        * ``MAT`` = Material ID for layer. (See ``REINF263``or ``REINF265``for available material models.)
          When the section is referenced by a ``MESH200``element, the default is the ``MESH200``element
          material ID ( :ref:`mat` ). When the section is referenced by reinforcing elements, the material
          ID is required for all fibers, and no default for this value is available.
        * ``A`` = Cross-section area of a single reinforcing fiber ( or the thickness of the reinforcing
          layer for homogeneous reinforcing membranes).
        * ``S`` = Distance between two adjacent reinforcing fibers (ignored for homogeneous reinforcing
          membranes).
        * **Note:** If the section is used to model the reinforcing layers with a uniaxial stress state (
          :ref:`seccontrol`,,,0), the equivalent thickness h of the reinforcing layer is determined by h =
          ``A`` / ``S``, where ``A`` is the cross-section area of a single fiber and ``S`` is the distance
          between two adjacent fibers. If the section is used to model homogeneous reinforcing membranes (
          :ref:`seccontrol`,,,1), the cross-section area input ``A`` is the thickness of the reinforcing
          layer and the distance input ``S`` is ignored.
        * ``KCN`` = Local coordinate system reference number for this layer. (See :ref:`local` for more
          information.) When the section is referenced by a ``MESH200``element, the default ``KCN`` value is
          the ``MESH200``element coordinate system ID ( :ref:`esys` ). For the 2D smeared reinforcing
          element ``REINF263``, ``KCN`` input is not required. When ``KCN`` is not specified, the program
          uses a default layer coordinate system (described in ``REINF263``and ``REINF265``).
        * ``THETA`` = Angle (in degrees) of the final layer coordinate system with respect to the default
          layer system or the layer system specified in the ``KCN`` field. This value is ignored for
          ``REINF263``when that element is embedded in 2D plane strain or plane stress base elements.
        * ``PATT`` = Input pattern code (described below) indicating how the location of this fiber is
          defined. Available input patterns are MESH (when the section is referenced by a
          ``MESH200``element), and LAYN, EDGO, and BEAM (when the section is referenced by a reinforcing
          element).
        * ``V1, V2, V3, V4, V5`` = Values to define the location of the reinforcing layer, as shown:

        **PATT: MESH**

        **Description:** The locations of reinforcing fibers are defined directly via ``MESH200``element
        connectivity.

        **Required input:**None.

        **PATT: LAYN**

        **Description:** The smeared reinforcing layer is placed in the middle of a layer in a layered base
        element.

        **Required input:**``V1`` (or ``n`` ) -- The number of the layer in the base element on which to apply the reinforcing layer. The default value is 1.

        InformalTables need to be added.

        **PATT: EDGO**

        **Description:** This pattern applies only to 2D smeared reinforcing element ``REINF263``. The
        smeared reinforcing layer is represented by a line in 2D. The orientation of the 2D smeared
        reinforcing layer is similar to one of the specified element edges. The fiber orientation can be
        further adjusted via offsets with respect to the specified element edge.

        **Required input:**

        * ``V1`` (or ``O`` ) -- The number to indicate the element edge to which the offsets are measured.
          The default value is 1.
        * ``V2`` (or ``Y1`` ) -- The normalized distances from the reinforcing layer to the first end of the
          specified element edge. Valid values for Y1 are 0.0 through 1.0. The default value for ``Y1`` is
          0.5. ``V3`` (or ``Z1`` ) input is ignored.
        * ``V4`` (or ``Y2`` ) -- The normalized distances from the reinforcing layer to the second end of
          the specified element edge. Valid value values for ``Y2`` are 0.0 through 1.0. The default value
          for ``Y2`` is ``Y1``. ``V4`` (or ``Y2`` ) is ignored for axisymmetric shell elements. ``V5`` (or
          ``Z2``` ) input is ignored.

        InformalTables need to be added.

        **PATT: ELEF**

        **Description:** The smeared reinforcing layer is oriented parallel to one of three adjacent element
        faces. (This
        pattern does not apply to 2D smeared reinforcing element ``REINF263``.)

        **Required input:**

        * ``V1`` (or ``F`` ) -- The number to indicate the base element face. The default value is 1.
        * ``V2`` (or ``d1`` ) -- The normalized distance from the layer to the specified base element face.
          Valid values for ``d1`` are 0.0 through 1.0. The default value is 0.5.
        * ``V3`` (or ``d2`` ) -- The normalized distance from corners JJ and KK of the layer to the
          specified base element face (applicable to 8-node or 20-node solid elements only). Valid values
          for ``d2`` are 0.0 through 1.0. The default value is ``d1``.

        Notes

        .. _SECFUNCTION_notes:

        The :ref:`secfunction` command is associated with the section most recently defined via the
        :ref:`sectype` command.

        A table parameter can define tabular thickness as a function of coordinates. Alternatively, you can
        use an array parameter (indexed by node number) that expresses the function to be mapped. (See
        ``PATTERN`` of NOD2 for array content.) Enclose the table or array name in percent signs (%) (
        :ref:`secfunction`,``%tablename%``).

        Issue the :ref:`dim` command to define a table or array.

        The table or array defines the total shell thickness at any point in space. In multilayered
        sections, the total thickness and each layer thickness are scaled accordingly.

        The `Function Tool
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BASFUNCGRAPH.html>`_ is a
        convenient way to define your thickness tables.

        Refer to the :ref:`dim` command for interpreting a table in a local coordinate system.

        When ``PATTERN`` = NODE, ``TABLE`` should be a 1D array parameter (indexed by node number) that
        expresses the function to be mapped.

        When ``PATTERN`` = NOD2, ``TABLE`` should be a 2D array parameter (where column 1 contains node
        numbers and column 2 contains the corresponding thicknesses) that expresses the function to be
        mapped.

        Specify ``PATTERN`` when ``TABLE`` is an array parameter only (and not when it is a table parameter
        or a single value).

        The :ref:`secoffset` command is divided into four types: `Beams

        General Shells. <SECOFFSET_preintshells>`

        The offsets defined by the :ref:`secoffset` command are associated with the section most recently
        defined using the :ref:`sectype` command. Not all :ref:`secoffset` location values are valid for
        each subtype.

        For the thermal shell elements, ``SHELL131``and ``SHELL132``, the node offset specified by
        :ref:`secoffset` is used in thermal contact analyses. Otherwise, the :ref:`secoffset` command has no
        effect on the solution for these elements and is used only for visualization purposes.

        This command is not valid with thermal solid elements ``SOLID278``and ``SOLID279``.

        For beam elements ``BEAM188``/ ``BEAM189``and pipe elements ``PIPE288``/ ``PIPE289``in the XY plane,
        an offset is not allowed if it causes the elements to be nonsymmetric about the XY plane.

          * ``USER`` - Beam node will be offset to the location specified by ``OFFSETY`` and ``OFFSETZ``.

        * ``OFFSETY, OFFSETZ`` - Values that locate the node with respect to the default origin of the
          cross section when the ``Location`` argument is set to USER. Valid only when USER is set.

          The following figure illustrates the offsets for a channel cross section, and shows the relative
          locations of SHRC and CENT.

          * ``MID`` - Shell node will be offset to midplane of the section (default).

          * ``BOT`` - Shell node will be offset to bottom of the section.

          * ``USER`` - Shell node will be offset to the location specified by ``OFFSET``.

        * ``OFFSET`` - Value that locates the node with respect to the default origin (midplane) of the
          section. Valid only when ``Location`` = USER.

          The offset alters only the reference surface of the shell elements (that is, where the nodes are
          located). It does not change the physical dimensions of the shell itself; the volume and mass remain
          constant when an offset is specified.

        Use this command to define additional section data for ``MPC184``joint elements. To overwrite the
        current values, issue another :ref:`secjoint` command with the same ``Kywrd`` value. The data input
        on this command is interpreted based on the most recently issued :ref:`sectype` command.

        The command :ref:`secjoint`,PNLT is only applicable to penalty-based joints (KEYOPT(2) = 1 on most
        joint elements). The default penalty factor (common to all constraints of the joint element) is of
        the order of 10\*E avg, where E avg is the average Young``s modulus of the elements attached to the
        joint element or deduced from the connections to other elements. The default value may be overridden
        by specifying user-defined penalty factors via :ref:`secjoint`,PNLT. The choice of penalty factors
        can affect the constraint satisfaction as well as overall solution convergence.

          states.) For structural-reinforcing analysis, the base-element material consists of mass,
          stiffness, and body force. For thermal-reinforcing analysis, the base-element material consists of
          damping, conduction, and heat generation, and the base-element surface loads (convection and heat
          flux) are not subtracted. This option is not valid when the base-element material is anisotropic.
        * For smeared reinforcing with ``STSSTATE`` = 0, the equivalent thickness h of the smeared
          reinforcing layer is determined by h = ``A`` / ``S``, where ``A`` is the cross-section area of a
          single fiber and ``S`` is the distance between two adjacent fibers. (See :ref:`secdata`.)
        * ``STSSTATE`` = 1 to 3 is suitable for homogenous reinforcing layers (membrane) and applies to
          smeared reinforcing only ( :ref:`sectype`,,REINF,SMEAR). For smeared reinforcing with ``STSSTATE``
          = 1 to 3, discrete reinforcing with ``STSSTATE`` = 1, ``TENSKEY`` is ignored, and the default
          tension and compression behaviors apply to the reinforcing layers; also, the cross-section area
          input ``A`` is the thickness of the reinforcing layers and the distance input ``S`` is ignored.
          (See :ref:`secdata` and `REINF265 Structural/Thermal Input Data
          <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_REINF265.html#reinf265inpsummary>`_
        * For discrete reinforcing with ``STSSTATE`` = 1 or smeared reinforcing with ``STSSTATE`` = 3,
          bending or torsional reinforcing stiffness may not be captured adequately when using reinforcing
          with overly refined high-order base tetrahedral elements ( ``SOLID187``or degenerated
          ``SOLID186``) and the stiffness ratio between reinforcing and base elements is excessive (> 100x).
        * Specified ``TENSKEY``, ``REMBASE`` and ``STSSTATE`` values apply to all fibers defined in the
          current section.

        If the coefficients ``B`` 12, ``B`` 13, ``B`` 23 are undefined, the program uses a symmetric form of
        submatrix [ **B** ]. If any one of the coefficients ``B`` 12, ``B`` 13, ``B`` 23 is nonzero, the

            Determines the content of the summarized information for beam, pipe, shell, and reinforcing
            sections.

            * ``BRIEF`` - For beams, lists only the section integrated properties (such as Area, Iyy, and Iyz ).
              This option is the default.

              and input fiber location parameters).

            * ``FULL`` - For beams, lists the section integrated properties, as well as the section nodal
              coordinates, section cell connectivity information, and section cell integration point coordinates.
              For shells, the section stiffness (membrane, bending, membrane-bending coupling and transverse
              shear) are printed.

              The shell section stiffness listed considers elastic behavior of materials at reference temperature

              accounts for section offsets during the solution phase of the analysis.

              reinforcing fibers or surfaces (including material ID, cross-section area, fiber spacing,
              orientation, and locations in natural coordinates). For predefined section reinforcing used by the

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SECTYPE_notes:

        :ref:`sectype` sets the section ID number, section type, and subtype for a section. A previously-
        defined section with the same identification number will be redefined. The geometry data describing
        this section type is defined by a subsequent :ref:`secdata` command. Define the offsets (if
        applicable) by a subsequent :ref:`secoffset` command. The :ref:`slist` command lists the section
        properties, and the :ref:`secplot` command displays the section to scale. The :ref:`secnum` command
        assigns the section ID number to any subsequently-defined elements.

        When defining a section for contact elements ( ``Type`` = CONTACT) that are used in a `general
        contact <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_ctec/ctec_toolsgencont.html>`_
        definition, a section number representing a general contact surface can be specified. Alternatively,
        you may define a subset of a region by inputting a valid label for ``SECID`` (ALL_EDGE, ALL_FACE,
        ALL_VERT, ALL_TOP,or ALL_BOT), or by inputting a node component name with or without a component
        name extension (_EDGE, _FACE, _VERT, _TOP, or _BOT). For more information, see in the `Contact
        Technology Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_ctec/ctec_flpressexamp.html>`_.

        For a beam section ( ``Type`` = BEAM), a subsequent :ref:`secdata` command builds a numeric model
        using a nine-node cell for determining the properties ( ``Ixx``, ``Iyy``, etc.) of the section and
        for the solution to the Poisson's equation for torsional behavior. See `Beam Analysisand Cross
        Sections <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_STR15_6.html>`_ in

        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_STRNGBS.html#strngbscons>`_ (
        ``Type`` = GENB), the ``Subtype`` and ``REFINEKEY`` options do not apply. Subsequent commands are
        necessary to define the section: :ref:`bsax`, :ref:`bsm1`, :ref:`bsm2`, :ref:`bstq`, :ref:`bss1`,
        :ref:`bss2`, :ref:`bsmd`, and :ref:`bste` are available. All other section commands are ignored for
        this section type.

        For a `preintegrated composite-beam section
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_PREBEAMSECT_5.html#>`_ (
        ``Type`` = COMB), the ``REFINEKEY`` options do not apply. Subsequent commands are necessary to
        define the section: :ref:`cbtmp`, :ref:`cbmx`, :ref:`cbmd`, and :ref:`cbte` are available. All other
        section commands are ignored for this section type.

        For a `taperedbeam or pipe section
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_STR15_4.html#>`_ ( ``Type`` =
        TAPER), two subsequent :ref:`secdata` commands are required (one for each end section). Section ends
        must be topologically identical (same ``Subtype``, number of cells and material IDs). For a tapered
        pipe section, end sections must have the same number of cells around the circumference and along the
        pipe wall, and the same shell section ID for a composite pipe wall.

        For a `preintegratedgeneral shell section
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_PRESHELL_5.html#strpreshcons>`_
        ( ``Type`` = GENS), the ``Subtype`` and ``REFINEKEY`` options do not apply. Subsequent commands are
        necessary to define the section: :ref:`sspa`, :ref:`sspb`, :ref:`sspd`, :ref:`sspe`, :ref:`ssmt`,
        :ref:`ssbt`, and :ref:`sspm` are available. All other section commands are ignored for this section
        type.

        The PRETENSION section options of the :ref:`sectype` and :ref:`secdata` commands are documented
        primarily to aid your understanding of the data written by the :ref:`cdwrite` command.
        Ansys, Inc. recommends that you generate pretension sections via the :ref:`psmesh` command.

        For a reinforcing section ( ``Type`` = REINF), each subsequent :ref:`secdata` command defines the
        material, geometry, and orientation of one discrete reinforcing fiber ( ``Subtype`` = DISC) or one
        smeared reinforcing surface ( ``Subtype`` = SMEAR). When referenced by a ``MESH200``element, only
        one :ref:`secdata` command is valid.

        A subsequent :ref:`secdata` command defines the geometry data describing this section type.

        To display elements with shapes determined from the section definition, issue the :ref:`eshape`
        command.

        which to apply the ``FDVALUE``.

        No default exists for the ``LSLOCK`` locked load step value. You must specify the load step in which
        to lock the ``FDVALUE``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        secid : str
            Unique section number. The number must already be assigned to a pretension section.

        plnlab : str
            Label representing the pretension load sequence number in the format "PL ``nn`` " where ``nn``
            is an integer from 1 through 99 (for example, PL01 through PL99).

            Specify a value of DELETE to delete all loads on the specified pretension section ( ``SECID`` ).
            In this case, the command ignores any other argument values.

        kinit : str
            Initial action key for pretension load PL01. (This field is omitted for PL02 and up.) Three
            scenarios are possible:

            * ``LOCK`` - Constrains (connects) the cutting plane on the pretension section. This value is the
              default.

            * ``SLID`` - Unconstrains (disconnects) the cutting plane on the pretension section.

            * ``TINY`` - Applies a very small pretension load (0.1% of ``FDVALUE`` ) before the desired load is
              established. The small load prevents convergence problems which can occur when the desired load is
              not established in the first load step. This value is valid only if ``KFD`` = FORC.

        kfd : str
            Force/Displacement key. Specifies whether ``FDVALUE`` is a force or a displacement:

            * ``FORC`` - Apply a force on the specified pretension section. This value is the default.

            * ``DISP`` - Apply a displacement (adjustment) on the specified pretension section.

        fdvalue : str
            Pretension load value. If ``KFD`` = FORC, this value is a pretension force. If ``KFD`` = DISP,
            this value is a pretension displacement (adjustment).

        lsload : str
            Load step in which to apply the ``FDVALUE``.

        lslock : str
            The load step in which the displacement value resulting from the pretension force is locked.
            This value is valid only if ``KFD`` = FORC.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SLOAD_notes:

        The :ref:`sload` command applies pretension loads to specified pretension sections (
        ``PRETS179``-based) created via the :ref:`psmesh` command. A pretension load is ramp-applied (
        :ref:`kbc` = 0) if it is a force ( ``KFD`` = FORC), and step-applied ( :ref:`kbc` = 1) if it is a
        displacement ( ``KFD`` = DISP).

        You can lock the load value at a specified load step. When locked, the load changes from a force to
        a displacement, and the program applies the load as a constant displacement in all future load
        steps. Locking is useful when applying additional loadings. The additional loadings alter the effect
        of the initial load value, but because locking transforms the load into a displacement, it preserves
        the initial load's effect.

        In modal and harmonic analyses, any pretension load (force, displacement, or locked) is ignored and
        no load is produced.

        The :ref:`sload` command is not valid for ``MPC184``-based preload sections created with
        :ref:`psmesh`.

          **Example: Applying a Load**

          The following command shows how to establish loads on a pretension section:

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,1,PL01,TINY,FORC,5000,2,3

          In this example, the load is applied to pretension section

          .. code:: apdl

             1

         , and the sequence begins with the initial action key, ``KINIT``, set to ``TINY``. A small
          stabilization load (5 = 0.10% of 5000) is applied in the first load step, as the actual pretension
          force is not applied until the second load step. The next four fields set the actual load: the
          ``KFD`` value ``FORC`` specifies the type of load, ``FDVALUE`` defines the pretension load value (
          ``5000`` ), ``LSLOAD`` specifies the load step in which the force is applied ( ``2`` ), and the
          ``LSLOCK`` field specifies the load step in which the force is locked ( ``3`` ). Additional sets of
          four fields can be used to define additional loads.

          **Example: Editing an Existing Load**

          You can use the :ref:`sload` command to edit (overwrite) existing loads on a pretension section.
          This example changes the load on pretension section 1 (set above) to 6000:

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,1,PL01,,,6000,2,3

          Unspecified values (blank fields), as shown in this example, remain unchanged from prior settings.
          If no prior specifications exist, then default values ( ``KINIT`` = LOCK and ``KFD`` = FORC) apply.

          **Example: Deleting All Loads**

          The command can also delete all loads on a specified pretension section, as shown here:

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,1,DELETE

          **Example: Locking a Pretension Element**

          For a prestressed modal analysis, this command locks the pretension element:

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,1,PL01,LOCK,DISP,0,1,2

        **Multiple Loadings**
        The :ref:`sload` command allows you to apply multiple loadings. You can add up to 15 loadings (PL01
        through PL15), or delete loadings, for any given pretension section(s).

          **Example: Applying Multiple Loadings**

          The following :ref:`sload` commands, issued in the order shown, establish a pretension load sequence
          in pretension section 2 with a force of 25 in load step (LS) 2, locked in LS 3-6, a force of 50 in
          LS 7, locked in LS 8-11, a force of 75 in LS 12, locked in LS 13 and beyond:

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,2,PL01,LOCK,FORC,25,2,3

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,2,PL02,,FORC,50,7,8

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,2,PL03,,FORC,75,12,13

          At the same time, you can issue SLOAD commands to apply loads on other pretension sections. For
          example, in addition to the commands listed above, you could issue the following command to apply a
          load on pretension section 3:

          .. code:: apdl

             SLOAD,3,PL01,LOCK,FORC,25,3,4

        Any addition or deletion of a loading applies to the selected sections only. Mechanical APDL does
        not apply
        or delete a load until you click the Apply or OK button.

        After you have successfully solved for a specified ``LSLOAD`` (GUI field Apply at LS ) and
        eventually ``LSLOCK`` (GUI field Lock at LS ) value, you cannot modify that loading's settings
        during subsequent steps of the analysis. Similarly, you cannot delete loadings that you have already

        .. _SFLEX_notes:

        The :ref:`sflex` command sets section-flexibility factors for sections used by pipe elements.

        To increase stiffness, use a flexibility factor of less than 1.0.

        The ``FFBY`` and ``FFTSY`` arguments affect motion in the element x-z plane, and the ``FFBZ`` and
        ``FFTSZ`` arguments affect motion in the element x-y plane. For stout pipe structures with low
        slenderness ratios, set both FFBY and FFTSY--and/or both FFBZ and FFTSZ (the related bending and
        transverse shear factors)--to the same value to obtain the expected flexibility effect.

        When issued, the :ref:`sflex` command applies to the pipe section most recently defined via the
        :ref:`sectype` command.

        :ref:`sflex` is valid only for linear material properties and small strain analyses. The command
        does not support offsets, temperature loading, or initial state loading. While the resulting
        displacements and reactions are valid, the stresses may not be valid.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `SECREAD <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SECREAD.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            Section library file name and directory path containing the section library file (248 characters
            maximum, including directory). If you do not specify a directory path, it will default to your
            working directory and you can use all 248 characters for the file name.

            When the :ref:`secread` command is given without a directory path, the command searches for a section library in the following order:

            * The user's home directory

            * The current working directory

            * The path specified by the :ref:`seclib` command

            The file name defaults to :file:`Jobname` if ``Fname`` is left blank.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). The extension defaults to SECT if ``Ext`` is left
            blank.

        option : str

            * ``LIBRARY`` - Reads in a library of sections and their associated section data values; the
              default. A section library may be created by editing the section-defining portions of the
              :file:`Jobname.LOG` file and saving it with a :file:`.SECT` suffix.

            * ``MESH`` - Reads in a user mesh section file containing the cell connectivity, cell flags, and
              nodal coordinates for the current beam section of subtype MESH as defined by :ref:`sectype`. See the
              :ref:`SECREAD.notes`section of this command description for details about user mesh section files.

        .. _SECREAD_notes:

        The :ref:`secread` command operates on the section specified via the most recently issued
        **SECTYPE** command. Issue a separate :ref:`secread` command for each section ID that you want to
        read in.

        .. _SECREAD_extranote1:

        Here are excerpts from a sample user section mesh file for a section with 75 nodes, 13 cells, and 9
        nodes per cell for a two-hole box section. Illustrations of the two-hole box section and the cell
        mesh for it appear later in this command description.

        InformalTables need to be added.
        The mesh file is divided into three sections: the First Line, the Cells Section, and the Nodes
        Section. Here are brief descriptions of the contents of each.

        **First Line:** The First Line defines the number of nodes and the number of cells for the mesh.

        **Cells Section:** The Cells Section contains as many lines as there are cells. In this example,
        there are thirteen
        cells, so there are thirteen lines in this section. In each line, the number "1" that follows the
        cell connectivity information is the material number.

        Cell nodal connectivity must be given in a counterclockwise direction, with the center node being
        the ninth node. For details, see :ref:`secread.fig.2`.

        **Nodes Section:** The Nodes Section contains as many lines as there are nodes. In this example,
        there are 75 nodes, so
        there are a total of 75 lines in this section. Each node line contains the node's boundary flag, the
        Y coordinate of the node, and the Z coordinate of the node. Currently, all node boundary flags
        appear as 0s in a cell mesh file (as illustrated in :ref:`secread.fig.1`). Since all node boundary
        flags are 0, :ref:`secread` ignores them when it reads a cell mesh file into Mechanical APDL.

        There cannot be any gaps in the node numbering of a cell mesh. The nodes in a cell mesh must be
        numbered consecutively, with the first node having a node number of 1, and the last node having a
        node number that is equal to the maximum number of nodes in the cell mesh.
