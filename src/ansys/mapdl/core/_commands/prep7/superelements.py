        Mechanical APDL Command: `SETRAN <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SETRAN.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        sename : str
            The name (case-sensitive) of the file containing the original superelement matrix created by the
            generation pass ( :file:`Sename.SUB` ). The default is the current :file:`Jobname`. If
            ``Sename`` is a number, it is the element number of a previously defined superelement in the
            current use pass.

        kcnto : str
            The reference number of the coordinate system to where the superelement is to be transferred.
            The default is the global Cartesian system. Transfer occurs from the active coordinate system.

        inc : str
            The node offset. The default is zero. All new element node numbers are offset from those on the
            original by ``INC``.

        file : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. This field requires input.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). The extension defaults to SUB.

        dx : str
            Node location increments in the global Cartesian coordinate system. Defaults to zero.

        dy : str
            Node location increments in the global Cartesian coordinate system. Defaults to zero.

        dz : str
            Node location increments in the global Cartesian coordinate system. Defaults to zero.

        norot : int or str
            Node rotation :ref:`key: <NOROTnotes>`

            * ``0`` - The nodal coordinate systems of the transferred superelement rotate into the ``KCNTO``
              system. (That is, the nodal coordinate systems rotate with the superelement.) The superelement
              matrices remain unchanged. This value is the default.

            * ``1`` - The nodal coordinate systems do not rotate. (That is, they remain fixed in their original
              global orientation.) The superelement matrices and load vectors are modified if any rotations occur.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SETRAN_notes:

        The :ref:`setran` command creates a superelement from an existing superelement and writes the new
        element to a file. You can then issue an :ref:`se` command to read the new element (during the `use
        pass
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_substr/an9Auq1d6ldm.html#advobsl5jla062999>`_
        ).

        You can create a superelement from an original by:

        * Transferring the original's geometry from the active coordinate system into another coordinate
          system ( ``KCNTO`` )

        * Offsetting its geometry in the global Cartesian coordinate system ( ``DX``, ``DY``, and ``DZ`` )

        * Offsetting its node numbers ( ``INC`` ).

        A combination of methods is valid. If you specify both the geometry transfer and the geometry
        offset, the transfer occurs first.

         .. _NOROTnotes:

         If you specify rotation of the transferred superelement's nodal coordinate systems into the
        ``KCNTO`` system ( ``NOROT`` = 0), the rotated nodes cannot be coupled via the :ref:`cp` command; in
        this case, issue the :ref:`ce` command instead. If you specify no rotation of the nodal coordinate
        systems ( ``NOROT`` = 1) for models with displacement degrees of freedom, and ``KCNTO`` is not the
        active system, the superelement ``Sename`` must have six MDOF at each node that has MDOF; therefore,
        only elements with all six structural DOFs are valid in such cases.

        There is no limit to the number of copies that can be made of a superelement, provided the copies
        are all generated from the same original superelement. However, nested copies are limited to five.
        In other words, the total number of different ``Sename`` usages on the :ref:`setran` and
        :ref:`sesymm` commands is limited to five.

        This command is not supported if the original superelement matrix was created in a component mode
        synthesis analysis generation pass with the element results calculation activated ( ``Elcalc`` = YES
        on :ref:`cmsopt` ).

        ncomp : str
            Symmetry key:

            * ``Y`` - Y symmetry.

            * ``Z`` - Z symmetry.

        inc : str
            Increment all nodes in the superelement by ``INC``.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SESYMM_notes:

        Performs a symmetry operation on a superelement within the substructure use pass by reversing the
        sign of component ``Ncomp`` in the global Cartesian coordinate system. The node numbers are
        incremented by ``INC``. The new superelement is written to :file:`File.SUB` in the current directory
        (by default). All master node nodal coordinate systems must be global Cartesian (no rotated nodes
        allowed).

        The maximum number of transformations for a given superelement is five (including :ref:`setran`,
        :ref:`sesymm`, and the large rotation transformation if :ref:`nlgeom` is ON in the use pass).

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : str
            The name (case sensitive) of the file containing the original superelement matrix created by the
            generation pass ( :file:`Sename.SUB` ). The default is the current Jobname.

        toler : str
            Tolerance used to determine if use pass nodes are noncoincident with master nodes having the
            same node numbers. Defaults to 0.0001. Use pass nodes will always be replaced by master nodes of
            the same node number. However, if a use pass node is more than ``TOLER`` away from the
            corresponding master node, a warning is generated.

        nstartvn : str
            Node number to be assigned to the first virtual node created to store the generalized
            coordinates in a component mode synthesis analysis. See :ref:`SE.notes`for more information.

        Defines a superelement by reading in the superelement matrices and master nodes from the
        superelement matrix file. The matrix file ( :file:`File.SUB` ) must be available from the
        substructure generation pass. The proper element type ( ``MATRIX50``) must be active ( :ref:`type` )
        for this command. A scratch file called :file:`File.SORD` showing the superelement names and their
        corresponding element numbers is also written.

        ``nStartVN`` should be chosen so as to offset the virtual node numbers from the other node numbers
        used in the model. Otherwise, ``nStartVN`` is internally set by the program to fulfill that
        condition. The node number defined through ``nStartVN`` is considered only if applied on the first
        issued :ref:`se` command. ``nStartVN`` can also be defined during the generation pass using the
        :ref:`cmsopt` command. If ``nStartVN`` is defined on both :ref:`cmsopt` and :ref:`se` commands, the
        larger number prevails.
