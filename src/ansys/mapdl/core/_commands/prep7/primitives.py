        by the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and appears in the log file ( :file:`Jobname.LOG` ) if
        graphical picking is used.

        This command is not intended to be typed in directly in a Mechanical APDL session (although it can
        be
        included in an input file for batch input or for use with :ref:`input` ).

        For polygons, :ref:`pri2` appears in the log file as :ref:`pri2`, ``P51X``,0.0,0.0, preceded by
        :ref:`fitem` commands defining the vertices (in global Cartesian coordinates).

        Parameters
        ----------
        rad1 : str
            Three values that define the radii of the torus. You can specify the radii in any order. The
            smallest of the values is the inner minor radius, the intermediate value is the outer minor
            radius, and the largest value is the major radius. (There is one exception regarding the order
            of the radii values--if you want to create a solid torus, specify zero or blank for the inner
            minor radius, in which case the zero or blank must occupy either the ``RAD1`` or ``RAD2``
            position.) At least two of the values that you specify must be positive values; they will be
            used to define the outer minor radius and the major radius. See the diagram in the Notes section
            for a view of a toroidal sector showing all radii.

        rad2 : str
            Three values that define the radii of the torus. You can specify the radii in any order. The
            smallest of the values is the inner minor radius, the intermediate value is the outer minor
            radius, and the largest value is the major radius. (There is one exception regarding the order
            of the radii values--if you want to create a solid torus, specify zero or blank for the inner
            minor radius, in which case the zero or blank must occupy either the ``RAD1`` or ``RAD2``

            Three values that define the radii of the torus. You can specify the radii in any order. The
            smallest of the values is the inner minor radius, the intermediate value is the outer minor
            radius, and the largest value is the major radius. (There is one exception regarding the order
            of the radii values--if you want to create a solid torus, specify zero or blank for the inner

        theta1 : str
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the torus. Used for creating a toroidal sector. The
            sector begins at the algebraically smaller angle, extends in a positive angular direction, and
            ends at the larger angle. The starting angle defaults to 0° and the ending angle defaults to
            360°.

        theta2 : str
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the torus. Used for creating a toroidal sector. The
            sector begins at the algebraically smaller angle, extends in a positive angular direction, and

        To create the toroidal sector shown below, the command :ref:`torus`,5,1,2,0,180 was issued. Since
        "1" was the smallest radii value specified, it defined the inner minor radius; since "2" was the

        radii value specified, it defined the major radius. The values "0" and "180" defined the starting

        Parameters
        ----------
        rbot : str
            Radii of the bottom and top faces of the cone. A value of zero or blank for either ``RBOT`` or
            ``RTOP`` defines a degenerate face at the center axis (that is, the vertex of the cone). The
            same value for both ``RBOT`` and ``RTOP`` defines a cylinder instead of a cone.

        rtop : str
            Radii of the bottom and top faces of the cone. A value of zero or blank for either ``RBOT`` or
            ``RTOP`` defines a degenerate face at the center axis (that is, the vertex of the cone). The
            same value for both ``RBOT`` and ``RTOP`` defines a cylinder instead of a cone.

        z1 : str
            Working plane Z coordinates of the cone. The smaller value is always associated with the bottom
            face.

        z2 : str
            Working plane Z coordinates of the cone. The smaller value is always associated with the bottom
            face.

        theta1 : str
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the cone. Used for creating a conical sector. The
            sector begins at the algebraically smaller angle, extends in a positive angular direction, and
            ends at the larger angle. The starting angle defaults to 0° and the ending angle defaults to
            360°. See the `Modeling and Meshing Guide
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_mod/Hlp_G_MOD14.html>`_ for an
            illustration.

        theta2 : str
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the cone. Used for creating a conical sector. The
            sector begins at the algebraically smaller angle, extends in a positive angular direction, and

        height : str
            The total distance on or parallel to the working plane Y-axis defining the height of the

        depth : str
            The perpendicular distance (either positive or negative based on the working plane Z direction)
            from the working plane representing the depth of the block. If ``DEPTH`` = 0 (default), a

        Parameters
        ----------
        rad1 : str
            Inner and outer radii (either order) of the sphere. A value of zero or blank for either ``RAD1``
            or ``RAD2`` defines a solid sphere.

        rad2 : str
            Inner and outer radii (either order) of the sphere. A value of zero or blank for either ``RAD1``
            or ``RAD2`` defines a solid sphere.

        theta1 : str
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the sphere. Used for creating a spherical sector.
            The sector begins at the algebraically smaller angle, extends in a positive angular direction,
            and ends at the larger angle. The starting angle defaults to 0.0° and the ending angle defaults
            to 360.0°. See the `Modeling and Meshing Guide
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_mod/Hlp_G_MOD14.html>`_ for an
            illustration.

        theta2 : str
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the sphere. Used for creating a spherical sector.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Volume number of the sphere.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SPHERE_notes:

        Defines either a solid or hollow sphere or spherical sector centered about the working plane origin.
        The sphere must have a spatial volume greater than zero. (that is, this volume primitive command
        cannot be used to create a degenerate volume as a means of creating an area.) Inaccuracies can
        develop when the size of the object you create is much smaller than the relative coordinate system
        values (ratios near to or greater than 1000). If you require an exceptionally small sphere, create a
        larger object, and scale it down to the appropriate size.

        For a solid sphere of 360°, you define it with two areas, each consisting of a hemisphere. See the
        :ref:`sph4` and :ref:`sph5` commands for the other ways to create spheres.

            or ``RAD2`` defines a solid sphere.

        Returns

            Volume number of the sphere.

        .. _SPH4_notes:

        Defines either a solid or hollow spherical volume anywhere on the working plane. The sphere must
        have a spatial volume greater than zero. (that is, this volume primitive command cannot be used to
        create a degenerate volume as a means of creating an area.) A sphere of 360° will be defined with
        two areas, each consisting of a hemisphere. See the :ref:`sphere` and :ref:`sph5` commands for other
