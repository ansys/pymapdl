        Notes
        -----

        .. _PMLOPT_notes:

        The :ref:`pmlopt` command can be used to define perfectly matched layers (PML). The following
        element types support perfectly matched layers:

        * Acoustic elements: ``FLUID30``, ``FLUID220``, and ``FLUID221`` (KEYOPT(4) > 0) in a modal,
          harmonic, or transient acoustic analysis.

        * Piezoelectric coupled-field elements: ``PLANE222``, ``PLANE223``, ``SOLID225``, ``SOLID226``, and
          ``SOLID227`` (KEYOPT(15) = 1) in a harmonic piezoelectric analysis. For the lower order elements (
          ``PLANE222`` and ``SOLID225`` ), PML is only supported with the B-bar method.

        * Structural elements: ``PLANE182``, ``PLANE183``, ``SOLID185``, ``SOLID186``, and ``SOLID187``
          (KEYOPT(15) = 1) in a linear static or harmonic structural analysis. For the lower order elements
          ( ``PLANE182`` and ``SOLID185`` ), PML is only supported with the B-bar method.

        Each PML region must have a uniquely defined PML element coordinate system ( :ref:`psys` ). Normal
        reflection coefficient values for a harmonic analysis must be less than 1.

        The :ref:`pmlopt` command can also be used to define irregular perfectly matched layers (IPML) for
        acoustic analyses. Normal reflection coefficient values for a harmonic analysis must be less than 1.

        Issue :ref:`pmlopt`,STAT to list the current normal reflection coefficient or attenuation factor
        settings for a PML or IPML region. Issue :ref:`pmlopt`,CLEAR to clear all normal reflection
        coefficient settings and restore them to the defaults.

        Issue :ref:`pmlopt`,PSYS,CLEAR to clear all normal reflection coefficient settings for the specified
        PML element coordinate system and restore them to the defaults.

        For modal analysis, use one buffer element between the PML and the resonant structure to avoid the
        spurious modes. The mode patterns should be evaluated graphically.

        :ref:`pmlsize` determines the number of PML or IPML layers for acceptable numerical accuracy.

        :ref:`pmlsize` must be issued before any meshing commands. If the thickness of the PML or IPML
