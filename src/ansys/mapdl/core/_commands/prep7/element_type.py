        .. _DOF_notes:

        The degree of freedom (DOF) set for the model is determined from all element types defined. This
        command may be used to add to the current set. The ALL label may be used on some commands to
        represent all labels of the current degree of freedom set for the model. Issue the :ref:`dof`
        command with no arguments to list the current set. Use the DELETE label to delete any previously
        added DOFs and return to the default DOF set.

        inopr : str
            Specify 1 to suppress all element-solution printout for this element type.

        Notes
        -----
        The ET command selects an element type from the element
        library and establishes it as a local element type for the
        current model.  Information derived from the element type is
        used for subsequent commands, so the ET command(s) should be
        issued early. (The Element Reference describes the available
        elements.)

        A special option, ``ename=0``, permits the specified element
        type to be ignored during solution without actually removing
        the element from the model. Ename may be set to zero only
        after the element type has been previously defined with a
        nonzero Ename.  The preferred method of ignoring elements is
        to use the select commands (such as ESEL).

        KOPn are element option keys. These keys (referred to as
        KEYOPT(n)) are used to turn on certain element options for
        this element. These options are listed under "KEYOPT" in the
        input table for each element type in the Element Reference.
        KEYOPT values include stiffness formulation options, printout
        controls, and various other element options. If KEYOPT(7) or
        greater is needed, input their values with the KEYOPT command.

        The ET command only defines an element type local to your
        model (from the types in the element library). The TYPE or
        similar [KATT, LATT, AATT, or VATT] command must be used to
        point to the desired local element type before meshing.

        To activate the ANSYS program's LS-DYNA explicit dynamic
        analysis capability, use the ET command
        to choose an element that works only with LS-DYNA (such as
        SHELL163).

        Examples
        --------
        Define an element type.  Allow MAPDL to pick your the element
        type.

        >>> etype_num = mapdl.et('', 'SURF154')
        >>> etype_num
        1

        Define an element type while specifying the element type
        number.

        Changes the currently defined element types to their corresponding types. Elements without a
        companion element (listed above) are not switched and should be switched with the :ref:`et` command
        to an appropriate element type or to a null element. The KEYOPT values for the switched element
        types are reset to zero or to their default values. You must check these values to see if they are
        still meaningful. Additionally, if ``Cnv`` = ETI, ITE, or TTE, all real constants are set to zero.

        If ``Cnv`` = ITE, you will need to choose a material model that corresponds to your previously-
        defined material properties. If working interactively, the application prompts you to do so.

              automatically. This action overrides any previous manual settings.

            * ``OFF`` - Deactivates automatic selection of element technology. No suggestions are issued, and no
              automatic resetting occurs.

        eldegene : str
            Element degenerated shape control:

              enhanced strain, simplified enhanced strain, and B-bar formulations are turned off (default).

            * ``OFF`` - If element shapes are degenerated, regular shape functions are still used, and the
              specified element technologies (for example, enhanced strain, B-bar, uniform reduced integration)
              are still used.
