        Calculates and prints geometry items (centroid location, moments of inertia, length, area, volume
        etc.) associated with the selected keypoints, lines, areas, and volumes. Geometry items are reported
        in the global Cartesian coordinate system. For volumes, a unit density is assumed unless the volumes
        have a material association via the :ref:`vatt` command. For areas, a unit density (and thickness)
        is assumed unless the areas have a material (and real constant) association via the :ref:`aatt`
        command. For lines and keypoints, a unit density is assumed, irrespective of any material
        associations ( :ref:`latt`, :ref:`katt`, :ref:`mat` ). Items calculated by :ref:`gsum` and later
        retrieved by a :ref:`get` or :ref:`starvget`  commands are valid only if the model is not
        modified after the :ref:`gsum` command is issued. This command combines the functions of the

            Type of input for ``VALUE``.

            * ``RATIO`` - Value is the ratio of the distances between keypoints as follows: ( ``KP1`` -
              ``KPNEW`` )/( ``KP1`` - ``KP2`` ).

            * ``DIST`` - Value is the absolute distance between ``KP1`` and ``KPNEW`` (valid only if current

        subtracted from the X, Y, and Z locations of ``KP2`` (respectively) to determine the offsets.
        :ref:`kdist` is valid in any coordinate system except toroidal ( :ref:`csys`,3).

        :ref:`kdist` returns a variable, called ``_RETURN``, which contains the distance value. You can use

        imove : int or str
            Specifies whether keypoints will be moved or newly defined:

            * ``0`` - Additional keypoints will be generated.

            Scale keypoints from pattern beginning with ``NP1`` to ``NP2`` (defaults to ``NP1`` ) in steps
            of ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``NP1`` = ALL, ``NP2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored and pattern is

            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may also be

            of ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``NP1`` = ALL, ``NP2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored and pattern is

            substituted for ``NP1`` ( ``NP2`` and ``NINC`` are ignored).

        rx : str
            Scale factor ratios. Scaling is relative to the origin of the active coordinate system (RR, Rθ,
            RZ for cylindrical, RR, Rθ, RΦ for spherical). If > 1.0, pattern is enlarged. If < 1.0, pattern
            is reduced. Ratios each default to 1.0.

        ry : str
            Scale factor ratios. Scaling is relative to the origin of the active coordinate system (RR, Rθ,
            RZ for cylindrical, RR, Rθ, RΦ for spherical). If > 1.0, pattern is enlarged. If < 1.0, pattern
            is reduced. Ratios each default to 1.0.
