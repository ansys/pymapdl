        ----------
        nset : str

        stloc : str
            Starting location in table for modifying data. For example, if ``STLOC`` = 1, data input in the
            ``V1`` field is the first constant in the set. If ``STLOC`` = 7, data input in the ``V1`` field
            is the seventh constant in the set, etc. Must be greater than zero.

        v1 : str

            unchanged.

            New values assigned to constants in the next five locations. If blank, the value remains
            unchanged.

            unchanged.

        v4 : str
            New values assigned to constants in the next five locations. If blank, the value remains
            unchanged.

        v5 : str

            Delete real constant sets from ``NSET1`` to ``NSET2`` (defaults to ``NSET1`` ) in steps of

        lchk : str
            Specifies the level of element-associativity checking:

            * ``NOCHECK`` - No element-associativity check occurs. This option is the default.

            * ``WARN`` - When a section, material, or real constant is associated with an element, the program
              issues a message warning that the necessary entity has been deleted.

            * ``CHECK`` - The command terminates, and no section, material, or real constant is deleted if it is
