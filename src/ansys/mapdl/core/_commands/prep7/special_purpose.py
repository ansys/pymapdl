        Parameters
        ----------
        loc1 : str
            Constant coordinate location of the first plane of nodes. For ``PLNOPT`` = 1 or 2, the constant
            coordinate location is the global Cartesian coordinate system ( :ref:`csys`,0) location in the X
            or Y direction respectively. For ``PLNOPT`` = 0, the location is the angle in the global
            cylindrical coordinate system ( :ref:`csys`,1).

        loc2 : str
            Constant coordinate location of the second plane of nodes. For ``PLNOPT`` = 1 or 2, the constant
            coordinate location is the global Cartesian coordinate system ( :ref:`csys`,0) location in the X
            or Y direction respectively. For ``PLNOPT`` = 0, the location is the angle (in degrees) in the
            global cylindrical coordinate system ( :ref:`csys`,1).

        loctol : str
            Tolerance on the constant coordinate location for node selection. Defaults to.00001 for
            ``PLNOPT`` = 1 or 2 and.001 degrees for ``PLNOPT`` = 0.

        r1 : str
            Minimum coordinate location along the second plane of nodes. For ``PLNOPT`` = 1 or 2, the
            coordinate location is the global Cartesian coordinate system location in the Y or X direction
            respectively. For ``PLNOPT`` = 0, the coordinate location is the radial coordinate value in the
            global cylindrical coordinate system. Periodic conditions are not applied to nodes at this
            location.

        r2 : str
            Maximum coordinate location along the second plane of nodes. For ``PLNOPT`` = 1 or 2, the
            coordinate location is the global Cartesian coordinate system location in the Y or X direction
            respectively. For ``PLNOPT`` = 0, the coordinate location is the radial coordinate value in the
            global cylindrical coordinate system. Periodic conditions are not applied to nodes at this
            location.

        tolr : str
            Tolerance dimension on node selection along the plane of nodes. Defaults to.00001.

        opt : int or str
            Periodic option:

            * ``1`` - Even symmetry. Apply node coupling such that AZ(i) = AZ(j).

        plnopt : int or str
            Symmetry plane option:

            * ``0`` - Planes of constant angle in the global cylindrical coordinate system ( :ref:`csys`,1).

            * ``1`` - Planes parallel to the global Cartesian X axis ( :ref:`csys`,0).

            * ``2`` - Planes parallel to the global Cartesian Y axis ( :ref:`csys`,0).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PERBC2D_notes:

        :ref:`perbc2d` invokes a Mechanical APDL macro which generates periodic boundary condition
        constraints for
        2D planar magnetic field analysis.

        The macro is restricted to node pairs sharing common coordinate values along symmetry planes
        separated by a constant coordinate value. Planes (or lines) must lie at either constant angles (
        ``PLNOPT`` = 0), constant X values ( ``PLNOPT`` = 1), or constant Y values ( ``PLNOPT`` = 2).

        The macro applies constraint equations ( ``OPT`` = 0, odd symmetry) or node coupling ( ``OPT`` = 1,
        even symmetry) to each node pair sharing a common coordinate value along the symmetry planes. By
        default, periodic conditions are not applied at the first and last node pairs on the symmetry planes
        unless the input location values, R1 and R2, are adjusted to be less than or greater than the actual
        node coordinate values.

        Nodes are selected for application of constraints via :ref:`nsel`, with tolerances on the constant
        coordinate location ( ``LOCTOL`` ) and the coordinate location along the plane (RTOL).

        Mechanical APDL Command: `MSOPT <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_MSOPT.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        option : str
            Multistage cyclic symmetry analysis option. There is no default. You must choose one of the
            following options:

            * ``CSYS`` - Activates a previously defined cyclic coordinate system by the reference number specified in
              ``Value1``. ``Sname`` is ignored. This option is only valid in the /PREP7 processor.

              * ``Value1`` - Cylindrical coordinate system reference number. You must have already created the
                coordinate system by issuing prior commands like :ref:`cs` or :ref:`local` to define it. Defaults to
                1 where the global Cartesian Z axis is the cyclic symmetry axis.

              You must define the coordinate system before defining the stages.

            * ``NEW`` - Creates a new stage with the name entered in ``Sname`` and the ``Value1`` - ``Value6``
              specifications listed in the table below. This option is only valid in the /PREP7 processor.

              * ``Sname`` - An alphanumeric name used to identify the stage. ``Sname`` may be up to 32 characters,
                beginning with a letter and containing only letters, numbers, and underscores. Names beginning with
                an underscore (for example, _LOOP) are reserved for use by Mechanical APDL and should be avoided. The
                component name ALL is not permitted.

              InformalTables need to be added.
              When creating a new stage, the base and duplicate sector meshes should be coincident. The offset
              between the number of base and duplicate coincident nodes is constant throughout the whole model.
              The same is true for the element numbers.

            * ``DELETE`` - Deletes the stage identified by ``Sname``.

              * ``Sname`` - The name of the stage to be deleted. Entities such as nodes and elements contained in
                the stage are unaffected. Only the grouping and the related constraint equations are concerned.

            * ``EXPAND`` - Specifies stages (identified by ``Sname`` ) and sectors (sector number specified in ``Value1`` ) for
              subsequent expansion. This option is only valid in the /POST1 processor.

              * ``Sname`` - The name of the stage to be expanded. A value of 0 resets all expansion settings. A
                value of ALL means all existing stages will be expanded (default).

              * ``Value1`` - The sector number. A value of 0 resets all sector settings. A value of ALL means all
                sectors will be expanded (default).

            * ``LIST`` - Lists the stage identified by ``Sname`` with the level of detail specified in ``Value1``.

              * ``Sname`` - The name of the stage to be listed. If blank, list all stages (default).

              * ``Value1`` - Key for specifying the level of detail.

                * ``0 (, or OFF)`` - Basic listing (default).

                * ``1 (, or ON)`` - Detailed listing, including constraint equations information. Note that the
                  interstage constraint equations number information is only listed for the stage with the smallest
                  number of sectors.

            * ``MODIFY`` - Sets the `harmonic index
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#harmindex>`_
              of a stage identified by ``Sname`` to the integer specified in ``Value1``.

              * ``Sname`` - The name of the stage to be modified.

              * ``Value1`` - The new `harmonic index
                <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#harmindex>`_.
                Existing cyclic and multistage interface constraint equations will be deleted.

            * ``RESET`` - Deletes all stages and resets all multistage analysis settings.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `CYCLIC <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_CYCLIC.html>`_

        **Command default:**

        .. _CYCLIC_default:

        The default :ref:`cyclic` command (issuing the command with no arguments) detects the number of
        sectors ( ``NSECTOR`` ), the sector angle ( ``ANGLE`` ), and the coordinate system ( ``KCN`` ) based
        upon the existing solid or finite-element model. The command also detects sector low- and high-edge
        components in most cases and assigns the default root name CYCLIC to the components.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nsector : str
            The number of sectors in the full 360 degrees, or one of the following options:

            * ``STATUS`` - Indicates the current cyclic status.

            * ``OFF`` - Resets model to normal (non-cyclic) status and removes the duplicate sector if it
              exists. This option also deletes automatically detected edge components (generated when ``USRCOMP``
              = 0).

            * ``UNDOUBLE`` - Removes the duplicate sector if it exists. The duplicate sector is created during
              the solution ( :ref:`solve` ) stage of a modal cyclic symmetry analysis.

              The duplicate sector is necessary for displaying cyclic symmetry analysis results during
              postprocessing ( :ref:`post1` ).

            If you specify a value of STATUS, OFF or UNDOUBLE, the command ignores all remaining arguments.

        angle : str
            The sector angle in degrees.

        kcn : str
            An arbitrary reference number assigned to the cyclic coordinate system. The default value of 0
            specifies automatic detection.

        name : str
            The root name of sector low- and high-edge components (line, area, or node components). The default
            root name (when ``USRCOMP`` = 0) is CYCLIC. A root name that you specify can contain up to 11
            characters.

            The naming convention for each low- and high-edge component pair is either of the following:

            * ``Name`` _m ``xx`` l, ``Name`` _m ``xx`` h (potentially matched node patterns)
            * ``Name`` _u ``xx`` l, ``Name`` _u ``xx`` h (potentially unmatched node patterns)

            The ``Name`` value is the default ( CYCLIC ) or specified root name and ``xx`` is the component pair
            ID number (sequential, starting at 01).

        usrcomp : str
            The number of pairs of user-defined low- and high-edge components on the cyclic sector (if any).
            The default value of 0 specifies automatic detection of sector edges; however, the automatic
            setting is not valid in all cases. (For more information, see the Notes section below.) If the
            value is greater than 0, no verification of user-defined components occurs.

        usrnmap : str
            The name of a user-defined array specifying the matching node pairs between the sector low and high
            edges. Valid only when ``USRCOMP`` = 0. Skips the automatic detection of sector edges. Node pairs
            may be input in any order, but the low edge node must be the first entry in each pair.

            .. code:: apdl

               *DIM,MYMAP,ARRAY,2,14	! specifying 14 low-high edge node pairs
               *set,mymap(1, 1), 107, 108	! low node 107 <> high node 108
               *set,mymap(1, 2), 147, 211	! low node 147 <> high node 211
               *set,mymap(1, 3), 110, 109	! low node 110 <> high node 109

               cyclic,12,,1,,,MYMAP		! use array MYMAP to generate cyclic CEs

        Notes
        -----

        .. _CYCLIC_notes:

        You can input your own value for ``NSECTOR``, ``ANGLE`` or ``KCN`` ; if you do so, the command
        verifies argument values before executing.

        When ``USRCOMP`` = 0 and ``UsrNMap`` = blank (default), the :ref:`cyclic` command automatically
        detects `low- and high-edge components
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycedgecomp.html#>`_ for
        models that consist of any combination of line, area, or volume elements. If a solid model exists,
        however, the command uses only the lines, areas, and/or volumes to determine the low- and high-edge
        components; the elements, if any, are ignored.

        Nodes will be automatically rotated unless :ref:`cycopt`,USRROT,YES has been specified.

        If you issue a :ref:`cycopt`,TOLER command to set a tolerance for edge-component pairing before
        issuing the :ref:`cyclic` command, the :ref:`cyclic` command uses the specified tolerance when
        performing automatic edge-component detection.

        For 2D models, autodetection does not consider the :ref:`csys`,5 or :ref:`csys`,6 coordinate system
        specification. Autodetection for 180 degree (two-sector) models is not possible unless a central
        hole exists.

        The :ref:`cyclic` command sets values and keys so that, if possible, the area-mesh ( :ref:`amesh` )
        or volume-mesh ( :ref:`vmesh` ) command meshes the sector with matching node and element face
        patterns on the low and high edges. (The command has no effect on any other element-creation
        command.)

        Issue the :ref:`cyclic` command prior to the meshing command to, if possible, produce a mesh with
        identical node and element patterns on the low and high sector edges. Only the :ref:`amesh` or
        :ref:`vmesh` commands can perform automated matching. (Other meshing operation commands such as
        :ref:`vsweep` cannot.) If you employ a meshing operation other than :ref:`amesh` or :ref:`vmesh`,
        you should ensure that node and element face patterns match, if desired. The :ref:`cyclic` command
        output indicates whether each edge-component pair has or can produce a matching node pair.

        A cyclic solution (via the :ref:`solve` command) allows dissimilar mesh patterns on the extreme
        boundaries of a cyclically symmetric model. The allowance for dissimilar patterns is useful when you
        have only finite-element meshes for your model but not the geometry data necessary to remesh it to
        obtain identical node patterns. In such cases, it is possible to obtain solution results, although
        perhaps at the expense of accuracy. A warning message appears because results may be degraded near
        the sector edges.

        The constraint equations (CEs) that tie together the low and high edges of your model are generated
        at the solution stage of the analysis from the low- and high-edge components (and nowhere else). You
        should verify that automatically detected components are in the correct locations and that you can
        account for all components; to do so, you can list ( :ref:`cmlist` ) or plot ( :ref:`cmplot` ) the
        components.

        If you issue the :ref:`cyclic` command after meshing and have defined element types with rotational
        degrees of freedom (DOFs), Mechanical APDL generates cyclic CEs for rotational DOFs that may not
        exist on
        the sector boundaries. Issue :ref:`cycopt`,DOF to prevent unused rotational terms from being
        generated.

        Modal cyclic symmetry analysis is supported by the following eigensolvers:

        * Block Lanczos ( :ref:`modopt`,LANB)

        * PCG Lanczos ( :ref:`modopt`,LANPCG)

        * Super Node ( :ref:`modopt`,SNODE)

        * Subspace ( :ref:`modopt`,SUBSP)

        To learn more about analyzing a cyclically symmetric structure, see the `Cyclic Symmetry Analysis
        Guide <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/cycsym_example.html>`_.

        When using the :ref:`cyclic` command to automatically detect the sector, if an area is defined with
        the :ref:`al` command, the lines need to be oriented to form the closed curve.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _CYCFREQ_notes:

        The program solves a cyclically symmetric model (set up via the :ref:`cyclic` command during
        preprocessing) at the harmonic indices specified via the :ref:`cycopt` command.

        When ``Option`` = AERO, the aerodynamic coefficients are specified in a 5Ã(NÃr) array ( :ref:`dim`
        ), where N is the number of blades and r can be any positive integer. Each column has the structure:

        i, m, n, V real, V imag
        where:

        * :math:````  = the i :sup:`th` interblade phase angle (IBPA)
        * :math:````  = the m :sup:`th` vibrating blade mode
        * :math:````  = the n :sup:`th` blade mode generating the pressure oscillations
        * :math:````  and  :math:````  = the real and imaginary coefficients.
        One aerodynamic damping coefficient must be specified for each IBPA (equal to the number of blades)
        while keeping m and n constant.

        The following table shows how the IBPA index ( :math:```` ) relates to other quantities for a system
        with 22 blades:

        InformalTables need to be added.
        The :ref:`cycfreq`,AERO command is only valid if :ref:`cycfreq`,BLADE is also specified. The blade
        mode numbers, m and n, are relative to the values kept in the :ref:`cycfreq`,BLADE command.

        For constant (frequency-independent) mistuning, the stiffness parameters are specified in an NÃ1
        array ( :ref:`dim` ) where N is the number of blades.

        For stiffness mistuning, each row entry represents the deviation of Young``s modulus from nominal,
        :math:````  (or equivalently, the ratio of the frequency deviationsquared). Each frequency can also
        be independently mistuned, in whichcase the array is NtimesM, where M is the number of blade
        frequencies( ``Value3`` of :ref:`cycfreq`,BLADE). The entries in each row therefore correspond to
        the ratio of the mistuned frequency to the tuned frequency squared minus one:

        Î´ f i n = ( Ï Â¯ i n Ï i n ) 2 - 1
        The USER option activates the solution macro :file:`CYCMSUPUSERSOLVE.MAC`. The normal solution is
        skipped. You may implement your own mistuning solution using APDL and APDL Math operations, or call
        your own program for the solution.

        The :ref:`cycfreq` command is valid in the preprocessing and solution stages of an analysis.

        The :ref:`cycfreq`,MODAL,ON command writes modal frequencies to the output file. No other
        postprocessing is available for this modal solve.

        When using :ref:`cycfreq`,RESTART, only mistuning parameters or frequency range may be changed. All
        other changes in parameters are ignored. This type of restart can only be performed by exiting the
        current mistuning solution using :ref:`finish` and re-entering the solution phase using
        :ref:`slashsolu` and then calling the desired :ref:`cycfreq`,RESTART command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option : str
            Cyclic symmetry analysis option. There is no default. You must choose o ne of the following options:

            * ``BCMULT`` - Controls whether cyclic sector array parameter names are reused or created new for multiple
              entities.

              * ``Value1`` - The flag value.

                * ``0 (OFF or NO)`` - Create new array parameter names (default)

                * ``1(ON or YES)`` - Reuse array parameter names

            * ``COMBINE`` - For linear `static cyclic symmetryanalysis
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycstaticans.html#cycsym_postproc_stat>`_
              with `non-cyclically symmetric loading
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycsolarch.html#>`_ only,
              expands and combines all harmonic index solutions and writes them to the results file during the
              solution phase of the analysis.

              * ``Value1`` - The flag value.

                * ``0 (OFF or NO)`` - Disable combining of harmonic index solutions (default)

                * ``1 (ON or YES)`` - Enable combining of harmonic index solutions

            * ``DEFAULT`` - Set the default cyclic solution settings.

            * ``DOF`` - The degrees of freedom to couple from the nodes on the low sector boundary to nodes on the high
              boundary:

              * ``Value1`` - The component pair ID number.

              * ``Value., Value., Value....., Value7`` - The constraint-equation/-coupling degree of freedom
                (DOF) for this pair. Repeat the command to add other DOFs. The default is constraint-
                equation/-coupling all applicable DOFs.

            * ``FACETOL`` - Tolerance for inclusion of surface nodes into your base sector. Autodetect defaults to 15Â°,
              accommodating most sections. Specify a new ``Value1`` only when extreme cut angles or complex model
              geometry cause surface nodes to be excluded. See Notes (below) for more information.

              Ansys, Inc. recommends that successful auto-detection depends more on the value of ANGTOL
              than the value of FACETOL. Please refer to `CYCOPTAuto Detection Tolerance Adjustments for Difficult
              Cases
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycedgecomp.html#gadvcycopttol7>`_
              :ref:`cycopt` command.

              * ``Value1`` - The face tolerance applies only to auto detection from node/element models (already
                meshed and no solid model), and it defaults to 15Â°.

            * ``HINDEX`` - The `harmonic index
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#harmindex>`_
              ranges to be solved. Applies to static and harmonic analyses only if :ref:`CYCOPT_HINDEXValue5`
              ``Value5`` = STATIC.

              By default, the :ref:`solve` command loops through all available harmonic indices. `Static
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycstaticans.html#cycsym_postproc_stat>`_
              and `harmonic
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#harmindex>`_
              analyses only solve harmonic indices required for the applied loads. All other analyses solve them
              all.

              * ``EVEN / ODD`` - For low-frequency electromagnetic analysis only, EVEN specifies a symmetric
                solution and ODD specifies an antisymmetric solution.

                The value you specify is based on the `harmonic index
                <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#harmindex>`_
                : EVEN (default) indicates harmonic index = 0, and ODD indicates harmonic index = ``N`` / 2 (where
                ``N`` is an integer representing the number of sectors in 360Â°). A value of ODD applies only when
                ``N`` is an even number.

                The :ref:`cycopt` command with this HINDEX option is cumulative. To remove an option (for example,
                EVEN), issue this command: :ref:`cycopt`,HINDEX,EVEN,,,-1

              * ``ALL`` - Solve all applicable harmonic indices. ``Value2`` must be blank.

              * ``Value1, Value2, Value3`` - Solve harmonic indices in range ``Value1`` through ``Value2`` in
                steps of ``Value3``. Repeat the command to add other ranges. The default solves all applicable
                harmonic indices.

              * ``Value4`` - The only valid value is -1. If specified, it removes ``Value1`` through ``Value2`` in
                steps of ``Value3`` from the set to solve. By default, if ``Value4`` = -1 then ``Value1`` = 0,
                ``Value2`` = 0, and ``Value3`` = 1.

              * ``Value5`` - For `static
                <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycstaticans.html#cycsym_postproc_stat>`_
                and `harmonic
                <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#harmindex>`_
                analyses, enter either a number or STATIC:

                If ``Value5`` = <number>  the number entered sets the tolerance for determining if the Fourier
                contribution of a load is significant (default = 1.0E-5). In this case, the harmonic index selection
                is disabled.

                If ``Value5`` = STATIC the harmonic index selection is enabled, and no verification is done on the
                significance of unselected harmonic indicies. Improper selection of the harmonic index range may
                produce incomplete (incorrect) results.

            * ``LDSECT`` - Restricts subsequently defined force loads and surface loads to a specified sector. The restriction
              remains in effect until you change or reset it. This option is not available for harmonic analyses
              based on mode-superposition ( :ref:`cycopt`,MSUP,1)

              * ``Value1`` - The sector number. A value other than 0 (default) is valid for a cyclic symmetry
                analysis with `non- cyclically symmetricloading
                <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycsolarch.html#>`_ only. A
                value of 0 (or ALL) resets the default behavior for cyclic loading (where the loads are identical on
                all sectors).

            * ``MOVE`` - Specifies if the program should move high- or low-edge component nodes paired within the specified
              tolerance (TOLER) to create precisely matching pairs.

              * ``Value1`` - The flag value.

                * ``0`` - Do not move edge component nodes (default)

                * ``1 or HIGH`` - Move the high-edge component nodes to precisely match the low-edge component nodes

                * ``-1 or LOW`` - Move the low-edge component nodes to precisely match the high-edge component nodes

            * ``MSUP`` - This flag is used to limit the results written to the :file:`Jobname.MODE` and :file:`Jobname.RST`
              files in a modal cyclic symmetry analysis. In a linear perturbation analysis, the modal analysis and
              the first load step of the preceding base analysis must be set to the same value.

              * ``Value1`` - The flag value.

                * ``0 (OFF or NO)`` - Write results for the base and duplicate sectors to the :file:`Jobname.MODE`
                  and :file:`Jobname.RST` files.

                * ``1 (ON or YES)`` - Write only the base sector results to the :file:`Jobname.MODE` and
                  :file:`Jobname.RST` files for use in a subsequent mode-superposition-based analysis. Default, except
                  for cyclic unsymmetric modal, LANPCG, and SNODE solutions, which use ``Value1`` = 0 as the default.
                  This option is not valid for cyclic unsymmetric modal, LANPCG, and SNODE solutions.

            * ``STATUS`` - List the solution option settings active for the cyclic model.

            * ``TOLER`` - The tolerance used to determine whether a node on the low edge is paired with a node on the high
              edge.

              * ``Value1`` - The tolerance value.

                * ``Greater than 0`` - The absolute distance tolerance for automatic sector-boundary detection and
                  low-/high-edge component node pairing

                * ``Less than 0`` - The relative tolerance for automatic sector-boundary detection and low-/high-edge component node
                  pairing. In this case, the tolerance is ``Value1`` \* ``Length``, where ``Length`` is the length of the diagonal of an imaginary box enclosing the model

                * ``0`` - Tolerance is set to -1.0 x 10 :sup:`-4` (default)

              * ``Value2`` - ``ANGTOL`` = Maximum allowable angle tolerance. (default = 0.01Â°)

                The valid range for ``ANGTOL`` is model dependent.

                If you input both the number of sectors and a sector angle, the angle must match 360/(number of
                sectors) within ``ANGTOL``.

                If you input only a sector angle, it must divide evenly into 360Â° within ``ANGTOL``.

                If you input a sector angle, the final cyclic sector must span that angle within ``ANGTOL``.

                For auto detected sector angle, the final cyclic sector must span 360/(number of sectors) within
                ``ANGTOL``, everywhere along the LOW/HIGH boundaries.

                If ``ANGTOL`` is too small, your CAD or FEA model may not be accurate enough to allow auto detection
                or verification.

                If ``ANGTOL`` is too large, you may get an unexpected or incorrect boundary definition, or in other
                cases fail to detect the boundaries.

                For some difficult cases from FEA models (not solid models), you may need to change the value of
                ``FACETOL`` to achieve auto detection. Please refer to `CYCOPTAuto Detection Tolerance Adjustments
                for Difficult Cases
                <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycedgecomp.html#gadvcycopttol7>`_
                :ref:`cycopt` command.

            * ``USRROT`` - Flag specifying whether the program should override automatic nodal rotations to edge components and
              allow you to apply nodal rotations manually.

              * ``Value1`` - The flag value.

                * ``0 (OFF or NO)`` - Allow automatic node rotation (default)

                * ``1 (ON or YES)`` - Suppress automatic node rotation. If you select this option, you must apply
                  appropriate nodal rotations to all edge component nodes; otherwise, your analysis will yield
                  incorrect solution results.

                * ``LOW`` - Suppresses automatic rotation of low-edge component nodes only, allowing you to apply
                  them manually. Automatic rotation of high-edge component nodes occurs to produce the matching edge
                  nodes required for a valid cyclic solution.

                * ``HIGH`` - Suppresses automatic rotation of high-edge component nodes only, allowing you to apply
                  them manually. Automatic rotation of low-edge component nodes occurs to produce the matching edge
                  nodes required for a valid cyclic solution.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _CYCOPT_notes:

        The program solves a cyclically symmetric model (set up via the :ref:`cyclic` command during
        preprocessing) at the harmonic indices specified via the :ref:`cycopt` command.

        The :ref:`cycopt`,COMBINE option is an alternative to the :ref:`cycexpand` command and is especially
        useful for testing purposes. However, Ansys, Inc. recommends specifying COMBINE only when
        the number of sectors is relatively small. (The option expands nodes and elements into the full 360Â°
        and can slow postprocessing significantly.

        If you issue a :ref:`cycopt`,TOLER command to set a tolerance for `edge-component
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycedgecomp.html#>`_ pairing
        before issuing the :ref:`cyclic` command, the :ref:`cyclic` command uses the specified tolerance
        when performing automatic edge-component detection.

        In cases involving `non-cyclically symmetric loading
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycsolarch.html#>`_ (that is,
        when LDSECT > 0), the underlying command operations create or modify the required SECTOR tabular
        boundary condition (BC) data to apply on the appropriate sector. Therefore, it is not necessary to
        manipulate tables for situations where the applied BC is not a function of other tabular BC
        variables such as TIME, X, Y, Z, and so on.

        To delete a previously applied load on a specified sector, issue an :ref:`fdele` command.

        Because edge nodes are rotated into the cyclic coordinate system during solution, any applied
        displacements or forces on sector edges will be in the cyclic coordinate system.

        The :ref:`cycopt` command is valid in the preprocessing and solution stages of an analysis.

        To learn more about analyzing a cyclically symmetric structure, see the `Cyclic Symmetry Analysis

                (although the default reverts to 1 or ON if the cyclic count varies between active windows).

              * ``1 or ON`` - No averaging of stresses or strains occurs, and sector boundaries are shown on the
                plot. This setting is not valid for cyclic MSUP harmonic analyses.

            * ``PHASEANG`` - Possible ``Value1`` settings are:

              * ``n`` - The phase angle shift in degrees. The valid range for ``n``  is 0 through 360. The default
                is 0. For a modal solution, this value is typically the phase angle obtained via the :ref:`cycphase`
                command. The expanded modal results are printed or displayed for the specified phase angle shift.

              * ``AMPLITUDE (or, n â¥ 360)`` - The amplitude is reported, except for the following circumstances where the amplitude solution is
                not valid:

                * non-component results (such as equivalent stress)

                * modal analyses (no amplitude is calculated, and the expanded modal results are printed or
                  displayed at a phase angle of 360Âº).

              * ``SWEEP`` - For a mode-superposition harmonic solution, the maximum values across a phase angle
                sweep are reported.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-CYCEXPAND_notes:

        In preprocessing, the :ref:`cycexpand` command verifies a cyclically symmetric model by graphically
        expanding it partially or through the full 360 degrees.

        For the postprocessing plot nodal solution ( :ref:`plnsol` ) operation, the command graphically
        expands displacements, stresses and strains of a cyclically symmetric model partially or though the
        full 360 degrees by combining the real (original nodes and elements) and imaginary (duplicate nodes
        and elements) parts of the solution.

        For the print nodal solution ( :ref:`prnsol` ) operation, the command expands the printed output of
        displacements or stresses on a sector-by-sector basis. To learn more about specific :ref:`prnsol`
        behaviors in cyclic analyses, see `Using the /CYCEXPAND Command
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycpost.html#>`_

        Use of the :ref:`cycexpand` command does not change the database. The command does not modify the
        geometry, nodal displacements or element stresses.

        The command affects element and result plots only. It has no effect on operations other than plot
        element solution ( :ref:`plesol` ), plot nodal solution ( :ref:`plnsol` ), print nodal solution (
        :ref:`prnsol` ), and calculate harmonic solution ( :ref:`cyccalc` ). Operations other than
        :ref:`plesol`, :ref:`plnsol`, :ref:`prnsol`, or :ref:`cyccalc` work on the unprocessed real and
        imaginary parts of a cyclic symmetry solution

        If you issue a :ref:`cycexpand`, OFF command, you cannot then expand the model by simply issuing
        another :ref:`cycexpand` command (for example, to specify an NREPEAT value for the number of
        repetitions). In such a case, you must specify :ref:`cycexpand`, ON, which activates expansion
        using the previous settings (if any) or the default settings.

        The command requires PowerGraphics and will turn PowerGraphics on ( :ref:`graphics`, POWER ) if not
        already active. Any setting which bypasses PowerGraphics (for example, :ref:`pbf` ) also bypasses
        cyclic expansion; in such cases, the :ref:`cycexpand` command displays unprocessed real and
        imaginary results.

        The :ref:`cycphase` command uses full model graphics ( :ref:`graphics`, FULL ) to compute peak
        values. Because of this, there may be slight differences between max/min values obtained with
        :ref:`cycphase`, and those obtained via :ref:`cycexpand`, which uses power graphics (
        :ref:`graphics`, POWER ).

        For PHASEANG = AMPLITUDE (or 360) with a cyclic full harmonic solution, the only appropriate
        coordinate system is the solution coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys`,SOLU).

        Load case operations ( :ref:`lcoper` ) are not valid during a cyclic expansion using
        :ref:`cycexpand`.

        Guide <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/cycsym_example.html>`_.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _cint_notes:

        Initiate a new calculation via the ``Action`` = NEW parameter. Subsequent :ref:`cint` commands (with
        parameters other than NEW) define the input required for the fracture-parameter calculations.

        The simplest method is to define crack information via ``Action`` = CTNC; however, this method
        limits you to only one node for a given location along the crack front. Use the CTNC option only
        when all nodes that define the crack front lie in a single plane.

        For ``Action`` = SURF, ``Par1`` and ``Par2`` can be the top or bottom crack-face node component. No
        order is required, provided that if one value the top crach-face node component, the other must be
        the bottom, and vice-versa. This option is valid only with :ref:`cgrow` for crack-growth simulation.

        To define crack information at multiple locations along the crack front, use ``Action`` = CENC. You
        can issue :ref:`cint`,CENC, ``Par1``, etc. multiple times to define the crack-extension node
        component, the crack tip, and the crack-extension directions at multiple locations along the crack
        front.

        Although you can vary the sequence of your definitions, all specified crack-tip nodes must be at the
        crack front, and no crack-tip node can be omitted.

        You can define the crack-extension direction directly by specifying either ``Action`` = CENC or
        ``Action`` = NORM.

        The crack-assist extension direction ( ``Action`` = EDIR) provides a generic extension direction
        when ``Action`` = CTNC. It helps to define crack-extension directions based on the connectivity of
        the crack-front elements. For a 2D case when the crack tangent cannot be calculated, the program
        uses the provided crack-assist extension direction directly.

        For an `XFEM-based crack-growth
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_frac/Hlp_G_FRACXFEM.html#fracxfemreferences>`_
        analysis:

        * ``Action`` = CTNC, CENC, NCON, SYMM, UMM, or EDIR have no effect.

        * ``Action`` = CXFE, RADIUS, or RSWEEP are XFEM-specific and invalid for any other type of crack-
          growth analysis.

        * For :ref:`cint`,TYPE, only ``Par1`` = PSMAX or STTMAX are valid. Other ``Par1`` values have no
          effect.

        The stress-intensity factors calculation ( :ref:`cint`,TYPE,SIFS) applies only to isotropic linear
        elasticity. Use only one material type for the crack-tip elements that are used for the
        calculations.

        When calculating energy release rates ( :ref:`cint`,TYPE,VCCT), do not restrict the results from
        being written to the database ( :ref:`config`,NOELDB,1) after solution processing; otherwise,
        incorrect and potentially random results are possible.

        Fracture-parameter calculations based on domain integrations such as stress-intensity factors,
        J-integral, or material force are not supported when contact elements exist inside the domain. The
        calculations may become path-dependent unless the contact pressure is negligible.

        For ``Action`` = UMM, the default value can be OFF or ON `depending on the element type
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_frac/fracumm.html#cintondefaulttab>`_.
        The :ref:`cint` command overrides the default setting for the given element.

        The :ref:`cint` command supports only strain data for initial state (
        :ref:`inistate`,SET,DTYP,EPEL). Other initial-state capabilities are not supported.

        For more information about using the :ref:`cint` command, including supported element types and
        material behavior, see `Calculating Fracture Parameters

        Notes
        -----

        .. _AEROCOEFF_notes:

        The :ref:`aerocoeff` command is designed to `generate an array of aerodynamic coefficients
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/cycsym_aero_coupling.html#>`_
        that can be used in a cyclic mode-superposition harmonic response analysis using the
        :ref:`cycfreq`,AERO command to represent aerodynamic stiffness and damping. These aerodynamic
        coefficients can also be used in a damped modal analysis phase ( :ref:`cycfreq`,MODAL) of a cyclic
        mode-superposition harmonic solve. An APDL array called ``Jobname`` AeroArray is generated using the
        :ref:`aerocoeff` command. This array is compatible with the array needed for the :ref:`cycfreq`,AERO
        command.

        The format of the written array follows that of the :ref:`cycfreq`,AERO command. The array is
        formatted as follows:

        i, m, n, V real, V imag
        where

        * :math:````  = the i :sup:`th` interblade phase angle (IBPA)
        * :math:````  = the m :sup:`th` vibrating blade mode
        * :math:````  = the n :sup:`th` blade mode generating the pressure oscillations
        * :math:````  and  :math:````  = the real and imaginary coefficients.

        Prior to issuing the :ref:`aerocoeff` command, a non-cyclic cantilevered blade modal analysis must
        be run, either stress-free or prestressed using linear perturbation. For more information, see
        `Modal Analysis
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/Hlp_G_STR_SMSUP.html>`_
        :ref:`aerocoeff` command are the same as those needed for modal restart as described in `Modal
        Analysis Restart
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS3_12.html#modalrestex>`_

        The ``AeroSpecs`` values are specified in a 3Ãr array ( :ref:`dim` ), wherer is a positive integer
        equal to the number of interblade phase angles and the pressure modes solved for in the CFD
        analysis. Each row has the structure:

        i, m, n
        where

        * :math:````  = the i :sup:`th` interblade phase angle (IBPA)
        * :math:````  = the m :sup:`th` vibrating blade mode
        * :math:````  = the n :sup:`th` blade mode generating the pressure oscillations
        At least one aerodynamic damping coefficient must be specified for each IBPA (equal to the number of
        blades) while keeping
         :math:````  and  :math:````  constant. If a value is not specified, the program writes an array value of      zero for both  :math:````  and  :math:````. The values of  :math:````  and  :math:````  are relative to the modes computed in the required modal analysis.

        The number of ``AeroScalar`` values must be equal to the number of pressure modes ( :math:````  from
        ``AeroSpecs`` ). If the number of ``AeroScalar`` values is greater than 1, the values must be
        entered by defining an :math:````  array ( :ref:`dim` ) and entering the array name in the
        ``AeroScalar`` field. For a discussion of how ``AeroScalar`` values are computed, see `Scaling
        Aerodynamic Coupling Coefficients
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/cycsym_aero_coupling.html#>`_

        The value for ``nBlades`` should be equal to the number of sectors of the system. If there are
        multiple blades per cyclic sector, then the combination of blades on the single sector will have an
        aero coefficient value. In this case, each blade will not have a distinct aero coefficient.

        .. _SSTATE_notes:

        The :ref:`sstate` command specifies steady-state rolling analysis parameters for the given element
        component. The program runs the steady-state rolling analysis if the corresponding element key
        option is enabled for that element component.

        The command supports the following elements:

        InformalTables need to be added.
        For information about steady-state rolling for rebar and solid elements, see `Steady-State Rolling
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_geosteadystroll.html#>`_

        .. _sstate_define_spec:

        The following data types can be defined:

        * SPIN -- Spinning motion

        * TRANSLATE -- Rigid body motion (velocity) that the spinning component is undergoing

        **Define the steady-state spinning motion:**

        :ref:`sstate`, DEFINE, ``CM_Name``, SPIN, ``OMEGA``, ``Method``, ``Val4``, ``Val5``, ``Val6``,
        ``Val7``, ``Val8``, ``Val9``

        * ``OMEGA`` - Spin velocity

        * ``Method`` - Method to use for defining the spin axis:

          * ``POINTS`` - Define the spin axis using two points:

            ``Val4``, ``Val5``, ``Val6`` -- Coordinates of the first point

            ``Val7``, ``Val8``, ``Val9`` -- Coordinates of the second point

            This definition method is currently the only option.

              **Example: Defining Steady-State Spinning Motion**

              This command defines a steady-state spinning motion of 120 rad/s around the spin axis:

              .. code:: apdl

                 SSTATE,DEFINE, CM_Name,SPIN,120,POINTS,0,0,0,0,1,0

              In this case, two points with coordinates (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) define the spin axis in the global Y
              direction.

        **Define the rigid body motion (velocity):**

        :ref:`sstate`, DEFINE, ``CM_Name``, TRANSLATE, ``Val2``, ``Val3``, ``Val4``

        * ``Val2``, ``Val3``, ``Val4`` -- Rigid body velocity components

        .. _sstate_list_spec:

        :ref:`sstate`, LIST, ``CM_Name``

        Lists all steady-state rolling analysis data defined on the specified element component. All data is
        listed if no component ( ``CM_Name`` ) is specified.

        .. _sstate_delete_spec:

        :ref:`sstate`, DELETE, ``CM_Name``

        Deletes all steady-state rolling analysis data defined on the specified element component. All data
        is deleted if no component ( ``CM_Name`` ) is specified.
