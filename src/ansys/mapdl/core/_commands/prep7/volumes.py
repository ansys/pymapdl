        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Label identifying the control option. The meanings of ``Val1``, ``Val2``, and ``Val3`` will vary depending on ``Lab``.

            * ``ON`` - Sets carryover of the material attributes, real constant attributes, and element
              coordinate system attributes of the pattern area elements to the generated volume elements. Sets the
              pattern area mesh to clear when volume generations are done. ``Val1``, ``Val2``, and ``Val3`` are
              ignored.

            * ``OFF`` - Removes all settings associated with this command. ``Val1``, ``Val2``, and ``Val3`` are
              ignored.

            * ``STAT`` - Shows all settings associated with this command. ``Val1``, ``Val2``, ``Val3``, and
              ``Val4`` are ignored.

            * ``ATTR`` - Sets carryover of particular pattern area attributes (materials, real constants, and element
              coordinate systems) of the pattern area elements to the generated volume elements. (See :ref:`EXTOPT.notes.2`.) ``Val1`` can be:

              * ``0`` - Sets volume elements to use current :ref:`mat` command settings.

              * ``1`` - Sets volume elements to use material attributes of the pattern area elements.

               ``Val2`` can be:

              * ``0`` - Sets volume elements to use current :ref:`real` command settings.

              * ``1`` - Sets volume elements to use real constant attributes of the pattern area elements.

               ``Val3`` can be:

              * ``0`` - Sets volume elements to use current :ref:`esys` command settings.

              * ``1`` - Sets volume elements to use element coordinate system attributes of the pattern area
                elements.

               ``Val4`` can be:

              * ``0`` - Sets volume elements to use current :ref:`secnum` command settings.

              * ``1`` - Sets volume elements to use section attributes of the pattern area elements.

            * ``ESIZE`` - Val1 sets the number of element divisions in the direction of volume generation or
              volume sweep. For :ref:`vdrag` and :ref:`vsweep`, ``Val1`` is overridden by the :ref:`lesize`
              command ``NDIV`` setting. ``Val2`` sets the spacing ratio (bias) in the direction of volume
              generation or volume sweep. If positive, ``Val2`` is the nominal ratio of last division size to
              first division size (if > 1.0, sizes increase, if < 1.0, sizes decrease). If negative, ``Val2`` is
              the nominal ratio of center division(s) size to end divisions size. Ratio defaults to 1.0 (uniform
              spacing). ``Val3`` and ``Val4`` are ignored.

            * ``ACLEAR`` - Sets clearing of pattern area mesh. (See :ref:`EXTOPT.notes.3`.) ``Val1`` can be:

              * ``0`` - Sets pattern area to remain meshed when volume generation is done.

              * ``1`` - Sets pattern area mesh to clear when volume generation is done. ``Val2``, ``Val3``, and
                ``Val4`` are ignored.

            * ``VSWE`` - Indicates that volume sweeping options will be set using ``Val1`` and ``Val2``. Settings specified with :ref:`extopt`, ``VSWE`` will be used the next time the :ref:`vsweep` command is invoked. If ``Lab`` = VSWE, ``Val1`` becomes a label. ``Val1`` can be:

              * ``AUTO`` - Indicates whether you will be prompted for the source and target used by :ref:`vsweep`
                or if VSWE should automatically determine the source and target. If ``Val1`` = AUTO, ``Val2`` is ON
                by default. VSWE will automatically determine the source and target for :ref:`vsweep`. You will be
                allowed to pick more than one volume for sweeping. When ``Val2`` = OFF, the application prompts you
                for the source and target for :ref:`vsweep`. You will only be allowed to pick one volume for
                sweeping.

              * ``TETS`` - Indicates whether :ref:`vsweep` will tet mesh non-sweepable volumes or leave them
                unmeshed. If ``Val1`` = TETS, ``Val2`` is OFF by default. Non-sweepable volumes will be left
                unmeshed. When ``Val2`` = ON, the non-sweepable volumes will be tet meshed if the assigned element
                type supports tet shaped elements.

                ``Val3`` is ignored for Lab = VSWE.

        val1 : str
            Additional input values as described under each option for ``Lab``.

        val2 : str
            Additional input values as described under each option for ``Lab``.

        val3 : str
            Additional input values as described under each option for ``Lab``.

        val4 : str
            Additional input values as described under each option for ``Lab``.

        .. _EXTOPT_notes:

        :ref:`extopt` controls options relating to the generation of volume elements from pattern area
        elements using the :ref:`vext`, :ref:`vrotat`, :ref:`voffst`, :ref:`vdrag`, and :ref:`vsweep`
        commands. (When using :ref:`vsweep`, the pattern area is referred to as the source area.)

        Enables carryover of the attributes of the pattern area elements to the generated volume elements
        when you are using :ref:`vext`, :ref:`vrotat`, :ref:`voffst`, or :ref:`vdrag`. (When using
        :ref:`vsweep`, since the volume already exists, use the :ref:`vatt` command to assign attributes
        before sweeping.)

        When you are using :ref:`vext`, :ref:`vrotat`, :ref:`voffst`, or :ref:`vdrag`, enables clearing of
        the pattern area mesh when volume generations are done. (When you are using :ref:`vsweep`, if
        selected, the area meshes on the pattern (source), target, and/or side areas clear when volume
        sweeping is done.)

        Neither :ref:`extopt`,VSWE,AUTO nor :ref:`extopt`,VSWE,TETS will be affected by :ref:`extopt`,ON or
        :ref:`extopt`, OFF.

        rx : str
            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates in active coordinate system
            ( RR, R θ, RZ for cylindrical; RR, R θ, R Φ for spherical). Note that the R θ and R Φ scale
            factors are interpreted as angular offsets. For example, if CSYS = 1, ``RX``, ``RY``, ``RZ``
            input of (1.5,10,3) would scale the specified keypoints 1.5 times in the radial and 3 times in
            the Z direction, while adding an offset of 10 degrees to the keypoints. Zero, blank, or negative
            scale factor values are assumed to be 1.0. Zero or blank angular offsets have no effect.

        ry : str
            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates in active coordinate system
            ( RR, R θ, RZ for cylindrical; RR, R θ, R Φ for spherical). Note that the R θ and R Φ scale
            factors are interpreted as angular offsets. For example, if CSYS = 1, ``RX``, ``RY``, ``RZ``

            Increment to be applied to keypoint numbers for generated set. If zero, the lowest available

        noelem : int or str
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            * ``0`` - Nodes and elements associated with the original volumes will be generated (scaled) if they
              exist.

            * ``1`` - Nodes and elements will not be generated.

        imove : int or str
            Specifies whether volumes will be moved or newly defined:

            * ``0`` - Additional volumes will be generated.

            * ``1`` - Original volumes will be moved to new position ( ``KINC`` and ``NOELEM`` are ignored). Use
              only if the old volumes are no longer needed at their original positions. Corresponding meshed items

        kinc : str
            Keypoint increment between sets. If zero, the lowest available keypoint numbers are assigned (
            :ref:`numstr` ).

        noelem : int or str
            Specifies whether elements and nodes are also to be generated:

            * ``0`` - Generate nodes and elements associated with the original volumes, if they exist.

            * ``1`` - Do not generate nodes and elements.

        imove : int or str
            Specifies whether to redefine the existing volumes:

            * ``0`` - Generate additional volumes.

            * ``1`` - Move original volumes to new position retaining the same keypoint numbers ( ``KINC`` and
              ``NOELEM`` are ignored). Corresponding meshed items are also moved if not needed at their original
              position.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _VDRAG_notes:

        Generates volumes (and their corresponding keypoints, lines, and areas) by sweeping a given area
        pattern along a characteristic drag path. If the drag path consists of multiple lines, the drag
        direction is determined by the sequence in which the path lines are input ( ``NLP1``, ``NLP2``,
        etc.). If the drag path is a single line ( ``NLP1`` ), the drag direction is from the keypoint on
        the drag line that is closest to the first keypoint of the given area pattern to the other end of
        the drag line.

        The magnitude of the vector between the keypoints of the given pattern and the first path keypoint
        remains constant for all generated keypoint patterns and the path keypoints. The direction of the
        vector relative to the path slope also remains constant so that patterns may be swept around curves.
        Lines are generated with the same shapes as the given pattern and the path lines.

        Keypoint, line, area, and volume numbers are automatically assigned (beginning with the lowest
        available values ( :ref:`numstr` )). Adjacent lines use a common keypoint, adjacent areas use a
        common line, and adjacent volumes use a common area. For best results, the entities to be dragged
        should be orthogonal to the start of the drag path. Drag operations that produce an error message
        may create some of the desired entities prior to terminating.

        If element attributes have been associated with the input area via the :ref:`aatt` command, the
        opposite area generated by the :ref:`vdrag` operation will also have those attributes (that is, the
        element attributes from the input area are copied to the opposite area). Note that only the area
        opposite the input area will have the same attributes as the input area; the areas adjacent to the
        input area will not.

        If the input areas are meshed or belong to a meshed volume, the area(s) can be extruded to a 3D
        mesh. Note that the ``NDIV`` argument of the :ref:`esize` command should be set before extruding the
        meshed areas. Alternatively, mesh divisions can be specified directly on the drag line(s) (
        :ref:`lesize` ). See the `Modeling and Meshing Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_mod/Hlp_G_MOD14.html>`_ for more
        information.

        You can use the :ref:`vdrag` command to generate 3D interface element meshes for elements
        ``INTER194``and ``INTER195``. When generating interface element meshes using :ref:`vdrag`, you must
        specify the line divisions to generate one interface element directly on the drag line using the
        :ref:`lesize` command. The source area to be extruded becomes the bottom surface of the interface
        element. Interface elements must be extruded in what will become the element's local x direction,
        that is, bottom to top.

        Calculates and prints geometry statistics (volume, centroid location, moments of inertia, etc.)

        Setting a finer degree of tessellation will provide area calculations with greater accuracy,

        For very thin volumes, such that the ratio of the minimum to the maximum dimension is less than

        .. _VROTAT_notes:

        Generates cylindrical volumes (and their corresponding keypoints, lines, and areas) by rotating an
        area pattern (and its associated line and keypoint patterns) about an axis. Keypoint patterns are
        generated at regular angular locations (based on a maximum spacing of 90°). Line patterns are
        generated at the keypoint patterns. Arc lines are also generated to connect the keypoints
        circumferentially. Keypoint, line, area, and volume numbers are automatically assigned (beginning
        with the lowest available values). Adjacent lines use a common keypoint, adjacent areas use a common
        line, and adjacent volumes use a common area.

        To generate a single volume with an arc greater than 180°, ``NSEG`` must be greater than or equal to
        2.

        If element attributes have been associated with the input area via the :ref:`aatt` command, the
        opposite area generated by the :ref:`vrotat` operation will also have those attributes (that is, the
        element attributes from the input area are copied to the opposite area). Note that only the area
        opposite the input area will have the same attributes as the input area; the areas adjacent to the
        input area will not.

        If the given areas are meshed or belong to meshed volumes, the 2D mesh can be rotated (extruded) to
        a 3D mesh. See the `Modeling and Meshing Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_mod/Hlp_G_MOD14.html>`_ for more
        information. Note that the ``NDIV`` argument on the
        :ref:`esize` command should be set before extruding the meshed areas.

        **Notes**

        .. _V_notes:

        Defines a volume (and its corresponding lines and areas) through eight (or fewer) existing
        keypoints. Keypoints must be input in a continuous order. The order of the keypoints should be
        around the bottom and then the top. Missing lines are generated "straight" in the active coordinate
        system and assigned the lowest available numbers ( :ref:`numstr` ). Missing areas are generated and
        assigned the lowest available numbers.

        Solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is not recommended.

         Certain faces may be condensed to a line or point by repeating keypoints. For example, use
        :ref:`v`, ``P1``, ``P2``, ``P3``, ``P3``, ``P5``, ``P6``, ``P7``, ``P7`` for a triangular prism or
        :ref:`v`, ``P1``, ``P2``, ``P3``, ``P3``, ``P5``, ``P5``, ``P5``, ``P5`` for a tetrahedron.

        Using keypoints to produce partial sections in :ref:`csys` = 2 can generate anomalies; check the
        resulting volumes carefully.

        Generates a reflected set of volumes (and their corresponding keypoints, lines, areas and mesh) from

        element attributes from the input area are copied to the opposite area). Note that only the area
        opposite the input area will have the same attributes as the input area; the areas adjacent to the
        input area will not.

        If the areas are meshed or belong to meshed volumes, a 3D mesh can be extruded with this command.
        Note that the ``NDIV`` argument on the :ref:`esize` command should be set before extruding the
        meshed areas.

        Scaling of the input areas, if specified, is performed first, followed by the extrusion.

        In a non-Cartesian coordinate system, the :ref:`vext` command locates the end face of the volume
        based on the active coordinate system. However, the extrusion is made along a straight line between
        the end faces. Note that solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is not recommended.

        .. warning::

            Use of the VEXT command can produce unexpected results when operating in a non-Cartesian
            coordinate system. For a detailed description of the possible problems that may occur, see

        Returns
        -------
        int
            Volume number of the volume.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _VA_notes:

        This command conveniently allows generating volumes from regions having more than eight keypoints
        (which is not allowed with the :ref:`v` command). Areas may be input in any order. The exterior
        surface of a :ref:`va` volume must be continuous, but holes may pass completely through it.

        Examples
        --------
        Create a simple tetrahedral bounded by 4 areas.
