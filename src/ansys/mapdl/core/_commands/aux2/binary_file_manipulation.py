        Notes
        -----

        .. _COMBINE_notes:

        The :ref:`combine` command is used within the AUX2 auxiliary processor to combine local solution
        files from a distributed memory parallel solution into a single, global file. Before using this
        command, you must enter the AUX2 processor by issuing the :ref:`aux2` command.

        In a distributed-memory parallel ( DMP ) solution, you can use the :ref:`dmpoption` command to
        bypass the file combination step, causing all individual local files to be kept on the local disks
        in the current working directory. Later on, you can start a new distributed memory parallel solution
        and use the :ref:`combine` command to combine local files into a global file for a downstream
        solution or another operation (such as postprocessing with :ref:`post1` ). For example, the command
        :ref:`combine`,RST will combine local results files ( :file:`JobnameN.RST` ) into a global results
        file ( :file:`Jobname.RST` ).

        The :ref:`combine` command cannot be used to combine local files generated during a distributed
        memory parallel solution that used the frequency or cyclic harmonic index domain decomposition
        method ( :ref:`ddoption`,FREQ or :ref:`ddoption`,CYCHI).

        If :ref:`combine`,RNNN is specified, all of the multiframe restart files named :file:`Jobname.R001`
        to :file:`Jobname.R999` will automatically be combined. To combine only one set of :file:`.Rnnn`
        restart files, place only that set of restart files in your current working directory, or use the
        ``NUM`` argument to specify which set of :file:`.Rnnn` files to combine.

        When the :ref:`combine` command is used in a subsequent distributed memory parallel (DMP) session,
        the number of processors must be the same as in the DMP solution that generated the files.

        When running on a cluster, the local solution files must be available in the working directory on
        each node in the subsequent session. As an example, consider the following command line used to
        generate local solution files:

        .. code:: apdl

           ansys232 -dis -machines machine1: 4: machine2: 1: machine3: 2-i input -o output

        Different machines can be used in the subsequent session to combine these files. However, the total
        number of cores must remain unchanged (seven in the above case), and the local files must be copied
        to the working directory (or directories) on each of the machines used in the subsequent session.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. Defaults to the current Jobname if left blank.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). Defaults to :file:`.matrix` if left blank.

        form : str
            Specifies format of output matrix file:

            * ``ASCII`` - Write output matrix file in ASCII form.

            * ``BIN`` - Write output matrix file in binary form.

        matrx : str
            Specify which matrix to write to the output matrix file:

            * ``STIFF`` - Write stiffness matrix to output matrix file. Valid for all types of analyses that
              write a :file:`.full` file.

            * ``MASS`` - Write mass matrix to output matrix file. Valid for buckling, substructure, and modal
              analyses. If :file:`.full` file was generated in a buckling analysis, then this label will write
              stress stiffening matrix to output matrix file.

            * ``DAMP`` - Write damping matrix to output matrix file. Only valid for damped modal analyses.

        rhs : str
            Specifies whether to write the right-hand side vector to output matrix file:

            * ``YES`` - Write right-hand side vector to output matrix file.

            * ``NO`` - Do not write right-hand side vector to output matrix file.

        mapping : str
            Specifies whether to write the mapping file. This file is always named :file:`Fnamemapping`.

            * ``YES`` - Write the mapping file.

            * ``NO`` - Do not write the mapping file (default).

        -----

        .. _HBMAT_notes:

        This command copies a matrix from the assembled global matrix file ( :file:`.full` file) or from the
        superelement matrix file ( :file:`.sub` file) as specified on the :ref:`fileaux2` command and write
        it in Harwell-Boeing format to a new file named :file:`Jobname.matrix`. The Harwell-Boeing format is
        widely used by other applications that deal with matrices.

        The assembled global matrix file is created during solution depending on the analysis type, equation
        solver, and other solution options. By default, the assembled global matrix file is never deleted at
        the end of solution. For most analysis types, the Sparse direct solver and the ICCG solver will
        write a :file:`.full` file. All mode extraction methods used for buckling and modal analyses will
        write a properly formatted :file:`.full` file to be used with the :ref:`hbmat` command. However,
        when using distributed-memory parallel (DMP) processing, a majority of analyses will write a
        distributed (or local) form of the :file:`.full` file which is not currently supported by the
        :ref:`hbmat` command.

        When dumping the stiffness matrix for transient and harmonic analyses, be aware that the element
        mass matrix values (and possibly element damping matrix values) are incorporated into the globally
        assembled stiffness matrix. Thus, the globally assembled stiffness matrix represents more than the
        stiffness of the model for these analysis types. Please refer to the `Mechanical APDL Theory
        Reference <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_biblio.html>`_ for
        more details.

        When dumping a :file:`.full` file, the rows and columns corresponding to specified constraints (for
        example, :ref:`d` commands) are eliminated from the system of equations and therefore are not
        written to the :file:`.matrix` file. Also, rows and columns corresponding to eliminated (dependent)
        degrees of freedom from coupling and/or constraint equations (for example, :ref:`ce`, :ref:`cp`
        commands) are also eliminated from the system of equations and are not written to the
        :file:`.matrix` file. The DOFs that are eliminated from any coupling and/or constraint equations are
        determined internally by the solution code and may not match what you specified via the :ref:`ce` /
        :ref:`cp` (or similar) commands.

        When dumping a :file:`.sub` file, the full ``n`` x ``n`` matrix will be written to the
        :file:`.matrix` file for either symmetric or unsymmetric matrices, regardless of whether any of the
        matrix coefficients are zero-valued. When dumping a :file:`.full` file, only the lower triangular
        part of the matrix will be written to the :file:`.matrix` file if the matrix is symmetric; the full
        matrix is written if the matrix is unsymmetric. Only matrix coefficients that are greater than zero
        will be written.

        The Harwell-Boeing format is column-oriented. That is, non-zero matrix values are stored with their
        corresponding row indices in a sequence of columns. However, because the Mechanical APDL matrix
        files are
        stored by row and not column, when the :ref:`hbmat` command is used with a non-symmetric matrix, the
        transpose of the matrix is, in fact, written.

        The :ref:`wrfull` command, used with the :ref:`solve` command, generates the assembled global matrix
        file and eliminate the equation solution process and results output process.

        The mapping file can be used to map the matrix equation numbers found in the :file:`.matrix` file
        directly to the corresponding node numbers and degrees of freedom.

        When dumping a CMS :file:`.sub` file, the last rows/columns of the matrix are non-physical degrees
        of freedom added internally by the `CMS process
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_substr/advcms.html#advcmsunderstand>`_
        and cannot be mapped directly to a node number or particular degree of freedom.

            * ``COLOR`` - Each nonzero coefficient is symbolized by a colored square. The color depends on the

        This command is used to copy a matrix from the assembled global matrix file ( :file:`.FULL` file) as
        specified on the :ref:`file` command and write it in a postscript format to a new file named
        ``Fname``. ``Ext`` (defaults to :file:`Jobname.PS` ). The matrix is symbolized by a grid in which
        the black or colored squares represent the nonzero coefficients of the matrix. The :file:`.FULL`
        file must be available for this command to work properly.

        If the matrix is large, it may be difficult to display the postscript file. In this case, use
        ``Color`` = BLACK to reduce the postscript file size.

        The assembled global matrix file is created during solution depending on the analysis type, equation
        solver, and other solution options. By default, the assembled global matrix file is never deleted at
        the end of solution. For most analysis types, the Sparse direct solver and the ICCG solver write a
        :file:`.FULL` file. All mode extraction methods used for buckling and modal analyses write a
        properly formatted :file:`.FULL` file to be used with the :ref:`psmat` command.

        When copying the stiffness matrix for transient and harmonic analyses, be aware that the element
        mass matrix values (and possibly element damping matrix values) are incorporated into the globally
        assembled stiffness matrix. Thus, the globally assembled stiffness matrix represents more than the

        more details.

        The :ref:`psmat` command is not able to display a lumped mass matrix from a :file:`.FULL` file
        generated by a harmonic analysis.

        When copying a :file:`.FULL` file, the rows and columns corresponding to specified constraints (for
        example, :ref:`d` commands) are eliminated from the system of equations and therefore are not
        written to the :file:`.PS` file. In addition, rows and columns corresponding to eliminated
        (dependent) degrees of freedom from coupling and/or constraint equations (for example, :ref:`ce`,
        :ref:`cp` commands) are eliminated from the system of equations and are not written to the
        :file:`.PS` file. The DOFs that are eliminated from any coupling and/or constraint equations are
        determined internally by the solution code and may not match what you specified via the :ref:`ce` /
        :ref:`cp` (or similar) commands.

        When copying a :file:`.FULL` file, only the upper triangular part of the matrix will be written to
        the :file:`.PS` file if the matrix is symmetric; the full matrix is written if the matrix is
        unsymmetric. Only matrix coefficients that are greater than zero will be written.

        The :ref:`wrfull` command, in conjunction with the :ref:`solve` command, can be used to generate the
        assembled global matrix file and eliminate the equation solution process and results output process.

        The following command sequence shows typical usage of this command.
