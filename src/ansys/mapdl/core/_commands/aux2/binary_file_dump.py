        Enters the binary file-dumping processor (auxiliary processor AUX2), used for dumping the contents
        of certain Mechanical APDL binary files for visual examination.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nstrt : str
            Dump file from record ``NSTRT`` (defaults to 1) to ``NSTOP`` (defaults to ``NSTRT`` ). If
            ``NSTRT`` = HEAD, dump only record 1 of the file ( ``NSTOP`` and the format specification are
            ignored). If ``NSTRT`` = ALL, dump the entire file.

        nstop : str
            Dump file from record ``NSTRT`` (defaults to 1) to ``NSTOP`` (defaults to ``NSTRT`` ). If
            ``NSTRT`` = HEAD, dump only record 1 of the file ( ``NSTOP`` and the format specification are

        Mechanical APDL Command: `FILEAUX2 <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FILEAUX2.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. The file name defaults to the current
            :file:`Jobname` if ``Ident`` is specified.

        ident : str
            File name identifier. See the `Basic Analysis Guide
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS19.html>`_ for file
            descriptions and identifiers. If not an identifier, the program uses ``Ident`` as the file name
            extension.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : str
            Dump the file record starting at pointer ``LOC``. ``BASE`` is the base pointer, and would be

        loch : str
