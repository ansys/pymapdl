        Parameters
        ----------
        nvar
            Arbitrary reference number assigned to this variable (2 to NV
            [NUMVAR]). Overwrites any existing results for this variable.

        node
            Node number for which data are to be stored.

        item
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in
            Table 126: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels below. Some
            items also require a component label.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are
            shown in Table 126: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels
            below.

        name
            Thirty-two character name for identifying the item on the printout
            and displays. Defaults to an eight character label formed by
            concatenating the first four characters of the Item and Comp
            labels.

        mat
            The material number. Average will be computed based on the subset
            of elements with the specified material number. DEFAULT: Use all
            elements in the active set unless Real and/or Ename is specified.

        real
            The real number. Average will be computed based on the subset of
            elements with the specified real number. DEFAULT: Use all elements
            in the active set unless Mat and/or Ename is specified.

        ename
            The element type name. Average will be computed based on the subset
            of elements with the specified element type name. DEFAULT: Use all
            elements in the active set unless Mat and/or Real is specified.

        Notes
        -----
        Valid item and component labels for averaged nodal results are listed
        in Table: 126:: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels, below.

        All element nodal quantities are obtained in RSYS, Solu and then
        averaged.

        The ANSOL command defines averaged nodal results data to be stored from
        a results file [FILE]. Not all items are valid for all nodes. See the
        input and output summary tables of the Element Reference of each
        element that is attached to the node for the available items.

        COORDINATE SYSTEMS: All element nodal results used by ANSOL for
        averaging are in the element coordinate system, except for layered
        elements. Layered element results are in the layer coordinate system.
        You can further specify the element nodal results, for some elements,
        with the SHELL, LAYERP26, and FORCE commands.

        ANSOL does not transform results from RSYS, SOLU to other coordinate
        systems. Verify that all elements attached to the subject node have the
        same coordinate system before using ANSOL.

        SHELL ELEMENTS: The default shell element coordinate system is based on
        node ordering. For shell elements the adjacent elements could have a
        different RSYS,SOLU, making the resultant averaged data inconsistent. A
        note to this effect is issued when ANSOL is used in models containing
        shell elements. Ensure that consistent coordinate systems are active
        for all associated elements used by the ANSOL command.

        DERIVED QUANTITIES: Some of the result items supported by ANSOL (see
        Table: 126:: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels) are derived
        from the component quantities. Use AVPRIN to specify the principal and
        vector sum quantity averaging methods.

        DEFAULT: If Mat, Real , and Ename are not specified, all of the
        elements attached to the node will be considered. When a material ID,
        real constant ID, or element type discontinuity is detected at a node,
        a note is issued. For example, in a FSI analysis, a FLUID30 element at
        the structure interface would be considered. But since it contains no
        SX result, it will not be used during STORE operations.

            Number identifying the data set to be read in (defaults to 1). If
            Label = GLSTAT, NUM is ignored. If Label = MATSUM or RBDOUT, NUM is
            the PART number [EDPART] for which output is desired. If Label =

            Load step range of data to be read in. If STEP1 and STEP2 are
            blank, all load steps are read in.

        Notes
        -----
        EDREAD reads data from the specified ascii output file so that it may
        be used during postprocessing. After EDREAD, you must issue the STORE
        command to store the data in time history variables. Once stored, the
        variables can be viewed as plots of output item versus time.

        The number of variables stored depends on the file specified. The
        following table shows the items in each file and the order in which
        they are stored.  If data items were previously stored in variables
        NSTART to NSTART+15, they will be overwritten. If more variables are
        needed, change NV on the NUMVAR command. (Note that hourglass energy
        will not be available if it was not specified for the model
        [EDENERGY,1].)

        The following items under MATSUM are listed in the MATSUM ASCII file
        (in the Mat no. field) for each part number at time intervals specified
        by the EDHTIME command. Use EDREAD,,MATSUM,NUM to specify the part
        number that corresponds to the mat number in the MATSUM file.

        Resultant contact forces and sliding interface energies are available
        from the RCFORC and SLEOUT files, respectively. The RCFORC file is
        written for surface based contact types that include target and contact
        (master and slave) definitions.  You should ensure that this file
        contains valid force results before issuing EDREAD,,RCFORC. Only the
        resultant contact forces on the master surface are available for time-
        history postprocessing.

        Notes
        -----
        See Table: 134:: ESOL - General Item and Component Labels for
        a list of valid item and component labels for element (except
        line element) results.

        The ESOL command defines element results data to be stored
        from a results file (FILE). Not all items are valid for all
        elements. To see the available items for a given element,
        refer to the input and output summary tables in the
        documentation for that element.

        Two methods of data access are available via the ESOL
        command. You can access some simply by using a generic label
        (component name method), while others require a label and
        number (sequence number method).

        Use the component name method to access general element data
        (that is, element data generally available to most element
        types or groups of element types).

        The sequence number method is required for data that is not
        averaged (such as pressures at nodes and temperatures at
        integration points), or data that is not easily described in a
        generic fashion (such as all derived data for structural line
        elements and contact elements, all derived data for thermal
        line elements, and layer data for layered elements).

        Element results are in the element coordinate system, except
        for layered elements where results are in the layer coordinate
        system.  Element forces and moments are in the nodal
        coordinate system. Results are obtainable for an element at a
        specified node. Further location specifications can be made
        for some elements via the SHELL, LAYERP26, and FORCE commands.

        possible values, see Reviewing Results in POST1 in the Contact
        Technology Guide.

            this variable.

        node
            Node for which data are to be stored.

        item
            Label identifying the item.  Valid item labels are shown in the
            table below.  Some items also require a component label.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required).  Valid component labels are

        Stores nodal degree of freedom and solution results in a variable. For
        more information, see Data Interpreted in the Nodal Coordinate System
        in the Modeling and Meshing Guide.

        For SECTOR>1, the result is in the nodal coordinate system of the base
        sector, and it is rotated to the expanded sector’s location. Refer to
        Using the /CYCEXPAND Command in the Cyclic Symmetry Analysis Guide for
        more information.

                  result file specifications and deleting any previously-
                  calculated (OPER) variables. Variables defined using the
                  ANSOL command are also deleted.

            APPEN - Append data from results file to the existing data.

            ALLOC - Allocate (and zero) space for NPTS data points.

            PSD - Create a new set of frequency points for PSD calculations (replacing any
                  previously stored data and erasing any previously calculated
                  data).

        npts
            The number of time points (or frequency points) for storage (used
            only with Lab = ALLOC or PSD).  The value may be input when using
            POST26 with data supplied from other than a results file.  This
            value is automatically determined from the results file data with
            the NEW, APPEN, and MERGE options.  For the PSD option, NPTS
            determines the resolution of the frequency vector (valid numbers
