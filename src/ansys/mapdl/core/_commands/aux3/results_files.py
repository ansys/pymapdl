            * ``0`` - Keep the original title.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _MODIFY_notes:

        Use this command to change the listed values in a data set in a results file. Using this command
        does not change any actual model data; it affects only the values listed in the results file.

        The :ref:`modify` command is valid only in the results file editing processor (auxiliary processor
        AUX3), and, like the other AUX3 commands, it only affects the data steps index (DSI), time (TIM),
        loadstep, substep and cumulative step iteration (LSP) records in the results file.

        **Example Usage**
        If you start with the following results file:

        .. code:: apdl

           SET   TIME/FREQ    LOAD STEP   SUBSTEP  CUMULATIVE
            1     1.0000          1          1         1
            first load set

            2     2.0000           2          1         2
            second load set

            3     3.0000           3          1         3
            third load set

            4     4.0000           4          1         4
            fourth load set

        and you then issue the following commands:

        .. code:: apdl

           /title, modified title for set number 3
           modify,3,5,2,5,4.5,1

        The modified results file would look like this:

        .. code:: apdl

           SET   TIME/FREQ    LOAD STEP   SUBSTEP  CUMULATIVE
            1     1.0000          1          1         1
            first load set

            2     2.0000           2          1         2
            second load set

            3     4.5000           5          2         5
            modified title for set number 3

            4     4.0000           4          1         4
            fourth load set

        Parameters
        ----------
        option : str
            Specifies which sets are to be removed from the selected sets.

            * ``SET`` - Specifies one or more particular sets in the results file that are to be removed from
              the group of sets selected for deletion.

            * ``ALL`` - Removes all selected sets that are currently selected for deletion.

        nstart : str
            The first set to be removed from the set selected for deletion.

        nend : str
            The final set to be removed from the set selected for deletion. This field is used only if
            operating on more than one sequential set.
