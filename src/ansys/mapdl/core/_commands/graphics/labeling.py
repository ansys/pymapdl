        r"""Controls graphics options on subsequent displays.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `/PLOPTS <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_PLOPTS.html>`_

        **Command default:**

        .. _s-PLOPTS_default:

        See individual label defaults.

        The Multi-legend mode ( :ref:`plopts`,INFO,3) is the default for contour legend displays.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            Apply display items as selected from the following labels:

            * ``INFO`` - Controls the display of the legend (ON or OFF) and allows the choice of preset or
              Multi-legend placement. Control is provided by the ``KEY`` values. (Defaults to ``KEY`` =3 when the
              GUI is on. Defaults to ``KEY`` = 2 otherwise.)

            * ``LEG1`` - Header portion of legend column (defaults to ON).

            * ``LEG2`` - View portion of legend column (defaults to ON (except off with contour displays)).

            * ``LEG3`` - View the contour section of the legend column (defaults to ON).

            * ``FRAME`` - Frame border lines around windows (defaults to ON).

            * ``TITLE`` - Title (bottom left text) (defaults to ON).

            * ``MINM`` - Min-Max symbols on contour displays (defaults to ON).

            * ``LOGO`` - Ansys logo (defaults to OFF (displayed as text at top of legend column)). If
              ``KEY`` = ON, the text is removed from legend column but the logo symbol is displayed in whichever
              active window is either in the uppermost right corner and on top, or if there is no window in that
              location, then in the window to the furthest right of the screen. Version information remains in the
              legend column.

            * ``WINS`` - Controls whether graphics windows automatically stretch or shrink to adjust to screen
              size as the legend column is turned off or on ( :ref:`plopts`,INFO) (defaults to ON). If WINS is on
              and the legend column is changed from off to on, all windows are shrunk regardless of what their
              correct size is.

            * ``WP`` - Working plane (defaults to OFF). The working plane is drawn as part of the display ( not
              just an overlaid image as in :ref:`wpstyl` ). This option is best used in combination with a hidden-
              line technique ( :ref:`slashtype` ).

            * ``DATE`` - Controls the display of the date and time in your legend. Subsequent ``KEY`` values control the display as follows:

              * 0 â No date or time displays are included in your legend.
              * 1 â Only the date is shown.
              * 2 â Both the date and time are shown (default).

            * ``FILE`` - Controls the display of the Mechanical APDL jobname in your legend. Subsequent ``KEY`` values control the display as follows:

              * 0 â The Mechanical APDL jobname is not included in your legend (default).
              * 1 â The Mechanical APDL jobname is included in your legend.

        key : int or str
            Switch:

            * ``OFF or 0`` - Do not apply this display item. For ``Label`` = DATE, no time or date are
              displayed.

            * ``ON or 1`` - Apply this display item. For ``Label`` = DATE, show only the date.

            * ``AUTO or 2`` - For ``Label`` = INFO, initiate Auto-legend mode. If the display has contours, the
              legend is ON; if the display has no contours, the legend is OFF. For ``Label`` = DATE, display both
              the date and time.

            * ``3`` - For ``Label`` = INFO, switch to Multi-legend mode. See the :ref:`udoc` command for the
              available legend configurations.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-PLOPTS_notes:

        Use :ref:`plopts`,STAT to display settings. Use :ref:`plopts`,DEFA to reset all specifications back
        to their defaults.

        When you perform multiple results displays, contours on the legend column may be truncated. To avoid
        this, specify :ref:`plopts`,LEG1,0.

        The Multi-legend mode provides a number of legend data item priority and placement options. These
        options are accessed via the GUI at Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Window Controls> Window Options. The
        :ref:`udoc` command provides command line o  ptions for this capability.

        .. _s-PBC_notes:

        The **/PBC** command adds degree of freedom constraint, force load, and other symbols to displays.

        Symbols are applied to the selected nodes only. All arrow and arrowhead symbols are oriented in the
        nodal coordinate system and lie in two perpendicular planes. Force arrows are scaled proportional to
        their magnitude. (If ``KEY`` = 1, use :ref:`vscale` to change arrow length.) For scalar quantities,
        the specific component direction (that is, x, y, or z) of the symbol has no meaning, but the
        positive or negative sense (for example, positive or negative x) represents a positive or negative
        scalar value, respectively.

        The effects of the **/PBC** command are not cumulative (that is, the command does not modify an
        existing setting from a
        previously issued **/PBC** command). If you issue multiple **/PBC** commands during an analysis,
        only the setting specified by the most recent :ref:`pbc` command applies.

        Use :ref:`pstatus` or :ref:`pbc`,STAT to display settings. Use :ref:`pbc`,DEFA to reset all
        specifications back to default. See the :ref:`psf` and :ref:`pbf` commands for other display

            * ``1`` - On, shown as face outlines. Line surface loads ( :ref:`sfl` ) on solid model plots are

            * ``2`` - On, shown as arrows.

            * ``3`` - On, shown as color filled surfaces. Line and area surface loads ( :ref:`sfl` and
              :ref:`sfa` ) on solid model plots are shown as arrows.

        kshell : int or str
            Visibility key for shell elements.

            * ``0`` - Off (default), surface load symbols are displayed only on visible load faces.

            * ``1`` - On, surface load symbols are displayed even if load face is not visible.

        color : str
            Visibility key for contour legend.

            * ``ON`` - The symbols (arrows or face outlines) will show up in color with the legend showing the
              corresponding color labels (default).

            * ``OFF`` - The contour legend will not be displayed. The symbols (arrows or face outlines) will
              show up in grey. The size of the arrows will be proportional to the applied load.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-PSF_notes:

        :ref:`psf` determines whether and how to show surface loads on subsequent model displays.

        If surface loads are applied to solid model entities, only solid model plots show the load symbols;
        node and element plots do not show them unless the loads are transferred ( :ref:`sftran` or
        :ref:`sbctran` ). Similarly, solid model plots do not show the load symbols if surface loads are
        applied to nodes and elements. For node and element plots of shell element models, the surface load
        symbols are shown only if the load face is visible from the current viewing direction.

        The effects of the **/PSF** command are not cumulative (that is, the command does not modify an
        existing setting from a
        previously issued :ref:`psf` command). Only the setting specified via the most recent :ref:`psf`
        command applies.

        If you issue a `postprocessing (POST1)
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cmd/Hlp_C_CH2_7.html#cmdpost1failure>`_
        plot command that produces result contours (such as :ref:`plnsol` ), :ref:`psf` has no effect. This
        behavior prevents conflicting contours in the graphics window.

        When using the radiosity method ( ``Item`` = RDSF and ``Comp`` = ENCL) with ``Key`` = 2, the
        radiation arrows point outward from any element face.

        :ref:`psf`,STAT displays current :ref:`psf` settings, and :ref:`psf`,DEFA resets them back to
        default.

        Other useful commands are :ref:`pnum`,SVAL,1 to show the values of the surface loads, :ref:`vscale`
        to change arrow lengths, and :ref:`pbc` and :ref:`pbf` to activate other load symbols.

        For beam elements, only the colors representing shear (GREEN) and normal (RED) pressures are
        displayed for the arrows. The color of these arrows does not correspond to the magnitudes in the
        contour legend. The length of these arrows does, however, correlate to the relative magnitude of the
        pressures.

        For elements ``SURF159``, ``SOLID272``, ``SOLID273``, ``PIPE288``and ``PIPE289``, :ref:`psf` is not
        available when displaying elements with shapes determined from the real constants or section
        definition ( :ref:`eshape` ). For ``PIPE288``and ``PIPE289``, only external loads applied via
        :ref:`sfbeam` are displayed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            Show symbols as selected from the following labels:

            * ``CS`` - Local coordinate systems.

            * ``NDIR`` - Nodal coordinate systems (on rotated nodes only).

            * ``ESYS`` - Element coordinate systems (element displays only).

            * ``LDIR`` - Line directions (line displays only).

            * ``LDIV`` - Controls the display of element divisions on lines.

            * ``ADIR`` - Area direction symbol (for keypoint, line, area and volume plots).

            * ``LAYR`` - Layer orientations (relative to the projected element x-axis) or fiber orientations in
              smeared reinforcing elements. Used only within an element display. Use ``KEY`` to specify the layer
              number.

            * ``ECON`` - Element mesh symbols on keypoints and lines.

            * ``DOT`` - Larger symbols displayed for node and keypoint locations. When ``Label`` = DOT, ``KEY``
              = 1 by default.

            * ``XNOD`` - Extra node of surface or circuit elements.

            * ``FBCS`` - Force boundary condition scaling. Subsequent ``KEY`` value determines whether or not to
              scale the applied and derived forces/moments to the same maximum value.

            * ``DEFA`` - Resets the symbol keys so that Mechanical APDL displays none of the symbols controlled by the
              :ref:`psymb` command. The value of the ``KEY`` field is ignored.

            * ``STAT`` - Prints the status of the settings of the symbol keys controlled by the :ref:`psymb`
              command. The ``KEY`` field is ignored.

            * ``MARK`` - Controls the marker size ( :ref:`gmarker` ). When ``Label`` = MARK, ``KEY`` = 10 by
              default.

        key : int or str
            Symbol key:

            * ``-1`` - Effective only if ``Label`` = LAYR and solid shape element display ( :ref:`eshape` ) is
              active. Orientation of all layers appears with the solid shape element display.

            * ``0`` - No symbol (default). If ``Label`` = LDIV, then ``KEY`` = 0 indicates that the displayed
              element divisions will correspond to the existing mesh (the word MESHED or EXISTING can also be
              substituted). Also, for ``Label`` = LDIV, if you execute any meshing command (such as :ref:`amesh`
              or :ref:`vmesh` ), ``KEY`` is set to 0 (MESHED) automatically. If ``Label`` = FBCS, then ``KEY`` = 0
              indicates that boundary condition scaling will not be common. The applied and derived forces/moments
              will be scaled to their respective maximum values.

            * ``1`` - Include symbol. If ``Label`` = LDIV, then ``KEY`` = 1 indicates that the displayed line
              divisions will correspond to the value assigned by :ref:`lesize` (the word LESIZE can also be
              substituted). Also, for ``Label`` = LDIV, if you execute the :ref:`lesize` command, ``KEY`` is set
              to 1 (LESIZE) automatically. If ``Label`` = FBCS, then ``KEY`` = 1 indicates that boundary condition
              scaling will be common. The applied and derived forces/moments will be scaled to the same maximum
              value.

            * ``N`` - If ``Label`` = LAYR, then ``N`` is equal to the layer number. If ``Label`` = DOT, then
              ``N`` can be equal to 0,1,.....15, indicating the dot size. If ``Label`` = MARK, then ``N`` can be
              equal to 1,.....10, indicating the marker size. If ``Label`` = LDIV, then ``KEY`` = -1, indicates that
              no element divisions will be displayed (the word OFF can also be substituted).

        Includes various symbols on the display. Triads are right-handed with x displayed as the longest
        leg. Where color is displayed, x is white, y is green, and z is blue. For beams, x is always along
        the length of the element. For lines, an arrow represents the direction of a line, from the
        beginning keypoint to the end keypoint. See :ref:`plopts` command for additional display options.
        Use :ref:`pstatus` or :ref:`psymb`,STAT to display settings. Use :ref:`psymb`,DEFA to reset all
        specifications back to their defaults. The command :ref:`psymb`,ECON,1 causes the symbol "M" to be
        displayed on keypoints and lines associated with meshed entities. When you issue the command
        :ref:`psymb`,DOT,1, a larger symbol is displayed for each node and keypoint location. Using
        :ref:`psymb`,MARK,1, a smaller marker size can be displayed.

        PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER) does not support :ref:`psymb`,ESYS and :ref:`psymb`,LAYR.

        If ``KEY`` = ``N`` and PowerGraphics is off, the centroid of the surface elements is connected to
        the extra node using a gray line. However, if PowerGraphics is on, the color of the line connecting
        the centroid to the extra node is the same as that for the elements themselves (as determined by
        :ref:`pnum` ).

        When ``Label`` = LAYR, the layer systems can be visualized with all current-technology layered
        elements and the smeared reinforcing element ``REINF265``. To use :ref:`psymb`,LAYR with
        ``REINF265``, first set the vector-mode graphics option ( :ref:`device`,VECTOR,1).

        .. _s-PNUM_notes:

        This command specifies entity numbering and coloring for subsequent plots.

        The MAT, TYPE, REAL, and ESYS labels activate both the numbering and coloring of the corresponding

        MAT, TYPE, REAL, ESYS, and LOC labels are mutually exclusive, that is, only one can be specified at
        a time. Also, turning on a LINE, AREA, or VOLU label will turn off the MAT, TYPE, and REAL labels.

        PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER) displays for :ref:`pnum` can be problematic. :ref:`pnum`,ELEM

        When you suppress color ( ``NKEY`` = -1) your contour plots will produce different results,
        depending on your graphics equipment. For non-3D devices (X11, Win32, etc.) your contour plot will
        be white (no color). For 3D devices, such as OpenGL, the resulting display will be in color.

        The following items are automatically given discrete colors: Boundary condition symbols ( :ref:`pbc`
        ), curves on graph displays, and distorted geometry on postprocessing displays. Contour lines in
        postprocessing displays are automatically colored based upon a continuous, rather than a discrete,
        spectrum so that red is associated with the highest contour value. On terminals with raster
        capability ( :ref:`show` ), the area between contour lines is filled with the color of the higher
        contour.

        Explicit entity colors or the discrete color mapping may be changed with the :ref:`color` command.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn : str
            Window number (or ALL) to which command applies (defaults to 1).

        ncont : str
            Number of contour values. ``NCONT`` defaults to 9 for X11 or WIN32 and to 128 for X11c or
            WIN32C. The default graphics window display for 3D devices is a smooth continuous shading effect
            that spans the maximum of 128 contours available. Use the :ref:`dv3d` command to create defined
            banding for your contour values (values of 9 and 128 are displayed in smooth shading only). The
            legend, however, will display only nine color boxes, which span the full range of colors
            displayed in the graphics window.

        vmin : str
            Minimum contour value. If ``VMIN`` = AUTO, automatically calculate contour values based upon
            ``NCONT`` uniformly spaced values over the min-max extreme range. Or, if ``VMIN`` = USER, set
            contour values to those of the last display (useful when last display automatically calculated
            contours).

        vinc : str
            Value increment (positive) between contour values. Defaults to ( ``VMAX`` - ``VMIN`` )
            ``/NCONT``.

        vmax : str
            Maximum contour value. Ignored if both ``VMIN`` and ``VINC`` are specified.

        -----

        .. _s-CONTOUR_notes:

        Values represent contour lines in vector mode, and the algebraic maximum of contour bands in raster
        mode.

        Regardless of how many contours ( ``NCONT`` ) are specified, the actual number of contours appearing
        on your display depends also on the device name, whether the display is directed to the screen or to
        a file, the display mode (vector or raster), and the number of color planes. (All of those items are
        controlled via :ref:`show`.) In any case, regardless of whether they are smoothed or banded, only
        128 contours can be displayed.

        For more information about changing the number of contours, see `Creating Geometric Results Displays
