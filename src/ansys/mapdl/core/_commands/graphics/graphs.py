    def gropt(self, lab: str = "", key: str = "", **kwargs):
        r"""Sets various line graph display options.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `/GROPT <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_GROPT.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Apply display style as selected from the following labels:

            * ``AXDV`` - Axis division (tick) marks (defaults to ``KEY`` = ON).

            * ``AXNM`` - Axis scale numbers (defaults to ``KEY`` = ON, which puts numbers at the back plane of
              the graph). If ``KEY`` = FRONT, numbers are on the front plane of the graph.

            * ``AXNSC`` - Axis number size scale factor. Input the scale value for ``KEY`` (defaults to 1.0).

            * ``ASCAL`` - Automatic scaling of additional Y-axes for multi-curve ( :ref:`grtyp`, 2 or 3) graphs
              (defaults to ``KEY`` = ON). If ``KEY`` = OFF, use base Y-axis scaling (see the :ref:`yrange`
              command).

            * ``LOGX`` - Log X scale (defaults to ``KEY`` = OFF (linear)).

            * ``LOGY`` - Log Y scale (applies only to the base Y axis) (defaults to ``KEY`` = OFF (linear)).

            * ``FILL`` - Color fill areas under curves (defaults to ``KEY`` = OFF).

            * ``CGRID`` - Superimpose background grid ( :ref:`grid` ) over areas under filled curves (defaults
              to ``KEY`` = OFF).

            * ``DIG1`` - Number of significant digits before decimal point for axis values. Input the value for
              ``KEY`` (defaults to 4).

            * ``DIG2`` - Number of significant digits after decimal point for axis values. Input the value for
              ``KEY`` (defaults to 3).

            * ``VIEW`` - View key for graph displays (defaults to ``KEY`` = OFF, in which case the view is
              (0,0,1) for 2D graph displays or (1,2,3) for 3D graph displays). If ``KEY`` = ON, the view settings
              for graph displays are the same as the view settings for the model.

            * ``REVX`` - Plots the values on the X-axis in reverse order.

            * ``REVY`` - Plots the values on the Y-axis in reverse order.

            * ``DIVX`` - Determines the number of divisions (grid markers) that will be plotted on the X axis.

            * ``DIVY`` - Determines the number of divisions (grid markers) that will be plotted on the Y axis.

            * ``LTYP`` - Specifies whether program-generated ( ``KEY`` = 1) or system-derived ( ``KEY`` = 0)
              fonts are used for the axis labels.

            * ``CURL`` - Determines the position of the curve labels. If ( ``KEY`` = 1), the curve label will be
              plotted in the legend column, and the label will be displayed in the same color as the curve. If (
              ``KEY`` = 0) the curve labels will be plotted near the curve. (default).

            * ``XAXO`` - When you use this label, the subsequent ``KEY`` value will determine an offset amount
              from the default (along the bottom) location for the X axis. If ``KEY`` = 1.0, a full offset occurs
              (the X axis is moved to the top of the graph). If ``KEY`` = 0.5, the axis is offset to the midpoint
              of the graph, and if ``KEY`` = 0 the axis remains in the original position, along the bottom of the
              graph. For any offset, a grey copy of the original axis (containing the axis numbering) remains at
              the original location.

            * ``YAXO`` - When you use this label, the subsequent ``KEY`` value will determine an offset amount
              from the default (along the left side of the graph) location for the Y axis. If ``KEY`` = 1.0, a
              full offset occurs (the Y axis is moved to the right side of the graph). If ``KEY`` = 0.5, the axis
              is offset to the midpoint of the graph, and if ``KEY`` = 0 the axis remains in the original
              position, along the left side of the graph. For any offset, a gray copy of the original axis
              (containing the axis numbering) remains at the original location.

        key : str
            Option values:

            * ``OFF (0)`` - Do not apply selected style.

            * ``ON (1)`` - Apply selected style.

            * ``nnnn`` - If ``Lab`` is DIG1 or DIG2, input the number of digits.

            * ``nn`` - If ``Lab`` is AXNSC, input the scale factor.

            * ``FRONT`` - If ``Lab`` is AXNM, FRONT may also be input.

            * ``Ndiv`` - If ``Lab`` is DIVX or DIVY, determines the number of divisions (1-99) that will be
              applied to the axis.

            * ``Kfont`` - If ``Lab`` is LTYP, ``Kfont`` is ON (1) or OFF(0). ON uses program-generated fonts for
              the axis labels, while OFF uses SYSTEM (Windows, X-system, etc.) fonts. Default: ``Kfont`` = ON
              (Mechanical APDL fonts).

        .. _s-GROPT_notes:

        Sets various line graph display options. Issue :ref:`gropt`,STAT to display the current settings.

        Issue :ref:`gropt`,DEFA to reset default specifications.

        Unless you issue :ref:`gropt`,VIEW,ON, the program indicates that graph-view manipulation is
        inactive.

        See :ref:`axlab`, :ref:`grtyp`, :ref:`grid`, and :ref:`gthk` for other graph-control options.

        Automatic scaling using the :ref:`xrange` and :ref:`yrange` commands often yields inappropriate
        range values for logarithmic scales ( :ref:`gropt`, LOGX or :ref:`gropt`, LOGY).

        This command is valid in any processor.

            * ``CURVE`` - Modify thickness of curve lines (when no area fill ( :ref:`gropt` )).

        thick : int or str
            Thickness ratio (whole numbers only, from -1 to 10):

            * ``-1`` - Do not draw the curve, but show only the markers specified by :ref:`gmarker`.

            * ``0 or 1`` - Thin lines.

            * ``2`` - The default thickness.

            * ``2`` - Additional Y-axes (one for each curve) (3 curves maximum). Allows better scaling of curves
              with widely differing numbering ranges.

            * ``3`` - Same as 2 but with additional Y-axis and curves projected out of the plane (6 curves
