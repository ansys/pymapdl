            * ``1`` - Use initial thickness in the displaced solid shape display of shell elements.

        Notes
        -----
        The /ESHAPE command allows beams, shells, current sources, and
        certain special-purpose elements to be displayed as solids
        with the shape determined from the real constants or section
        types. Elements are displayed via the EPLOT command. No checks
        for valid or complete input are made for the display.

        Following are details about using this command with various
        element types:

        SOLID65 elements are displayed with internal lines that
        represent rebar sizes and orientations (requires vector mode
        [/DEVICE] with a basic type of display [/TYPE,,BASIC]). The
        rebar with the largest volume ratio in each element plots as a
        red line, the next largest as green, and the smallest as blue.

        COMBIN14, COMBIN39, and MASS21 are displayed with a graphics
        icon, with the offset determined by the real constants and
        KEYOPT settings.

        BEAM188, BEAM189, PIPE288, PIPE289 and ELBOW290 are displayed
        as solids with the shape determined via the section-definition
        commands (SECTYPE and SECDATA). The arbitrary section option
        (Subtype = ASEC) has no definite shape and appears as a thin
        rectangle to show orientation. The elements are displayed with
        internal lines representing the cross- section mesh.

        SOLID272 and SOLID273 are displayed as solids with the shape
        determined via the section-definition commands (SECTYPE and
        SECDATA).  The 2-D master plane is revolved around the
        prescribed axis of symmetry.

        Contour plots are available for these elements in
        postprocessing for PowerGraphics only (/GRAPHICS,POWER). To
        view 3-D deformed shapes for the elements, issue OUTRES,MISC
        or OUTRES,ALL for static or transient analyses. To view 3-D
        mode shapes for a modal or eigenvalue buckling analysis,
        expand the modes with element results calculation ON (Elcalc =
        YES for MXPAND).

        SOURC36, CIRCU124, and TRANS126 elements always plot using
        /ESHAPE when PowerGraphics is activated (/GRAPHICS,POWER).

        In most cases, /ESHAPE renders a thickness representation of
        your shell, plane and layered elements more readily in
        PowerGraphics (/GRAPHICS,POWER). This type of representation
        employs PowerGraphics to generate the enhanced representation,
        and will often provide no enhancement in Full Graphics
        (/GRAPHICS,FULL). This is especially true for POST1 results
        displays, where /ESHAPE is not supported for most element
        types with FULL graphics.

        When PowerGraphics is active, /ESHAPE may degrade the image if
        adjacent elements have overlapping material, such as shell
        elements which are not co-planar. Additionally, if adjacent
        elements have different thicknesses, the polygons depicting
        the connectivity between the "thicker" and "thinner" elements
        along the shared element edges may not always be displayed.

        For POST1 results displays (such as PLNSOL), the following
        limitations apply:

        Rotational displacements for beam elements are used to create
        a more realistic displacement display. When /ESHAPE is active,
        displacement plots (via PLNSOL,U,X and PLDISP, for example)
        may disagree with your PRNSOL listings. This discrepancy will
        become more noticeable when the SCALE value is not equal to
        one.

        When shell elements are not co-planar, the resulting PLNSOL
        display with /ESHAPE will actually be a PLESOL display as the
        non-coincident pseudo-nodes are not averaged. Additionally,
        /ESHAPE should not be used with coincident elements because
        the plot may incorrectly average the displacements of the
        coincident elements.

        When nodes are initially coincident and PowerGraphics is
        active, duplicate polygons are eliminated to conserve display
        time and disk space. The command may degrade the image if
        initially coincident nodes have different displacements. The
        tolerance for determining coincidence is 1E-9 times the
        model``s bounding box diagonal.

        If you want to view solution results (PLNSOL, etc.) on layered
        elements (such as SHELL181, SOLSH190, SOLID185 Layered Solid,
        SOLID186 Layered Solid, SHELL208, SHELL209, SHELL281, and
        ELBOW290), set KEYOPT(8) = 1 for the layer elements so that
        the data for all layers is stored in the results file.

        You can plot the through-thickness temperatures of elements
        SHELL131 and SHELL132 regardless of the thermal DOFs in use by
        issuing the PLNSOL,TEMP command (with PowerGraphics and
        /ESHAPE active).

        The /ESHAPE,1 and /ESHAPE,FAC commands are incompatible with
        the /CYCEXPAND command used in cyclic symmetry analyses.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        .. _s-EDGE_notes:

        The ``ANGLE`` field is used in PowerGraphics to determine geometric discontinuities. It is a

        within the tolerance are accepted as coplanar (geometrically continuous). In postprocessing
        displays, results are not averaged across discontinuous surfaces.

        A surface can be displayed as an edge outline without interior detail. This is useful for both
        geometry and postprocessing displays. Element outlines are normally shown as solid lines for
        geometry and displacement displays. Lines common to adjacent "coplanar" element faces are removed
        from the display. Midside nodes of elements are ignored.

        .. _s-TXTRE_notes:

        This command is available for 3D Open GL devices. 2D devices are supported **only** for the ``Lab``
        = File variation of the command, allowing imported bitmaps to be used for texturing and annotation.
        Textures can affect the speed of many of your display operations. You can increase the speed by
        temporarily turning the textures off ( Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> Style> Texturing(3D)> Display
        Texturing ). This menu selection toggles your textures on and off. When textures are toggled off,
        all of the
        texture information is retained and reapplied when texturing is toggled back on.

        For some displays, the texture will appear distorted because of a technique used to enhance 3D
        displays ( :ref:`dv3d`,TRIS,1). Disabling this function ( :ref:`dv3d`,TRIS,0) will improve the
        quality of some texture displays. Disabling the TRIS option of the :ref:`dv3d` command will slow
        down 3D displays significantly. Be sure to reapply the TRIS option after you obtain a satisfactory
        output.

        Specifying :ref:`txtre`,DEFA removes all texturing.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn : str
            Window number (or ALL) to which command applies (defaults to 1).

        type_ : str
            Display type. Defaults to ZBUF for raster mode displays or BASIC for vector mode displays:

            * ``BASIC or 0`` - Basic display (no hidden or section operations).

            * ``SECT or 1`` - Section display (plane view). Use the :ref:`cplane` command to define the cutting plane.

            * ``HIDC or 2`` - Centroid hidden display (based on item centroid sort).

            * ``HIDD or 3`` - Face hidden display (based on face centroid sort).

            * ``HIDP or 4`` - Precise hidden display (like HIDD but with more precise checking). Because all facets are sorted,
              this mode can be extremely slow, especially for large models.

            * ``CAP or 5`` - Capped hidden display (same as combined SECT and HIDD with model in front of section plane removed).

            * ``ZBUF or 6`` - Z-buffered display (like HIDD but using software Z-buffering).

            * ``ZCAP or 7`` - Capped Z-buffered display (same as combined SECT and ZBUF with model in front of section plane
              removed).

            * ``ZQSL or 8`` - QSLICE Z-buffered display (same as SECT but the edge lines of the remaining 3D model are shown).

            * ``HQSL or 9`` - QSLICE precise hidden display (like ZQSL but using precise hidden).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-TYPE_notes:

        Defines the type of display, such as section display or hidden-line display. Use the :ref:`device`
        command to specify either raster or vector mode.

        The SECT, CAP, ZCAP, ZQSL, and HQSL options produce section displays. The section or "cutting" plane
        is specified on the :ref:`cplane` command as either normal to the viewing vector at the focus point
        (default), or as the working plane.

        When you use PowerGraphics, the section display options (Section, Slice, and Capped) use different
        averaging techniques for the interior and exterior results. Because of the different averaging
        schemes, anomalies may appear at the transition areas. In many cases, the automatically computed MIN
        and MAX values will differ from the full range of interior values. You can lessen the effect of
        these anomalies by issuing :ref:`avres`,,FULL ( Main Menu> General Post Proc> Options for Outp ).
        This command sets your legend's automatic contour interval range according to the minimum and
        maximum results found throughout the entire model.

        With PowerGraphics active ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER), the averaging scheme for surface data with
        interior element data included ( :ref:`avres`,,FULL) and multiple facets per edge ( :ref:`efacet`,2
        or :ref:`efacet`,4) will yield differing minimum and maximum contour values depending on the
        Z-Buffering options ( :ref:`slashtype`,,6 or :ref:`slashtype`,,7). When the Section data is not
        included in the averaging schemes ( :ref:`slashtype`,,7), the resulting absolute value for the
        midside node is significantly smaller.

        The HIDC, HIDD, HIDP, ZBUF, ZQSL, and HQSL options produce displays with "hidden" lines removed.
        Hidden lines are lines obscured from view by another element, area, etc. The choice of non-Z-
        buffered hidden-line procedure types is available only for raster mode ( :ref:`device` ) displays.
        For vector mode displays, all non-Z-buffered "hidden-line" options use the same procedure (which is
        slightly different from the raster procedures). Both geometry and postprocessing displays may be of
        the hidden-line type. Interior stress contour lines within solid elements can also be removed as
        hidden lines, leaving only the stress contour lines and element outlines on the visible surfaces.
        Midside nodes of elements are ignored on postprocessing displays. Overlapping elements will not be
        displayed.

        The ZBUF, ZCAP, and ZQSL options use a specific hidden-line technique called software Z-buffering.
        This technique allows a more accurate display of overlapping surfaces (common when using Boolean
        operations or :ref:`eshape` on element displays), and allows smooth shaded displays on all
        interactive graphics displays. Z-buffered displays can be performed faster than HIDP and CAP type
        displays for large models. See also the :ref:`light`, :ref:`shade`, and :ref:`gfile` commands for
        additional options when Z-buffering is used.

        This command is valid in any processor.

            * ``CURVE`` - Filled areas under curves of line graphs. Use ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields for curve numbers.

            * ``ZCAP`` - If :ref:`slashtype`, ``WN``,ZCAP is the current display type, then :ref:`trlcy`,ZCAP, ``TLEVEL``
              will display the model in window ``WN`` with the portion of the model in front of the section plane
