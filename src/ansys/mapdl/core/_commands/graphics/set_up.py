        r"""Allows immediate display of a model as it is generated.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `IMMED <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_IMMED.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : int or str
            Immediate mode key:

            * ``0`` - Display only upon request, that is, no immediate display (default with the GUI off ).

            * ``1`` - Display immediately as model is generated (default with the GUI on ).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _IMMED_notes:

        The command enables you to control whether or not the model is displayed immediately as it is
        generated in an interactive session. Available only during an interactive session at a graphics
        display terminal. A valid graphics device name must first be specified ( :ref:`show` ).

        By default in the GUI, your model is immediately displayed in the Graphics window as you create new
        entities (such as areas, keypoints, nodes, elements, local coordinate systems, boundary conditions,
        etc.), referred to as immediate mode graphics.

        Symbols (such as boundary conditions, local coordinate system triads, etc.) appear immediately and
        are present on subsequent displays unless you disable the appropriate symbol (via the GUI plot
        controls function or the appropriate graphics-specification command).

        An immediate image is also scaled automatically to fit within the Graphics window. The new scaling
        is usually apparent on the automatic replot associated with immediate mode. To suppress automatic
        replot, issue :ref:`uis`,REPLOT,0. (With automatic replot suppressed, the immediate image may not
        always be scaled correctly.)

        An immediate display in progress should not be aborted with the usual system "break" feature (or
        else the Mechanical APDL session itself terminates). When you run Mechanical APDL interactively
        without using the
        GUI, immediate mode is off by default.

        This command is valid only in PREP7.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            Label specifying the operation to be performed:

            * ``CAPTURE`` - Capture the image from the graphics window to a new window.

            * ``DELETE`` - Delete the window that contains the file.

        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). If no extension is specified, :file:`bmp` will be
            used on Windows systems, and :file:`img` will be used on Linux systems.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `/DV3D <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_DV3D.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Mode label:

            * ``ACCU`` - Activating the accumulation buffer for OpenGL graphics, providing faster model rotation
              when shaded backgrounds are in use. This feature is off by default.

            * ``ACTR`` - Label term to designate the cursor position as the center for automatic dynamic
              rotational center capability. The subsequent ``Key`` value (see below) turns this capability on and
              off. This feature is on by default. (Available for OpenGL displays only.)

            * ``ANIM`` - Animation mode. The ANIM option allows you to create animation frames in pixmap mode
              instead of display list mode. This may improve large model performance, but it eliminates local
              manipulation while animation is in progress. This feature is on by default.

            * ``ANTI`` - Label term to control Anti-aliasing, a smoothing technique for your graph plots. (see
              below) The subsequent ``Key`` value turns this capability on and off. The default for this feature
              is off. (Available for OpenGL displays only).

            * ``CNTR`` - Switches banded contours on (1) or off (0) for your 3D contour display. The default is
              1 (ON). Other contour parameters such as number of contours or the increment and range are defined
              using the :ref:`contour` command. When either 9 or 128 contours are specified via :ref:`contour`,
              this command is ignored and a smooth contour is always displayed.

            * ``DGEN`` - Local manipulation degenerate mode. You access the DGEN option to set wire-frame local
              manipulation mode for 3D devices (device dependent). This feature is off by default.

            * ``DLIST`` - With DLIST, you can specify whether screen updates and redraws will be performed using
              the Mechanical APDL display list (off), or the 3D device's display list (on). DLIST is on by default for
              Windows systems, but off for Linux.

            * ``DELS`` - You use DELS to suppress contour display screen overwrites when :ref:`noerase` is
              active. This prevents the bleed-through that occurs when you overlay contour plots.

            * ``TRIS`` - Triangle strip mode. Tri-stripping provides faster 3D display capabilities and is on by
              default. Some display enhancements, such as texturing, are adversely affected by tri-stripping. You
              can turn off tri-stripping in order to improve these display functions. Be sure to turn tri-
              stripping on after the desired output is obtained.

        key : int or str
            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = ACCU:

            * ``0`` - (OFF) The accumulation buffer is not accessed. (default)

            * ``1`` - (ON) Access to the buffer is enabled.

            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = ACTR:

            * ``0`` - (OFF) The cursor position has no effect on the existing rotational center for dynamic
              operations.

            * ``1`` - (ON) The rotational center for dynamic rotations in OpenGL is determined by the position
              of the mouse cursor on (or within 15 pixels of) the model. Any rotations that are initiated with the
              cursor more than 15 pixels from the model will occur about the midpoint of the Z-axis at that point
              in space. If the Z-buffer has not been refreshed the Z-axis will have an infinite value, and
              rotations will appear to occur about an extremely long Z-axis. This behavior stops when the graphics
              window is refreshed or replotted. (default)

              Note that when using the GUI in 3D mode, when ACTR = 1, the ``Rotational Center`` option is grayed
              out under Utility Menu> PlotCtrls> View Setting because the rotational center is determined strictly
              by the position of the mouse cursor.

            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = ANIM:

            * ``0`` - Display list animation. The object can be dynamically manipulated while animating. No
              legend, countour or annotation items are displayed. (see Notes, below)

            * ``1`` - On Linux, device-dependent pixmap animation is used. On the PC, bitmap animation is
              provided (default). When you animate in this mode, you cannot dynamically manipulate your model (see
              Notes, below).

            * ``2`` - On the PC only, this option provides AVI animation which uses the AVI movie player.

              Although you can create animations of multiple Mechanical APDL window schemes, animations created with
              OpenGL display lists ( :ref:`dv3d`, ANIM, 0) do not retain the windowing scheme information. You CAN
              save multiple windows via the X11/WIN32 drivers, or via the OpenGL driver with :ref:`dv3d`, ANIM,
              KEY in effect (where KEY is not zero).

            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = ANTI

            * ``0`` - (OFF) Anti-aliasing is not active (default).

            * ``1`` - (ON) The anti-aliasing technique will be applied to smooth the lines in your displays
              (valid for OpenGL only).

            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = DGEN:

            * ``0`` - Normal manipulation.

            * ``1`` - Wireframe Manipulation.

            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = DLIST:

            * ``0`` - (OFF) The Mechanical APDL display list is used for plotting and dynamic graphics manipulation
              (Linux default).

            * ``1`` - (ON) The local (3D device) display list is used for plotting and dynamic rotation (Windows
              default).

            The following key options apply to ``Lab`` = TRIS:

            * ``0`` - (OFF) Tri-stripping is off.

            * ``1`` - (ON) Tri-stripping is on (default).

           for further explanations.

        Mechanical APDL uses display list animation for its 3D models. This memory resident array method
        interfaces
        with the OpenGL model information to allow the program to efficiently pan, zoom, rotate and
        dynamically manipulate your model during animation. The logo, legend, contour and other annotation
        items are produced in 2D and will not appear when :ref:`dv3d`, ANIM, 0 is in effect. To display
        these items, use :ref:`dv3d`, ANIM, 1. All screen data will be displayed, but manipulation of the
        model will not be possible.

        **Command default:**

        .. _s-DEVICE_default:

        Vector mode off (that is, raster mode); dithering on.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            Device function label:

            * ``BBOX`` - Bounding box mode. For PowerGraphics plots involving elements with :ref:`show`,x11 and
              :ref:`show`,win32, Mechanical APDL generally displays dynamic rotations faster. If KEY = 1 (ON), then a
              bounding box (not the elements) encompassing the model is displayed and rotated, rather than the
              element outlines (ON is default in preprocessing). When KEY = 0 (OFF), then dynamic rotations may be
              slower (Mechanical APDL redraws the element outlines) for plots involving elements with :ref:`show`,x11 and
              :ref:`show`,win32. OFF is default in postprocessing. This command is ignored if :ref:`edge`,WN,1 is
              set for any WN. This is ignored in POST1 and SOLUTION plots.

              For any PowerGraphics plots involving elements, regardless of :ref:`show` settings, plots will
              generally be displayed faster.

            * ``VECTOR`` - Vector mode. In vector mode, areas, volumes, elements, and postprocessing display
              geometries are shown as outlines (wireframes). When vector mode is off (default), these entities are
              shown filled with color.

            * ``DITHER`` - When dithering is turned on (default), color intensity transitions are smoothed. This
              selection a

              applies only to smooth-shaded images, that is, Z-buffered ( :ref:`slashtype` ), or raster plots with
              Gouraud or Phong shading ( :ref:`shade` ).

            * ``ANIM`` - Select the animation type used on 2D devices on the PC platform. A ``KEY`` value of BMP
              (or 0) sets animation mode to the Mechanical APDL animation controller (default). A ``KEY`` value of AVI
              (or 2) sets animation mode to AVI movie player file.

            * ``FONT`` - Font selection for the Mechanical APDL graphics window. When ``Label`` = FONT, the command format is:
              :ref:`device`,FONT, ``KEY``, ``Val1``, ``Val2``, ``Val3``, ``Val4``, ``Val5``, ``Val6`` where
              ``KEY`` determines the type of font being controlled, and values 1 through 6 control various font
              parameters. These values are device specific; using the same command input file ( :ref:`input` ) on
              different machines may yield different results.. The following ``KEY`` values determine the font
              information that will be supplied to the appropriate driver (for example, Postscript, X11, Win32,
              JPEG....):

              * ``KEY = 1`` - The command controls the LEGEND (documentation column) font.

              * ``KEY = 2`` - The command controls the ENTITY (node and keypoint number) font.

              * ``KEY = 3`` - The command controls the ANNOTATION/GRAPH font.

              Linux: Values 1 through 4 are used to find a match in the X11 database of font strings. Values 1, 2, and 3
              are character strings; value 4 is a nonzero integer:

              * ``Val1`` - Family name (for example, Courier). If ``Val1`` = MENU, all other values are ignored
                and a font selection menu appears (GUI must be active).

              * ``Val2`` - Weight (for example, medium)

              * ``Val3`` - Slant (for example, r)

              * ``Val4`` - Pixel size (for example, 14). Note that this value does no affect the annotation fonts
                ( ``KEY`` = 3). Use the :ref:`tspec` command for annotation font size.

              * ``Val5`` - unused

              * ``Val6`` - unused

              PC: The values are encoded in a PC logical font structure. Value 1 is a character string, and the
              remaining values are integers:

              * ``Val1`` - Family name (for example, Courier\2New) Substitute an asterisk (\2) for any blank
                character that appears in a family name. If ``Val1`` = MENU, all other values are ignored and a font
                selection menu appears (GUI must be active). When this value is blank, Mechanical APDL uses the first
                available resource it finds.

              * ``Val2`` - Weight (0 - 1000)

              * ``Val3`` - Orientation (in tenths of a degree)

              * ``Val4`` - Height (in logical units)

              * ``Val5`` - Width (in logical units)

              * ``Val6`` - Italics (0 = OFF, 1 = ON)

            * ``TEXT`` - Text size specification for the Mechanical APDL graphics window. Using this label with the
              :ref:`device` command requires the following form: :ref:`device`,TEXT, ``KEY``, ``PERCENT``. ``KEY``
              = 1 for LEGEND fonts; ``KEY`` = 2 for ENTITY fonts. ``PERCENT`` specifies the new text size as a
              percent of the default text size. If ``PERCENT`` = 100, the new text size is precisely the default
              size. If ``PERCENT`` = 200, the new text size is twice the default text size.

        key : int or str
            Control key:

            * ``OFF or 0`` - Turns specified function off.

            * ``ON or 1`` - Turns specified function on or designates the LEGEND font.

            * ``2`` - Designates the ENTITY font.

            * ``3`` - Designates the ANNOTATION/GRAPH font.

              values.

            * ``ORIENT`` - If ``Kywrd`` = ORIENT, then ``OPT`` will determine the orientation of the entire
              plot. ``OPT`` can be either Horizontal (default) or Vertical.

            * ``COLOR`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COLOR, then ``OPT`` will determine the color depth of the saved file.
              ``OPT`` can be 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to Black and White, Grayscale, and Color (default),
              respectively.

            * ``TMOD`` - If ``Kywrd`` = TMOD, then ``OPT`` will determine the text method. ``OPT`` can be either
              1 or 0, corresponding to bitmap text (default) or line stroke text, respectively.

            * ``DEFAULT`` - If ``Kywrd`` = DEFAULT, then all of the default values, for all of the Kywrd
              parameters listed above, are active.

            * ``STAT`` - Shows the current status of PNG file export.

        opt : str
            ``OPT`` can have the following names or values, depending on the value for ``Kywrd`` (see above).

            * ``ON, OFF`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COMP, the values On and Off control the use of compression. The
              degree of compression is determined by VAL

            * ``Horizontal, Vertical`` - If ``Kywrd`` = ORIENT, the terms Horizontal or Vertical determine the
              orientation of the plot.

            * ``0, 1, 2`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COLOR, the numbers 0, 1, and 2 correspond to Black and White,
              Grayscale and Color, respectively.

            * ``1, 0`` - If ``Kywrd`` = TMOD, the values 1 and 0 determine whether bitmap (1) or stroke text (0)
              fonts will be used

        val : int or str

            * ``ORIENT`` - If ``Kywrd`` = ORIENT, then ``OPT`` will determine the orientation of the entire
              plot. ``OPT`` can be either Horizontal (default) or Vertical.

            * ``COLOR`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COLOR, then ``OPT`` will determine the color attribute of the saved
              file. ``OPT`` can be 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to Black and White, Grayscale, and Color (default),
              respectively.

            * ``TMOD`` - If ``Kywrd`` = TMOD, then ``OPT`` will determine the text method. ``OPT`` can be either
              1 or 0, corresponding to bitmap text (default) or line stroke text, respectively.

            * ``DEFAULT`` - If ``Kywrd`` = DEFAULT, then all of the default values, for all of the Kywrd
              parameters listed above, are active.

        opt : str
            ``OPT`` can have the following names or values, depending on the value for ``Kywrd`` (see above).

            * ``1 or 0`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COMP, a value or 1 (on) or 0 (off) will control compression for the
              TIFF file.

            * ``Horizontal, Vertical`` - If ``Kywrd`` = ORIENT, the terms Horizontal or Vertical determine the
              orientation of the plot.

            * ``0, 1, 2`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COLOR, the numbers 0, 1, and 2 correspond to Black and White,
              Grayscale and Color, respectively.

            * ``1, 0`` - If ``Kywrd`` = TMOD, the values 1 and 0 determine whether bitmap (1) or stroke text (0)

        **Command default:**

        .. _s-COLOR_default:

        Use the default color mapping.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Apply color to the items specified by the following labels:

            * ``AXES`` - Determines the color (specified in next argument, ``Clab`` ) that the axes of a graph
              will be plotted in.

            * ``AXNUM`` - Determines the color (specified in next argument, ``Clab`` ) that the numbering on the
              axes of a graph will be plotted in.

            * ``NUM`` - Discretely numbered items (such as element types, element materials, etc., as shown on
              the :ref:`pnum` command). Also specify number (1 to 11) in the ``N1`` field. For example,
              :ref:`color`,NUM,RED,3 will assign the color red to all items having the discrete number 3 (material
              displays would show elements having material 3 as red).

            * ``OUTL`` - Outline of elements, areas, and volumes. Ex: :ref:`color`,OUTL,BLUE.

            * ``ELEM`` - Elements. Use ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields for element numbers.

            * ``LINE`` - Solid model lines. Use ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields for line numbers.

            * ``AREA`` - Solid model areas. Use ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields for area numbers.

            * ``VOLU`` - Solid model volumes. Use ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields for volume numbers.

            * ``ISURF`` - Isosurfaces (surfaces of constant stress, etc.). This option is particularly useful
              when capturing frames for animating a single isosurface value.

            * ``WBAK`` - Window background. Use ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields for window numbers. The options
              that you select using ``Lab`` = PBAK will supersede those applied using ``Lab`` = WBAK.

            * ``b.c.label`` - Boundary condition label. Enter U, ROT, TEMP, PRES, V, VOLT, MAG, A, EMF, CURR, F,
              M, HEAT, FLOW, VF, AMPS, FLUX, CSG, CURT, MAST, CP, CE, NFOR, NMOM, RFOR, RMOM, PATH. See the
              :ref:`pbc` command for boundary condition label definitions.

            * ``GRBAK`` - Graph background.

            * ``GRID`` - Graph grid lines.

            * ``AXLAB`` - Graph X and Y axis labels.

            * ``CURVE`` - Graph curves (identify curve numbers (1-10) in ``N1``, ``N2``, ``NINC`` fields).

            * ``CM`` - Component group. Use ``N1`` field for component name, ignore ``N2`` and ``NINC``.

            * ``CNTR`` - Mechanical APDL contour stress colors. The maximum number of contours available is 128. The
              number of colors that can be specified interactively (GUI) is 9. ( :ref:`contour`, 9). Any other
              setting will yield inconsistent results.

            * ``SMAX`` - Specifies that all stress values above the maximum value entered in :ref:`contour` will
              be displayed in the color designated in the ``Clab`` field. Defaults to dark grey.

            * ``SMIN`` - Specifies that all stress values below the minimum value entered in :ref:`contour` will
              be displayed in the color designated in the ``Clab`` field. Defaults to dark grey.

            * ``PBAK`` - Activates background shading options (see command syntax at end of argument
              descriptions below). The options that you select using ``Lab`` = PBAK will supersede those applied
              using ``Lab`` = WBAK.

        clab : str
            Valid color labels are:

            * ``BLAC (0)`` - Black

            * ``GCYA ((7)`` - Green-Cyan

            * ``GREE (8)`` - Green

            * ``YGRE (9)`` - Yellow-Green

            * ``YELL (10)`` - Yellow

            * ``ORAN (11)`` - Orange

            * ``RED (12)`` - Red

            * ``DGRA (13)`` - Dark Gray

            * ``LGRA (14)`` - Light Gray

            * ``WHIT (15)`` - White

        n1 : str
            Apply color to ``Lab`` items numbered ``N1`` to ``N2`` (defaults to ``N1`` ) in steps of
            ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``N1`` is blank, apply color to entire selected range. If ``Lab``

            picking of elements, lines, areas and volumes is enabled; your can assign colors to the entities
            via the picker. When picking is enabled, the ``Lab`` and ``Clab`` fields are ignored.

        n2 : str
            Apply color to ``Lab`` items numbered ``N1`` to ``N2`` (defaults to ``N1`` ) in steps of
            ``NINC`` (defaults to 1). If ``N1`` is blank, apply color to entire selected range. If ``Lab``

        ----------
        label : str
            Controls the type of replot.

            * ``RESIZE`` - Issued internally when a graphics window resize occurs (Default).

            * ``FAST`` - Only applicable for 3D devices that allow a fast redisplay for changes in the view
              characteristics only.

        Notes

        .. _s-REPLOT_notes:

        Reissues the last display command ( :ref:`nplot`, :ref:`eplot`, :ref:`kplot`, :ref:`plnsol`,
        :ref:`plvar`, etc.), along with its parameters, for convenience. The current display specifications
        are used.

        When the last display command is invalid in a given processor, :ref:`replot` is also invalid in that
        processor. However, if you attempt a :ref:`replot` and the last display command is invalid in the
        current processor, Mechanical APDL generates an element display ( :ref:`eplot` ) instead, as long as
        the
        last display command was  :ref:`plnsol`, :ref:`plesol`, or  :ref:`pldisp`.

          Example: :ref:`replot` Replaced by :ref:`eplot` Automatically

          :ref:`plnsol`, used to display solution results as continuous contours, is a valid command in the
          POST1 general postprocessor.

          If you issue :ref:`plnsol` followed by :ref:`replot` while in POST1, :ref:`replot` effectively
          reissues your earlier :ref:`plnsol` command, along with its parameters.

          If you then exit POST1, enter the PREP7 preprocessor, and again issue :ref:`replot`, the program
          uses :ref:`eplot` internally instead.

          The command substitution occurs because :ref:`plnsol` is not a valid command in PREP7.

        When you click one of the buttons on the `Pan, Zoom, Rotate
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_wid/Hlp_UI_PanZoom.html#wpanzoomk>`_
        dialog box to manipulate the view of a model, :ref:`replot` is issued internally. Thus, the
        substitution of :ref:`replot` with :ref:`eplot` as described above may also occur for operations
        that you perform via with the `Pan, Zoom, Rotate
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_wid/Hlp_UI_PanZoom.html#wpanzoomk>`_
         dialog box.

        :ref:`replot` does not show boundary conditions if they are applied only to a solid model and the
        last display command (such as :ref:`eplot` ) displays the finite element model. To show boundary
        conditions, the following options are available:

        * Issue :ref:`replot` after you issue :ref:`sbctran` to transfer solid model boundary conditions to
          the finite element model.

        * Issue :ref:`replot` after you issue a solid model display command (such as :ref:`vplot` ).

        This command is valid in any processor (except as noted above).

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            Device name, file name, or keyword, as listed below:

            * ``<, device name >`` - Any valid graphics display device name (for example, X11, 3D etc.).
              Defaults to X11 for most systems. See `Getting Started with Graphics
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS8_7.html>`_ in the `Basic Analysis Guide <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS19.html>`_
              for details. A device name must be defined before activating the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
              Once the GUI is activated, the device name cannot be changed for that session, except for switching
              between X11 and X11C.

            * ``TERM`` - Graphics displays are switched back to the last-specified device name.

            * ``CLOSE`` - This option purges the graphics file buffer. The CLOSE option should be issued any
              time you are changing graphics devices or file output types during a session. Graphics displays are
              switched back to the last-specified device name, and any open graphics files are closed. The CLOSE
              option is similar to the TERM option, however, with the CLOSE option, another process can access the
              data in the graphics file. The CLOSE option causes graphics file buffers to be flushed to the
              graphics file.

            * ``OFF`` - Graphics display requests are ignored.

            * ``(blank)`` - If blank in interactive mode, graphics will be displayed on screen as requested by
              display commands (no file written).

            * ``JPEG`` - Creates JPEG files that are named :file:`Jobname` nnn.jpg, where ``nnn`` is a numeric
              value that is incremented by one as each additional file is created; that is,
              :file:`Jobname000.jpg`, :file:`Jobname001.jpg`, :file:`Jobname002.jpg`, and so on. Ignores the
              ``Ext`` field.

            * ``TIFF`` - Creates tagged image format files that are named :file:`Jobname` nnn.tif, where ``nnn``
              is a numeric value that is incremented by one as each additional file is created; that is,
              :file:`Jobname000.tif`, :file:`Jobname001.tif`, :file:`Jobname002.tif`, and so on. This value for
              the ``Fname`` argument ignores the ``Ext`` field. (See the :ref:`tiff` command for options.)

            * ``PNG`` - Creates PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files that are named :file:`Jobname` nnn.png,
              where ``nnn`` is a numeric value that is incremented by one as each additional file is created; that
              is, :file:`Jobname000.png`, :file:`Jobname001.png`, :file:`Jobname002.png`, and so on. This value
              for the ``Fname`` argument ignores the ``Ext`` field. (See the :ref:`pngr` command for options.)

            * ``VRML`` - Creates Virtual Reality Meta Language files named :file:`Jobname000.wrl` that can be
              displayed on 3D Internet web browsers. Ignores the ``Ext`` and ``NCPL`` fields.

        option : str
            Assign a file name extension or specify reverse video output:

            * ``Ext`` - File name extension (eight-character maximum).

            * ``REV`` - Reverse background/image (black/white) colors. Valid with ``Fname`` = PNG (recommended),
              JPEG, and TIFF. This option is ignored if a previously specified color map table ( :ref:`cmap` or
              :ref:`rgb` ) is in effect.

        vect : int or str
            Specifies raster or vector display mode. This affects area, volume, and element displays, as well as
            geometric results displays such as contour plots. See the :ref:`device` command for an alternate way to toggle between raster and vector mode. Changing ``VECT`` also resets the :ref:`slashtype` command to its default.

            * ``0`` - Raster display (color filled entities; default)

            * ``1`` - Vector display (outlined entities; that is, "wireframe")

        ncpl : str
            Sets the number of color planes (4 to 8). Default is device-dependent. ``NCPL`` is not supported
            by all graphics devices.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `/GRAPHICS <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_GRAPHICS.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : str
            Graphics key:

            * ``FULL`` - Display all model geometry and results.

            * ``POWER`` - Activate PowerGraphics (default when GUI is on).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-GRAPHICS_notes:

        The :ref:`graphics` command specifies the type of graphics display. ``Key`` = POWER activates the
        PowerGraphics capability. PowerGraphics offers faster plotting than the _nolinebreak? ``Key`` = FULL
        option, /_nolinebreak? and speeds up element, results, area, line, and volume displays.

        The default PowerGraphics mode is enabled automatically when accessing the GUI. This action
        supersedes all prior macros or start-up routines ( :file:`start.ans`, :file:`config.ans`, etc.).
        Full graphics mode is accessed only by issuing :ref:`graphics`,FULL after the GUI is active.

        Results values (both printed and plotted) may differ between the _nolinebreak? ``Key`` = FULL
        /_nolinebreak? and ``Key`` = POWER options because each option specifies a different set of data for
        averaging and display. For _nolinebreak? ``Key`` = FULL /_nolinebreak?, all element and results
        values (interior and surface) are included. For _nolinebreak? ``Key`` = POWER /_nolinebreak?, only
        element and results values along the model exterior surface are processed.

        When ``Key`` = FULL, it is possible to deselect an individual node, select all elements (including
        the element that contains that node), and then perform postprocessing calculations on those elements
        and have that unselected node not be considered in those calculations. If PowerGraphics is active,
        however, postprocessing always displays based on selected elements.

        If you have specified one facet per element edge for PowerGraphics displays (via the :ref:`efacet`
        command or options from the General Postproc or Utility menu), PowerGraphics does not plot midside
        nodes. ( :ref:`efacet` applies to element type displays only.)

        Maximum values shown in plots can differ from printed maximum values. This is due to different
        averaging schemes used for plotted and printed maximum values.

        When using solution coordinate systems for results output ( :ref:`rsys`,SOLU) with PowerGraphics,
        the deformed or displaced shape in a POST1 contour display can be unexpected (although the contours
        are displayed in the expected colors). The program does not rotate displacement values (Ux,Uy,Uz) to
        global; instead, the displacements (stored locally) are added directly to the global coordinates
        (X,Y,Z). For example, if in PREP7 the nodes are rotated 90 degrees about the z axis and the global
        Uy displacements are relatively large, the Ux values will be large, causing the model to display a
        large deformation in the global X direction.

        PowerGraphics displays do not average at geometric discontinuities. The printouts in PowerGraphics
        will, however, provide averaging information at geometric discontinuities if the models do not
        contain shell elements. Carefully inspect the data you obtain at geometric discontinuities.

        PowerGraphics does not support the following diffusion analysis results: CONC, CG, DF, EPDI.

        ``Key`` = FULL is not available for `XFEM-based crack-growth analysis
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_frac/Hlp_G_FRACXFEM.html#fracxfemreferences>`_.

        Excepting a few options, PowerGraphics supports these commands:

        InformalTables need to be added.
        The following commands are executed via the _nolinebreak? ``Key`` = FULL /_nolinebreak? option,
        regardless of whether PowerGraphics is activated:

        Parameters
        ----------
        kywrd : str
            Specifies various JPEG file export options.

            * ``QUAL`` - If ``Kywrd`` = QUAL, then ``OPT`` is an integer value defining the JPEG quality index
              on an arbitrary scale ranging from 1 to 100. The default value is 75.

            * ``ORIENT`` - If ``Kywrd`` = ORIENT, then ``OPT`` will determine the orientation of the entire
              plot. ``OPT`` can be either Horizontal (default) or Vertical.

            * ``COLOR`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COLOR, then ``OPT`` will determine the color depth of the saved file.
              ``OPT`` can be 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to Black and White, Grayscale, and Color (default),
              respectively.

            * ``TMOD`` - If ``Kywrd`` = TMOD, then ``OPT`` will determine the text method. ``OPT`` can be either
              1 or 0, corresponding to bitmap text (default) or line stroke text, respectively.

            * ``DEFAULT`` - If ``Kywrd`` = DEFAULT, then all of the default values, for all of the Kywrd
              parameters listed above, are active.

        opt : str
            ``OPT`` can have the following names or values, depending on the value for ``Kywrd`` (see above).

            * ``1 to 100`` - If ``Kywrd`` = QUAL, a value between 1 and 100 will determine the quality index of
              the JPEG file.

            * ``Horizontal, Vertical`` - If ``Kywrd`` = ORIENT, the terms Horizontal or Vertical determine the
              orientation of the plot.

            * ``0,1,2`` - If ``Kywrd`` = COLOR, the numbers 0, 1, and 2 correspond to Black and White, Grayscale
              and Color, respectively.

            * ``1,0`` - If ``Kywrd`` = TMOD, the values 1 and 0 determine whether bitmap (1) or stroke text (0)
              fonts will be used
