        Mechanical APDL Command: `/VSCALE <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_VSCALE.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn : str
            Window number (or ALL) to which command applies (defaults to 1).

        vratio : str
            Ratio value applied to the automatically calculated scale factor (defaults to 1.0, that is, use
            scale factor as automatically calculated).

        key : int or str
            Relative scaling key:

            * ``0`` - Use relative length scaling among vectors based on magnitudes.

            * ``1`` - Use uniform length scaling for all vector lengths.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-VSCALE_notes:

        Allows scaling of the vector length displayed with the :ref:`plvect` command of POST1 and the
        :ref:`pbc` and :ref:`psf` commands. Also allows the scaling of the element (that is,
        :ref:`psymb`,ESYS) and the nodal (that is, :ref:`psymb`,NDIR) coordinate system symbols.

        The default value is AUTO or 0 except when:

        * Large deflection effects are included ( :ref:`nlgeom`,ON) and it is not a modal analysis; then the
          default is 1.
        * It is a spectrum analysis ( :ref:`antype`,SPECTR); then the default is OFF.
        * The amplitude of a time-harmonic solution is computed using the :ref:`hrcplx` command (OMEGAT
          _font FamName="Agency FB"? ≥ /_font? 360 _font FamName="Agency FB"? ° /_font? ); then the default
          is OFF.
        * The amplitude of a complex modal or harmonic solution is stored into the database using the
          :ref:`set` command ( ``KIMG`` = AMPL); then the default is OFF.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn : str
            Window number (or ALL) to which command applies (defaults to 1).

        dmult : int or str

            * ``AUTO or 0`` - Scale displacements automatically so that maximum displacement (vector amplitude)
              displays as 5 percent of the maximum model length, as measured in the global Cartesian X, Y, or Z
              directions.

            * ``1`` - Do not scale displacements (that is, scale displacements by 1.0, true to geometry). Often
              used with large deflection results.

            * ``FACTOR`` - Scale displacements by numerical value input for FACTOR.

            * ``OFF`` - Remove displacement scaling (that is, scale displacements by 0.0, no distortion).

            * ``USER`` - Set ``DMULT`` to that used for last display (useful when last ``DMULT`` value was
              automatically calculated).

        .. _s-DSCALE_notes:

        If Multi-Plots are not being displayed, and the current device is a 3D device ( :ref:`show`,3D),

        :ref:`slashdscale` commands are issued for each active window. For efficiency, the program maintains
        a single data structure (segment) containing only one displacement scale. The program displays the
        same segment (displacement scale) in all windows. Only the view settings will be different in each
        of the active windows.

        smult : str
            Contour multiplier that factors in results based on the product of the multiplier and the result
            being plotted. Defaults to 0.0 (no topographic effects).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-SSCALE_notes:

        Use this command to scale values to the geometry when the contours are shown elevated. For section
        displays ( :ref:`slashtype` ), the elevation is performed perpendicular to the section face.

        Nonzero contour multipliers factoring in large results (stresses or displacements) can produce very
        large distortion, causing images to disappear. To bring a distorted image back into view, reduce the
        contour multiplier value.
