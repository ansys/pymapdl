        .. _ANSTOAQWA_notes:

        This command creates the input file ``Fname``.aqwa for the Ansys Aqwa Multi-Body Hydrodynamics
        System
        for diffraction analysis in AQWA-LINE from the model currently in the database, based on the
        currently selected set of elements. The selected set must only include the hull envelope; no
        internal structure should be selected.

        There should be a line of nodes defined at the waterline. Only those elements that are entirely
        below the waterline will be specified as diffracting. If there are no waterline nodes, there will be
        no diffracting elements at the waterline, which will severely reduce the accuracy of the diffraction
        analysis.

        The translator maps PLANE42, SHELL63, and ``SHELL181`` elements to PANELs, and maps PIPE16 and
        PIPE59 elements to TUBEs. It does not recognize any other element types. Any material or geometric
        properties can be used for the shell elements, as AQWA does not need any properties at all and the
        command does not use them. All the shell elements below the water must have their normals pointing
        outward.

        TUBE elements in AQWA have material density, outside diameter, wall thickness, added mass, and drag
        coefficients, so appropriate properties should be used in the Mechanical APDL model. PIPE59 elements
        can
        have added mass and damping coefficients; these will be written to the file. The Mechanical APDL
        program
        uses the inertia coefficient C:sub:`M`, whereas AQWA uses the added mass coefficient C:sub:`A`,
        where C:sub:`M` = (1 + C:sub:`A` ). This correction is made automatically.

        This command contains some tables and extra information which can be inspected in the original
        documentation pointed above.

        In AQWA the vertical axis is always the Z-axis. The command can convert a model built with either
        the Y or Z-axis vertical, but the X-axis must be horizontal and should preferably be along the
        fore/aft axis of the vessel. If the structure is symmetric and you wish to use the symmetry options,
        you must only select one half or one quarter of the model, as appropriate. If you model a complete
        vessel and specify X symmetry, the AQWA model will contain two sets of coincident elements.

        If you are working from a model created for a structural analysis, it will probably be necessary to
        remesh the model as the structural mesh is most likely finer than needed for a diffraction analysis.

        If you enter this command interactively (with the GUI active) and no data is provided for the
        command options, the application prompts you for their values.

        You must verify the completeness and accuracy of the data written.

        **AQWA-LINE Notes**

        .. _ANSTOAQWA_aqwa:

        The file will specify restart stages 1-2 only. It has no options except REST, so AQWA may fail if
        any of the elements are badly shaped.

        The total mass is obtained by integrating over the wetted surface area and adding the TUBE masses,
        so it should be reasonably accurate. However, the integration used is not as accurate as that in
        AQWA, so there may be a small difference between the weight and buoyancy, particularly if tubes
        represent a large portion of the model.

        The position of the CG is unknown. A point mass is placed at the water-line above the CB, but you
        should change this to the correct position.

        The moments of inertia are estimated based on the overall dimensions of the model and using standard
        formulae for a ship. You should change these to the correct values.

        The maximum frequency is calculated from the maximum side length of the underwater elements. The
        range of frequencies runs from 0.1 rad/s to the calculated maximum, in steps of 0.1 rad/s.

        The directions are in steps of 15Â° over a range that is determined by the symmetry you have
        specified, in accordance with the requirements of AQWA.

        .. _ANSTOASAS_notes:

        This command creates an input file for the Ansys Asas Finite Element Analysis System from the model
        and loads currently in the database, based on the currently selected set of elements. Most common
        structural element types are written, as well as sections (or real constants), materials, boundary
        conditions and loads, and solution and load step options.

        **Data Written**

        The following data is written:

        * :ref:`Solution control options <solconop>`

        * Nodes

        * :ref:`Elements <elemdat>`

        * :ref:`Material data <matdat>`

        * :ref:`Section data <sectdat>`

        * Mechanical APDL element components (ASAS sets)

        * :ref:`Boundary conditions <boundcon>`

        * :ref:`Loads <loadsasas>`

        * Added mass (via ``MASS21`` element)

        Details are provided in the following sections.

        Not all data is written. You must verify the completeness and accuracy of the data. Only loading at
        the current step is transferred; hence, no load step history is captured.

        .. _solconop:

        .. rubric:: **Solution Control Options**

        The ASAS project name is defined as "Ansys".

        The solution control options are converted as follows:

        This command contains some tables and extra information which can be inspected in the original
        documentation pointed above.

        For conversion to ASAS(NL), the large displacement option is set based on :ref:`nlgeom`, final load
        solution time is set based on :ref:`time`, and sub-step times are set based on :ref:`deltim` or
        :ref:`nsubst` (assuming constant step size).

        .. _elemdat:

        .. rubric:: **Element Data**

        If you intend to use the data only with AQWA-WAVE, only the elements that form the wetted surface
        are required. Selecting these elements before invoking the :ref:`anstoasas` command will improve
        performance. In order for AQWA-WAVE to identify the direction of the wave loading, all elements must
        be defined by nodes in a clockwise direction. For further information, refer to the AQWA-WAVE
        manual.

        The element types are converted as follows:

        This command contains some tables and extra information which can be inspected in the original

        documentation pointed above.

        .. _loadsasas:

        .. rubric:: **Loads**

        No user loading is generated if AQWA-WAVE data is selected. However, a load case (number 1000) is
        automatically defined to identify the wetted surface of the elements for use by AQWA-WAVE based on
        the normal surface loads applied to the solid or shell elements.

        Pressure loads from ``SURF154`` elements are converted to equivalent nodal loads for ASAS. For AQWA-
        WAVE, the ``SURF154`` pressures are used to identify the wetted surface of the underlying elements.
        The following loads are converted for ASAS:

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. The file name defaults to :file:`Jobname`.

        ext : str
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum). The extension defaults to LGW if ``Fname`` and
            ``Ext`` are blank.

        kedit : str
            Flag to suppress nonessential commands:

            * ``NONE`` - Do not suppress any commands (default).

            * ``COMMENT`` - Write nonessential commands as comments (starting with !).

            * ``REMOVE`` - Do not write nonessential commands or comments.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _LGWRITE_notes:

        Writes the database command log to a named file. The database command log contains all commands that
        were used to create the current database. These commands are recorded in the database as they are
        issued, and saved in the database file ( :file:`File.DB` ) whenever the database is saved. The
        :ref:`lgwrite` command extracts these commands from the database and writes them to a file.
        Nonessential commands (for listing, graphics displays, help, etc.) can be excluded from the file by
        using the ``Kedit`` field. The file resulting from :ref:`lgwrite` can be used as command input to
        the program. This command is most useful if the session log file ( :file:`File.LOG` ), which is
        normally saved during an interactive session, has been lost or corrupted.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------

        distkey : str
            Key that specifies which file deletion action is performed on all processes in distributed-memory
            parallel mode:

            * ``0 (OFF or NO)`` - The program performs the file deletion only on the master process (default).

            * ``1 (ON or YES)`` - The program performs the file deletion locally on each process.

            * ``2 or BOTH`` - The program performs file deletion for ``Fname``. ``Ext`` on the master process
              and for ``FnameN``. ``Ext`` on all processes.

        Notes
        -----
        In distributed-memory parallel (DMP) mode, only the master process will delete ``Fname``. ``Ext``
        by default. However, when ``DistKey`` is set to 1 (or ON, or YES) or 2 (or BOTH), the command is
