        APDL Command: ANSTOASAS

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname
            ASAS file name. Defaults to Jobname.

        key
            Key indicating type of file to produce:

            0 - ASAS file for use by ANSYS Aqwa (no loads written). Creates the file
                Fname.asas.

            1 - ASAS file (all data written, including loads). Creates the file Fname.asas.

            2 - ASAS(NL) file. Creates the file Fname.asnl.

        Notes
        -----
        This command creates an input file for the ANSYS Asas Finite Element
        Analysis System from the model and loads currently in the database,
        based on the currently selected set of elements. Most common structural
        element types are written, as well as sections (or real constants),
        materials, boundary conditions and loads, and solution and load step
        options.

        Data Written

        The following data is written:

        Solution control options

        Nodes

        Elements

        Material data

        Geometry data

        Section data

        ANSYS element components (ASAS sets)

        Boundary conditions

        Loads

        Added mass (via MASS21 element)

        Details are provided in the following sections.

        Not all data is written. You must verify the completeness and accuracy
        of the data. Only loading at the current step is transferred; hence, no
        load step history is captured.

        Solution Control Options

        The ASAS project name is defined as "ANSYS".

        The solution control options are converted as follows:

        JOB: STAT SPIT: KGEOM

        JOB: STAT SPIT: KGEOM

        For conversion to ASAS(NL), the large displacement option is set based
        on NLGEOM, final load solution time is set based on TIME, and sub-step
        times are set based on DELTIM or NSUBST (assuming constant step size).

        Element Data

        If you intend to use the data only with AQWA-WAVE, only the elements
        that form the wetted surface are required.  Selecting these elements
        before invoking the ANSTOASAS command will improve performance.  In
        order for AQWA-WAVE to identify the direction of the wave loading, all
        elements must be defined by nodes in a clockwise direction. For further
        information, refer to the AQWA-WAVE manual.

        The element types are converted as follows:

        SPR1:  SPR2: if: rotational: spring:  FLA2: (ASAS(L): only):  if:
        nodes: are: not: coincident:  and: longitudinal: spring:

        QUM4:  TRM3: -: if: Triangular

        BRK8:  TET4: -: if: Tetrahedral:  BRK6: -: if: Prism

        QUS4:  TBC3: -: if: Triangular

        QUM8:  TRM6: -: if: Triangular

        BR20:  TE10: -: if: Tetrahedral: :  BR15: -: if: Prism

        QUS4:  TBC3: -: if: Triangular

        QUM4:  TRM3: -: if: Triangular

        QUM8:  TRM6: -: if: Triangular

        BRK8:  TET4: -: if: Tetrahedral:  BRK6: -: if: Prism

        TCBM: -: if: ASAS(L):  STF4: -: if: ASAS(NL)

        Documentation for this legacy element type appears in the Feature
        Archive.

        Material Data

        Linear isotropic material conversion is supported for ASAS and
        ASAS(NL).

            AQWA file name. Defaults to Jobname.

            Axis in the vertical direction:

            Y (or 2)  - Global Y axis.

            Z (or 3)  - Global Z axis (default).

        gc

            Density of water. Defaults to 1025.0.

            Waterline height in model coordinates. Defaults to 0.0.

        diffkey
            Diffracting model key:

            0 - Create a non-diffracting AQWA model.

            1 - Create a diffracting AQWA model (default).

        symxkey
            Key indicating if model is symmetric about the global XZ plane:

            0 - No symmetry about XZ plane (default).

            1 - Use symmetry about XZ plane. Only include (or select) half the model.

        symykey
            Key indicating if model is symmetric about the global YZ plane:

            0 - No symmetry about YZ plane (default).

            1 - Use symmetry about YZ plane. Only include (or select) half the model.

        Notes
        -----
        This command creates the input file Fname.aqwa for the ANSYS Aqwa
        Multi-Body Hydrodynamics System for diffraction analysis in AQWA-LINE
        from the model currently in the database, based on the currently
        selected set of elements. The selected set must only include the hull
        envelope; no internal structure should be selected.

        There should be a line of nodes defined at the waterline. Only those
        elements that are entirely below the waterline will be specified as
        diffracting. If there are no waterline nodes, there will be no
        diffracting elements at the waterline, which will severely reduce the
        accuracy of the diffraction analysis.

        The translator maps PLANE42, SHELL41, SHELL63, and SHELL181 elements to
        PANELs, and maps PIPE16 and PIPE59 elements to TUBEs. It does not
        recognize any other element types. Any material or geometric properties
        can be used for the shell elements, as AQWA does not need any
        properties at all and the command does not use them. All the shell
        elements below the water must have their normals pointing outward.

        TUBE elements in AQWA have material density, outside diameter, wall
        thickness, added mass, and drag coefficients, so appropriate properties
        should be used in the ANSYS model. PIPE59 elements can have added mass
        and damping coefficients; these will be written to the file. The ANSYS
        program uses the inertia coefficient CM, whereas AQWA uses the added
        mass coefficient CA, where CM = (1 + CA). This correction is made
        automatically.

        In AQWA the vertical axis is always the Z-axis. The command can convert
        a model built with either the Y or Z-axis vertical, but the X-axis must
        be horizontal and should preferably be along the fore/aft axis of the
        vessel.  If the structure is symmetric and you wish to use the symmetry
        options, you must only select one half or one quarter of the model, as
        appropriate. If you model a complete vessel and specify X symmetry, the
        AQWA model will contain two sets of coincident elements.

        If you are working from a model created for a structural analysis, it
        will probably be necessary to remesh the model as the structural mesh
        is most likely finer than needed for a diffraction analysis.

        If you enter this command interactively (with the GUI active) and no
        data is provided for the command options, you will be prompted for
        their values.

        You must verify the completeness and accuracy of the data written.

        -----
        Writes the database command log to a named file.  The database
        command log contains all commands that were used to create the
        current database.  These commands are recorded in the database
        as they are issued, and saved in the database file (File.DB)
        whenever the database is saved.  The LGWRITE command extracts
        these commands from the database and writes them to a file.
        Nonessential commands (for listing, graphics displays, help,
        etc.) can be excluded from the file by using the Kedit field.
        The file resulting from LGWRITE can be used as command input
        to the program.  This command is most useful if the session
        log file (File.LOG), which is normally saved during an
        interactive session, has been lost or corrupted.

            248 characters is allowed for the file name (or combined
            file name and directory path, if both are specified).

        ext2
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        distkey
            Key that specifies whether the rename operation is
            performed on all processes in distributed parallel mode
            (Distributed ANSYS):

            1 (ON or YES) - The program performs the rename operation
            locally on each process.

            0 (OFF or NO) - The program performs the rename operation
            only on the master process (default).

        Notes
        -----
        Renames a file.  Ex: /RENAME,A,,,B renames file A to B in the
        same directory.  /RENAME,A,DAT,,,INP renames file A.DAT to
        A.INP. On all systems, this command will overwrite any
        existing file named B. See the Operations Guide for
        details. Only ANSYS binary files should be renamed. Use /SYS
        and system renaming commands for other files.

        In distributed parallel mode (Distributed ANSYS), only the
        master process will rename Fname1.Ext1 to Fname2.Ext2 by
        default. However, when DistKey is set to 1 (or ON or YES), the
        command is executed by all processes. In this case, Fname1 and
        Fname2 will automatically have the process rank appended to
        them. This means Fname1N.Ext1 will be renamed to Fname2N.Ext2
        by all processes, where N is the Distributed ANSYS process
        rank. For more information see Differences in General Behavior
        in the Parallel Processing Guide.

        Renaming across system partitions may be internally done by a
        copy and delete operation on some systems.

        This command is valid only at the Begin Level.
