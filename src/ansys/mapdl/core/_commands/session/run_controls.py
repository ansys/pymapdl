        Mechanical APDL Command: `/CONFIG <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_CONFIG.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Configuration parameter to be changed:

            * ``NORSTGM`` - Option to write or not write geometry data to the results file:

              * When ``VAL`` = 0, write geometry data (default).
              * When ``VAL`` = 1, does not write geometry data.

              Useful when complex analyses are likely to create abnormally large files.

            * ``NBUF`` - The number of buffers ( ``VAL`` = 1 to 32) per file in the solver. Default: ``VAL`` =
              4.

            * ``LOCFL`` - File open and close actions:

              * When ``VAL`` = 0, global (default).
              * When ``VAL`` = 1, local.

              Applies to :file:`File.EROT`, :file:`File.ESAV`, and :file:`FileEMAT`.

              Typically used for large problems where locally closed files may be deleted earlier in the run via
              :ref:`slashfdele`.

            * ``SZBIO`` - Record size ( ``VAL`` = 1024 to 4194304) of binary files (in integer words).

              Default: ``VAL`` = 16384 (system-dependent).

            * ``FSPLIT`` - Defines split points for binary files. ``VAL`` is the file split point in megawords.

              Default: ``VAL`` = Maximum file size for the system.

            * ``MXND`` - Maximum number of nodes.

              Default: ``VAL`` = 100 at first encounter.

              Dynamically expanded by doubling, even at first encounter, when the maximum is exceeded.

            * ``MXEL`` - Maximum number of elements. Default and expansion as for MXND.

            * ``MXKP`` - Maximum number of keypoints. Default and expansion as for MXND.

            * ``MXLS`` - Maximum number of lines. Default and expansion as for MXND.

            * ``MXAR`` - Maximum number of areas. Default and expansion as for MXND.

            * ``MXVL`` - Maximum number of volumes. Default and expansion as for MXND.

            * ``MXRL`` - Maximum number of sets of real constants (element attributes). Default and expansion as
              for MXND.

            * ``MXCP`` - Maximum number of sets of coupled degrees of freedom. Default and expansion as for
              MXND.

            * ``MXCE`` - Maximum number of constraint equations. Default and expansion as for MXND.

            * ``NOELDB`` - Option to write or not write results into the database after a solution.

              * When ``VAL`` = 0 (default), writes results into the database.
              * When ``VAL`` = 1, does not write results into the database.
            * ``NUMLV`` - Maximum number of load vectors written on :file:`Jobname.MODE` file when ``MSUPkey`` =
              YES on the :ref:`mxpand` command.

              Default: ``VAL`` = 1000 at first encounter.

              When the maximum is exceeded, the value is not expanded.

              The NUMLV option is not supported for fast load vector generation ( ``FastLV`` = ON on the
              :ref:`modcont` command).

            * ``NUMSUBLV`` - Maximum number of load vectors written on :file:`Jobname.SUB` file in
              substructure/CMS generation pass.

              Default: ``VAL`` = 31 at first encounter.

              When the maximum is exceeded, the value is not expanded.

            * ``GRW_NBUF`` - Option to automatically grow the number of file buffers for most binary files ( :file:`.ESAV`,
              :file:`.EMAT`, :file:`.FULL`, and so on), with the exception of the results file and files written
              by the sparse and PCG equation solvers (for example, :file:`.DSPxxxx` and :file:`.PCn` ).

              * When ``VAL`` = -1, the number of file buffers does not grow automatically for any file.
              * When ``VAL`` = 0 (default), the number of file buffers may or may not grow automatically. The
                logic is program-controlled.
              * When ``VAL`` = 1, the number of file buffers automatically grows for most binary files to reduce
                the amount of I/O. This option may require a significantly greater amount of memory than the
                default behavior ( ``VAL`` = 0).
            * ``MEBA_LIC`` - Option to control automatic checkout of a Mechanical batch license during solution when the
              capability is not enabled, useful for PrepPost sessions:

              * When ``VAL`` = 0 (default), check out a license automatically when needed.
              * When ``VAL`` = 1, bypass automatic license checkout.
            * ``STAT`` - Displays current values set by the :ref:`config` command.

        val : str
            Value (an integer number) assigned to the specified configuration parameter.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-CONFIG_notes:

        All configuration parameters have initial defaults, which in most cases do not need to be changed.
        Where a specially configured version of the Mechanical APDL program is desired, the parameters can
        be
        changed with this command.

        Issue :ref:`config`,STAT to display current values.

        Define changes before the parameter is required.

        These changes (and others) may also be incorporated into the :file:`config.ans` file, read in upon
        execution of the program. (See `The Configuration File
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS19_4.html#a6c2Kn1b3ctg>`_
        in the `Basic Analysis Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS19.html>`_.) If the same
        configuration parameter appears in both the configuration file and
        this command, this command overrides.

        Distributed-memory parallel DMP solutions use the default FSPLIT value and force NOELDB = 1 for all
        results files. You cannot change the FSPLIT and NOELDB options for a DMP solution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            Name (32 characters maximum) to be used as the :file:`Jobname`. Defaults to the initial
            :file:`Jobname` as specified on the Mechanical APDL execution command, or to :file:`file` if
            none specified.

        key : str
            Specify whether to use the existing log, error, lock, page, and output files ( :file:`.LOG`, :file:`.ERR`, :file:`.LOCK`, :file:`.PAGE` and :file:`.OUT` ) or
            start new files.

            * ``0, OFF`` - Continue using current log, error, lock, page, and output files.

            * ``1, ON`` - Start new log, error, lock, page, and output files (old log and error files are closed
              and saved, but old lock, page, and output files are deleted). Existing log and error files are
              appended.

        All subsequently created files will be named with this :file:`Jobname` if ``Key`` = 0. Use ``Key`` =
        1 to start new log, error, lock, page, and output files. The previous :file:`Jobname` is typically

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname : str
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters needed for the
            directory path). An unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case,
            you can use all 248 characters for the file name. The file name defaults to the current

            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        dir_ : str
            Directory path (64 characters maximum). Defaults to current directory.

        line : str
            A value indicating either a line number in the file or a user-defined label in the file from which
            to begin reading the input file.

            * ``(blank), 0, or 1`` - Begins reading from the top of the file (default).

            * ``LINE_NUMBER`` - Begins reading from the specified line number in the file.

            * ``label`` - Begins reading from the first line beginning with the matching user-defined label :
              ``label`` (beginning with a colon (:), 8 characters maximum).

        log : int or str
            Indicates whether secondary input from this command should be recorded in the command log ( :file:`File.LOG` ) and the database log:

            * ``0`` - Record only the :ref:`input` command on the log (default).

            * ``1`` - Record commands in the specified secondary file as they are executed.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-INPUT_notes:

        Switches the input file for the next commands. Commands are read from this file until an end-of-file
        or another file switching directive is read. An end-of-file occurs after the last record of the file
        or when a ``/EOF`` command is read. An automatic switch back one level (to the previous file) occurs
        when an end-of-file is encountered. Twenty levels of nested file switching are allowed. Note that
        files including ``*DO``, :ref:`use`, :ref:`ulib`, and the "Unknown Command" Macro have less nesting
        available because each of these operations also uses a level of file switching. For an interactive
        run, a :ref:`input`,TERM switches to the terminal for the next input. A ``/EOF`` read from the
        terminal then switches back to the previous file. A :ref:`input` (with a blank second field)
        switches back to the primary input file.

        Setting ``LOG`` = 1 on :ref:`input` causes all commands read from the specified file to be recorded
        in the command log ( :file:`File.LOG` ) and the internal database command log ( :ref:`lgwrite` ).
        This option is recommended if the log file will be used later. The ``LOG`` = 1 option is only valid
        when the :ref:`input` occurs in the primary input file. Using ``LOG`` = 1 on a nested :ref:`input`
        or on a :ref:`input` within a do-loop will have no effect (that is, commands in the secondary input
        file are not written to the command log).

        The ``Dir`` option is optional as the directory path can be included directly in ``Fname``.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        The :ref:`memm` command does not affect the value you specify with the -m switch. When you allocate
        memory with the -m switch, that amount will always be available. However, if dynamic memory
        allocation in excess of the -m value occurs, you can use the :ref:`memm` command to ensure that

            Maximum number of warning and error messages allowed per command before run aborts (must be
            greater than zero). Maximum value is 99,999,999. Defaults to 10,000.

        ifkey : str
            Specifies whether or not to abort if an error occurs during a :ref:`input` operation:

            * ``0, or OFF`` - Do not abort. This option is the default.

            * ``1, or ON`` - Abort.

        num : int or str
            The number of invalid command warnings before a stop warning will be issued:

            * ``0`` - Disables the stop warning/error function.

            * ``n`` - An integer value representing the number of warnings that will be encountered before
              prompting the user to stop (default = 5). The first error encountered will ALWAYS result in a
              prompt.

              Invalid command warnings and error tracking are mutually exclusive.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-NERR_notes:

        Limits the number of warning and error messages displayed for any one command in an interactive run.

        Warning and error messages continue to be written to :file:`Jobname.ERR` regardless of these limits,
        unless ``NMERR`` is negative. There is no way to totally suppress writing of warning and error
        messages to the error file.

        Issue this command with ``NUM`` = ``n`` to specify the number of invalid command warnings to be
        encountered before the user is prompted to stop. You can then continue or abort the run. If you
        choose to abort the run, the log file can be saved so that any of the processing up to that point
        can be appended to an input that rectifies the condition. A batch run always aborts on the first
        error. Issue :ref:`nerr`,STAT to list current settings.

        Issue :ref:`nerr`,DEFA to reset values to initial defaults.

        An ``IFKEY`` value of 1 or ON causes Mechanical APDL to terminate immediately upon encountering an
        error during a file :ref:`input` operation. However, use of this option may cause the following
        conditions to occur:

        * The :ref:`input` command may abort if issued for a log file ( :file:`jobname.log` ).

        * Some macros may terminate.

        * A CAD connection may fail after reading only a small portion of a CAD model.

        The command is valid in any processor.

        The :ref:`pause` command temporarily releases (or pauses) the current product license so that

        This application consumes a license as soon as you launch it, and retains that license until it is
        finished. If you launch the product interactively, the license is retained until you either close
        the application or issue a :ref:`pause` command via the command line.

        No other operation (other than :ref:`save` or ``/EXIT`` ) is possible in the current application
         while use of the product license is paused.

        When the second application has finished and releases the license, issue an :ref:`unpause` command

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            Behavior control key:

            * ``BORD`` - Controls the functionality of the mouse buttons for dynamic viewing mode only. When
              ``Label`` = BORD, the three values that follow control the functionality of the LEFT, MIDDLE and
              RIGHT buttons, respectively (see below).

            * ``MSGPOP`` - Controls which messages from the Mechanical APDL error-message subroutine are displayed in a
              message dialog box.

            * ``REPLOT`` - Controls whether or not an automatic replot occurs after functions affecting the
              model are executed.

            * ``ABORT`` - Controls whether or not the program displays dialog boxes to show the status of an
              operation in progress and to cancel that operation.

            * ``DYNA`` - Controls whether the dynamic mode preview is a bounding box or the edge outline of the
              model. This label only applies to 2D display devices (that is, :ref:`show`,XII or
              :ref:`show`,WIN32). This "model edge outline" mode is only supported in PowerGraphics (
              :ref:`graphics`,POWER) and is intended for element, line, results, area, or volume displays.

            * ``PICK`` - Controls how graphical entities are highlighted from within the the Select menu.

            * ``POWER`` - Controls whether or not PowerGraphics is active when the GUI is initiated. Mechanical APDL
              default status is PowerGraphics "ON"; this command is used (placed in the :file:`start.ans` file)
              when full graphics is desired on start up.

            * ``DPRO`` - Controls whether or not the input window displays a dynamic prompt. The dynamic prompt
              shows the correct command syntax for the command, as you are entering it.

            * ``UNDO`` - Controls whether or not the session editor includes nonessential commands or comments
              in the file it creates. You can use this option to include comments and other materials in the
              session editor file.

            * ``LEGE`` - Controls whether or not the multi-legend is activated when you start the GUI. The
              multi-legend enables you to specify the location of your legend items in each of the five graphics
              windows. You can place this option in your :file:`start.ans` file and have the GUI start with the
              legend items in a pre-specified location.

            * ``PBAK`` - Controls whether or not the background shading is activated when you start the GUI. You
              can place this option in your :file:`start.ans` file.

            * ``ZPIC`` - Controls the sorting order for entities that are coincident (directly in front of or
              behind each other) to a picked spot on your model. When you pick a spot on your model that could
              indicate two or more entities, a message warns you of this condition, and a list of the coincident
              entities can be generated. The ``VALUE`` term (below) will determine the sort order.

            * ``HPOP`` - Controls the prioritization of your GUI windows when the contents are ported to a plot
              or print file ( :ref:`ui`,COPY,SAVE). OpenGL (3D) graphics devices require that the Mechanical APDL
              graphics window contents be set in front of all overlying windows in order to port them to a printer
              or a file. This operation can sometimes conflict with :ref:`noerase` settings. See the ``VALUE``
              term (below) to determine the available control options.

        value : int or str
            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = BORD:

            (These values control the operation according to syntax : :ref:`uis`,BORD, LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT )

            * ``1`` - PAN, controls dynamic translations.

            * ``2`` - ZOOM, controls zoom, and dynamic rotation about the view vector.

            * ``3`` - ROTATE, controls dynamic rotation about the screen X and Y axes.

              You can designate any value for any button, or designate the same value for all three buttons. If no
              value is specified, default is LEFT = PAN, MIDDLE = ZOOM and RIGHT = ROTATE.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = MSGPOP:

            * ``0`` - All messages displayed.

            * ``1`` - Only notes, warnings, and errors displayed.

            * ``2`` - Only warnings and errors displayed (default).

            * ``3`` - Only errors displayed.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = REPLOT:

            * ``0`` - No automatic replot.

            * ``1`` - Automatic replot (default).

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = ABORT:

            * ``ON`` - Display status and cancellation dialog boxes (default).

            * ``OFF`` - Do not display status and cancellation dialog boxes.

            * ``1`` - Same as ON.

            * ``0`` - Same as OFF.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = DYNA:

            * ``0`` - Use model edge outline when possible (default).

            * ``1`` - Use bounding box preview.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = PICK:

            * ``0`` - Picked keypoints and nodes are enclosed by a square. Picked lines are overlaid by a
              thicker line. Picked areas, volumes, and elements (non-point/non-line) are redrawn with highlighting
              colors. However, if the pick is a box, circle, or polygon pick, the highlighting for all entitles
              consists only of a square placed around the entity's centroid.

            * ``1`` - Picked entities are not highlighted.

            * ``2`` - 5.1 highlighting (that is, no XOR).

            * ``3`` - Picked entities are highlighted as in ``VALUE`` = 0, except that, for a box, circle, or
              polygon pick, the picked areas, volumes, and elements (non-point/non-line) are redrawn with
              highlighting colors. This technique is slower than the ``VALUE`` = 0 technique.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = POWER:

            * ``0`` - Start GUI in Full Graphics mode.

            * ``1`` - Start GUI in PowerGraphics mode (default).

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = DPRO:

            * ``0 or OFF`` - Do not display the dynamic prompt.

            * ``1 or ON`` - Display the dynamic prompt (default).

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = UNDO:

            * ``0 or None`` - Do not suppress any commands (default).

            * ``1 or Comment`` - Write the nonessential commands to the session editor file as comments (with a
              ! at the beginning).

            * ``2 or Remove`` - Do not write nonessential commands or comments.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = LEGE:

            * ``0 or OFF`` - Start GUI with the enhanced legend off (default).

            * ``1 or ON`` - Start GUI with the enhanced legend capability activated.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = PBAK:

            * ``0 or OFF`` - Start the GUI with the no background shading (default).

            * ``1 or ON`` - Start the GUI with background shading activated.

            Values controlling behavior if ``Label`` = HPOP:

            * ``0 or OFF`` - No rewrite operations are performed to compensate for items that obscure or overlay
              the graphics window (default).

            * ``1 or ON`` - The Graphics screen contents are replotted to ensure that they are situated in front
              of all other windows. If :ref:`noerase` is detected, this operation is suppressed.

        ``Label``,DEFA for status and to reset a specific ``Label`` item.

        A :ref:`uis`,HPOP,1 command employs a fast redraw method which does not allow entering the legend
        logic for a :ref:`plopts`,INFO,1 or :ref:`plopts`,INFO,2 command. However, the legend is redrawn
        for :ref:`plopts`,INFO,3 because that command also allows a fast redraw.
