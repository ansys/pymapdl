        APDL Command: /CONFIG

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Configuration parameter to be changed:

            NORSTGM - Option to write or not write geometry data to
                      the results file. VALUE is either 0 (write
                      geometry data) or 1 (do not write geometry
                      data). Useful when complex analyses will create
                      abnormally large files. Default is 0.

            NBUF - VALUE is the number of buffers (1 to 32) per file
                   in the solver.  Defaults to 4.

            LOCFL - File open and close actions.  For VALUE use: 0 for
                    global (default); 1 for local.  Applicable to
                    File.EROT, File.ESAV, and File.EMAT.  Typically
                    used for large problems where locally closed files
                    may be deleted earlier in the run with the /FDELE
                    command.

            SZBIO - VALUE is the record size (1024 to 4194304) of
                    binary files (in integer words).  Defaults to
                    16384 (system dependent).

            ORDER - Automatic reordering scheme.  For VALUE use: 0 for
                    WSORT,ALL; 1 for WAVES; 2 for both WSORT,ALL and
                    WAVES (default).

            FSPLIT - Defines split points for binary files.  VALUE is
                     the file split point in megawords and defaults to
                     the maximum file size for the system.

            MXND - Maximum number of nodes. If not specified, defaults
                   to 100 at first encounter.  Dynamically expanded by
                   doubling, even at first encounter, when maximum is
                   exceeded.

            MXEL - Maximum number of elements.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXKP - Maximum number of keypoints.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXLS - Maximum number of lines.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXAR - Maximum number of areas.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXVL - Maximum number of volumes.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXRL - Maximum number of sets of real constants (element
                   attributes).  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXCP - Maximum number of sets of coupled degrees of
                   freedom.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            MXCE - Maximum number of constraint equations.  Default
            and expansion as for MXND.

            NOELDB - Option to write or not write results into the
                     database after a solution.  When VALUE = 0
                     (default), write results into the database.  When
                     VALUE = 1, do not write results into the
                     database.

            DYNA_DBL - Option to invoke the double precision version
                       of the explicit dynamics solver LS-DYNA. When
                       VALUE = 0 (default), the single precision
                       version is used. When VALUE = 1, the double
                       precision version is used.

            STAT - Displays current values set by the /CONFIG command.

        value
            Value (an integer number) assigned to the configuration parameter.

        Notes
        -----
        All configuration parameters have initial defaults, which in most cases
        do not need to be changed.  Where a specially configured version of the
        ANSYS program is desired, the parameters may be changed with this
        command.  Issue /CONFIG,STAT to display current values.  Changes must
        be defined before the parameter is required.  These changes (and
        others) may also be incorporated into the config162.ans file which is
        read upon execution of the program (see The Configuration File in the
        Basic Analysis Guide).  If the same configuration parameter appears in
        both the  configuration file and this command, this command overrides.

        Distributed ANSYS uses the default FSPLIT value, and forces NOELDB = 1
        and NORSTGM = 0 for all results files. The FSPLIT, NOELDB, and NORSTGM
        options cannot be changed when using Distributed ANSYS.

        The /CONFIG command is not valid for the ANSYS Multiphysics 1, 2, or 3
        products.

        The ANSYS Multi-field solver (MFS and MFX) does not support
        /CONFIG,NOELDB,1. The ANSYS Multi-field solver needs the updated ANSYS
        database.

        Parameters

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum,
            including the characters needed for the directory path).  An
            unspecified directory path defaults to the working directory;

            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

            Directory path (64 characters maximum). Defaults to current
            directory.

        line
            A value indicating either a line number in the file or a user-
            defined label in the file from which to begin reading the

            (blank), 0, or 1 - Begins reading from the top of the file (default).

            LINE_NUMBER - Begins reading from the specified line number in the file.

            :label - Begins reading from the first line beginning with the
                     matching user-defined label :label (beginning with a
                     colon (:), 8 characters maximum).

        log
            Indicates whether secondary input from this command should be
            recorded in the command log (File.LOG) and the database log:

            0 - Record only the /INPUT command on the log (default).

            1 - Record commands in the specified secondary file as they are executed.

        Notes
        -----
        Switches the input file for the next commands.  Commands are read
        from this file until an end-of-file or another file switching
        directive is read.  An end-of-file occurs after the last record of
        the file or when a /EOF command is read.  An automatic switch back
        one level (to the previous file) occurs when an end-of-file is
        encountered.  Twenty levels of nested file switching are allowed.
        Note that files including ``*DO``, ``*USE``, ``*ULIB``, and the "Unknown
        Command" Macro have less nesting available because each of these
        operations also uses a level of file switching.  For an
        interactive run, a /INPUT,TERM switches to the terminal for the
        next input.  A /EOF read from the terminal then switches back to
        the previous file.  A /INPUT (with a blank second field) switches
        back to the primary input file.

        Setting LOG = 1 on /INPUT causes all commands read from the
        specified file to be recorded in the command log (File.LOG) and
        the internal database command log [LGWRITE].  This option is
        recommended if the log file will be used later .  The LOG = 1
        option is only valid when the /INPUT occurs in the primary input
        file.  Using LOG = 1 on a nested /INPUT or on a /INPUT within a
        do-loop will have no effect (i.e., commands in the secondary input
        file are not written to the command log).

        The Dir option is optional as the directory path can be included
        directly in Fname.

        operation is finished. This option always maintains the highest level
        used during the analysis until the analysis is finished.

        The MEMM command does not affect the value you specify with the -m
        switch. When you allocate memory with the -m switch, that amount will
        always be available. However, if dynamic memory allocation in excess of
        the-m value occurs, you can use the MEMM command to ensure that amount
        is retained until the end of your analysis.

            turned on, 20 for interactive runs with the GUI turned

            Abort level key.  Set to 0 for default abort behavior, -1
            to never abort, and -2 to abort after ``nmabt`` errors.

            0 or OFF - Do not abort. This option is the default.

            1 or ON - Abort.

        num
            The number of invalid command warnings before a stop warning will
            be issued:

            0 - Disables the stop warning/error function.

            n - An integer value representing the number of warnings that will be encountered
                before prompting the user to stop (default = 5). The first
                error encountered will ALWAYS result in a prompt.

        Notes
        -----
        Limits the number of warning and error messages displayed for any one
        command in an interactive run.

        Warning and error messages continue to be written to Jobname.ERR
        regardless of these limits (unless NMERR is negative).

        Issue this command with NUM = n to specify the number of "invalid
        command" warnings to be encountered before the user is prompted to
        stop. You can then continue or abort the run. If you choose to abort
        the run, the log file can be saved so that any of the processing up to
        that point can be appended to an input that rectifies the condition. A
        batch run always aborts on the first error.  Issue /NERR,STAT to list
        current settings.

        Issue /NERR,DEFA to reset values to initial defaults.

        An IFKEY value of 1 or ON causes the ANSYS program to abort immediately
        upon encountering an error during a file /INPUT operation. However, use
        of this option may cause the following conditions to occur:

        The /INPUT command may abort if issued for a log file (jobname.log).

        Some macros may abort.

                              ANSYS internal parameters.

            Lists only parameters with names ending with an underbar (_). A good APDL programming convention is to ensure that all parameters created by your system programmer are named with a trailing underbar. - Lists all toolbar abbreviations.

            Lists all parameters (except local macro parameters and those with names beginning or ending with an underbar). - Lists all APDL Math parameters, including vectors, matrices, and linear
                              solvers.

            Lists only the parameter specified. PARNAME cannot be a local macro parameter name. - Lists all local macro parameter values (ARG1- AR99) that are non-zero or non-
                              blank.

        imin, imax, jmin, jmax, kmin, kmax, lmin, lmax, mmin, mmax
            Range of array elements to display (in terms of the dimensions
            (row, column, plane, book, and shelf).   Minimum values default to
            1.  Maximum values default to the maximum dimension values.  Zero
            may be input for IMIN, JMIN, and KMIN to display the index numbers.
            See ``*TAXIS``  command to list index numbers of 4- and 5-D tables.

        kpri
            Use this field to list your primary variable labels (X, Y, Z, TIME,
            etc.).

            List the labels (default). YES, Y, or ON are also valid entries.  - Do not list the labels. NO, N, or OFF are also valid entries.

        Notes
        -----
        You cannot obtain the value for a single local parameter (e.g.,
        ``*STATUS,ARG2``). You can only request all local parameters simultaneously
        using ``*STATUS,ARGX``.

        This command is valid in any processor.
