        Mechanical APDL Command: `/COM <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_COM.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        comment : str
            Comment string, up to 75 characters.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-COM_notes:

        The output from this command consists of the comment string. This command is similar to ``C***``
        except that the comment produced by ``C***`` is more easily identified in the output. Parameter
        substitution within the comment occurs for every valid expression delimited by percent (%) signs.
        Enclosing such an expression in single quotes prevents parameter substitution.

        Another way to include a comment is to precede it with a ! character (on the same line). The ! may
        be placed anywhere on the line, and any input following it is ignored as a comment. No output is
        produced by such a comment, but the comment line is included on the log file. This is a convenient
        way to annotate the log file.

        This command is valid anywhere.

        .. warning::

            PyMAPDL uses the console output to parse and retrieve information from the MAPDL
            instance. Hence, it is strongly advised to **NOT** use this command unless you really
            know what you are doing. In case of an accidental ``NOPR`` activation, you can run
            `mapdl.gopr()` to reactivate console output.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _s-NOPR_notes:

        Suppresses printout of interpreted input data, including information labeled as "Notes." When this
        printout is not suppressed, the data input to the analysis is echoed to the output file in an
        expanded format. Printout is suppressed until a :ref:`gopr` or :ref:`slashgo` command is read.

        Use of :ref:`nopr` is not recommended when the graphical user interface (GUI) is active. The GUI
        sometimes issues "hidden" :ref:`nopr` and :ref:`gopr` command sequences, which will countermand
        user-issued :ref:`nopr` commands, thus making the use of :ref:`nopr` in the GUI environment
        unpredictable.

        This command is valid in any processor.
