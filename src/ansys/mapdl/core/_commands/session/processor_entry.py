        .. _FINISH_notes:

        This command exits any of the Mechanical APDL processors.

        When exiting the Mechanical APDL processors, data remains intact in the database, but the database
        is not
        automatically written to a file. (Issue :ref:`save` to write the database to a file.)

        If exiting POST1 or POST26:

        * POST1: Data in the database remains intact (including the POST1 element table data, the path table
          data, the fatigue table data, and the load case pointers).

        * POST26: Data in the database remains intact, except that POST26 variables are erased and
          specification commands (such as :ref:`file`, :ref:`prtime`, and :ref:`nprint` ) are reset. Issue
          :ref:`quit` to exit the processor and bypass these exceptions.

        See :ref:`quit` for an alternate processor exit command.

        This command is valid in any processor. This command is not valid at the Begin level.
