        lab : str
            element table label:

            * ``Lab`` - Any user-defined label from the :ref:`etable` command (input in the ``Lab`` field of the

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Any unique user-defined label for use in subsequent commands and output headings. A valid label has
            a maximum of eight characters and is not a general predefined ``Item`` label. Default: An eight-
            character label formed by concatenating the first four characters of the ``Item`` and ``Comp``
            labels.

            If the same as a previous user label, the result item is included under the same label. Up to 200
            different labels can be defined.

            The following predefined labels are reserved:

            * ``REFL`` - Refills all tables previously defined with the :ref:`etable` commands (not the
              :ref:`calc` module commands) according to the latest :ref:`etable` specifications. It is convenient
              for refilling tables after the load step ( :ref:`set` ) has changed. Remaining fields are ignored.

            * ``STAT`` - Displays stored table values.

            * ``ERAS`` - Erases the entire table.

        item : str
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in the tables below. Some items also
            require a component label. Character parameters are valid. ``Item`` = ERAS erases a ``Lab``
            column.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are shown in the tables below.
            Character parameters can be used.

        option : str
            Option for storing element table data:

            * ``MIN`` - Store minimum element nodal value of the specified item component.

            * ``MAX`` - Store maximum element nodal value of the specified item component.

            * ``AVG`` - Store averaged element centroid value of the specified item component (default).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _ETABLE_notes:

        :ref:`etable` defines a table of values per element (the element table) for use in further
        processing. The element table is organized similar to a spreadsheet, with rows representing all
        selected elements and columns consisting of result items which have been moved into the table (
        ``Item``, ``Comp`` ) via :ref:`etable`. Each column of data is identified by a user-defined label (
        ``Lab`` ) for listings and displays.

        After entering the data into the element table, you are not limited to listing or displaying your
        data ( :ref:`plesol`, :ref:`presol`, etc.). You can also perform many types of operations on your
        data, such as adding or multiplying columns ( :ref:`sadd`, :ref:`smult` ), defining allowable
        stresses for safety calculations ( :ref:`sallow` ), or multiplying one column by another (
        :ref:`smult` ). For more information, see `Getting Started
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/afbRsqe0ldm.html>`_

        For `reinforcing
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/str_compreinfdirectemb.html>`_
        elements, this command displays the results of reinforcing member (individual reinforcing) selected
        via the :ref:`layer`, ``N`` command (where ``N`` is a given reinforcing member). :ref:`layer`,0
        (default) or :ref:`layer`,1 selects the first reinforcing member.

        Various results data can be stored in the element table. For example, many items for an element are
        inherently single-valued (one value per element). The single-valued items include: SERR, SDSG, TERR,
        TDSG, SENE, TENE, KENE, ASENE, PSENE, AKENE, PKENE, DENE, WEXT, AENE, JHEAT, JS, VOLU, and CENT. All
        other items are multivalued (varying over the element, such that there is a different value at each
        node). Because only one value is stored in the element table per element, an average value (based on
        the number of contributing nodes) is calculated for multivalued items. Exceptions to this averaging
        procedure are FMAG and all element force items, which represent the sum only of the contributing
        nodal values.

        Two methods of data access can be used with the :ref:`etable` command. The method you select depends
        upon the type of data that you want to store. Some results can be accessed via a generic label
        (Component Name method), while others require a label and number (Sequence Number method).

        The component name method is used to access the general element data (that is, element data which is
        generally available to most element types or groups of element types). All of the single-valued
        items and some of the more general multivalued items are accessible with the Component Name method.
        Various element results depend on the calculation method and the selected results location (
        :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`rsys`, :ref:`layer`, :ref:`shell`, and :ref:`esel` ).

        Although nodal data is readily available for listing and display ( :ref:`prnsol`, :ref:`plnsol` )
        without using the element table, you can also use the Component Name method to enter these results
        into the element table for further "worksheet" manipulation. (See `Getting Started
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/afbRsqe0ldm.html>`_  ``Item`` and
        ``Comp`` labels for the component name method is shown in :ref:`ETABLE_tab_1`. See
        :ref:`ETABLE_tab_2` for a list of selected result ( ``Item`` = SRES) ``Comp`` labels.

        The sequence number method enables you to view results for data that is not averaged (such as
        pressures at nodes, temperatures at integration points, etc.), or data that is not easily described
        in a generic fashion (such as all derived data for structural line elements and contact elements,
        all derived data for thermal line elements, layer data for layered elements, etc.). A table
        illustrating the ``Items`` (such as LS, LEPEL, LEPTH, SMISC, NMISC, SURF, etc.) and corresponding
        sequence numbers for each element is shown in the Output Data section of each element description.

        Some element table data are reported in the results coordinate system. These include all component
        results (for example, UX, UY, etc.; SX, SY, etc.). The solution writes component results in the
        database and on the results file in the solution coordinate system. When you issue the :ref:`etable`
        command, these results are then transformed into the results coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys` )
        before being stored in the element table. The default results coordinate system is global Cartesian
        ( :ref:`rsys`,0). All other data are retrieved from the database and stored in the element table
        with no coordinate transformation.

        To display the stored table values, issue the :ref:`pretab`, :ref:`pletab`, or :ref:`etable`,STAT
        command. To erase the entire table, issue :ref:`etable`,ERAS. To erase a ``Lab`` column, issue
        :ref:`etable`, ``Lab``,ERAS.

        When the GUI is enabled, if a **Delete** operation in a Define Element Table Data dialog box writes
        this command to a log file ( :file:`Jobname.LOG` or :file:`Jobname.LGW` ), the program sets ``Lab``
        = blank, ``Item`` = ERASE, and ``Comp`` = an integer number. In this case, the program has assigned
        a value of ``Comp`` that corresponds to the location of a chosen variable name in the dialog list.
        It is not intended that you type in such a location value for ``Comp`` in a session; however, a file
        that contains a GUI-generated :ref:`etable` command of this form can be used for batch input or the
        :ref:`input` command.

        The MIN and MAX options are not available for thermal elements.

        The element table data option ( ``Option`` ) is not available for all output items. See the table
        below for supported items.

        Displays items stored in the table defined with the :ref:`etable` command for the selected elements.
        For display purposes, items are assumed to be constant over the element and assigned to each of its
        nodes. Contour display lines (lines of constant value) are determined by linear interpolation within
        each element from the nodal values. These nodal values have the option of being averaged (values are
        averaged at a node whenever two or more elements connect to the same node) or not averaged
        (discontinuous). The discontinuity between contour lines of adjacent elements is an indication of
        the gradient across elements.
