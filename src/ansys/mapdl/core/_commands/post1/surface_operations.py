              plane (/CPLANE,1), NOT the view settings (/CPLANE,0)).

            * ``SPHERE`` - Surface is defined by a spherical surface centered about the working plane origin.

              extending indefinitely in the positive and negative Z directions.

        nrefine : str
            Refinement level.

            * ``For SurfType = CPLANE`` - The refinement level of the surface mesh. This will be an integer
              between 0 and 3 (default = 0). See Notes below.

            * ``For SurfType = SPHERE`` - The number of divisions along a 90° arc (minimum = 9). The default is
              9.

        radius : str
            Appropriate radius value (for INFC or SPHERE).

        tolout : str
            Tolerance value for inclusion of element facets within a prescribed volume. (for INFC)

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SUCR_notes:

        This command creates a new surface and stores the following data for that surface:

        * GCX, GCY, GCZ - global Cartesian coordinates at each point on the surface.
        * NORMX, NORMY, NORMZ - components of the unit normal at each point on the surface.
        * DA - the contributory area of each point.

        For ``SurfType`` = CPLANE, ``nRefine`` refers to the number of points that define the surface. An
        ``nRefine`` value of zero is used for points where the element face intersects the cutting plane.

        If ``SurfType`` = CPLANE and ``nRefine`` = 0, the points reside at the section cuts where the
        element intersects the cutting plane. Increasing ``nRefine`` from 0 to 1 will subdivide each surface
        facet into 4 subfacets, and increase the number of points at which results can be interpolated.

        For ``SurfType`` = CPLANE, the setting from the :ref:`efacet` command will affect the creation of
        surface facets and the quality of the fit of the surface in the model. :ref:`sucr` employs geometry
        data from PowerGraphics to aid in determining where the surface intersects the model. If
        :ref:`efacet`,1 is in effect when the :ref:`sucr` command is issued, then the curvature of high
        order elements (that is, elements with midside nodes) will be ignored. If your model contains high
        order elements, you can see a better fit for your surface if /EFACET,2 is in effect when the
        :ref:`sucr` command is issued. Currently, the :ref:`sucr` command interprets :ref:`efacet`,4 to
        mean :ref:`efacet`,2.

        For ``SurfType`` = INFC, a default tolerance of 0.01 will be applied to include the vertices of any
        facets that fall out of the cylinder definition. This tolerance increases the facet size by one
        percent to check for inclusion. Excluding facets under such a small tolerance may yield unacceptable
        (aesthetically) results. Increasing the tolerance by a larger amount (0.1 or 10%) will sometimes
        yield smother edges along the surface you create.

            Eight character name of the mapped data that forms vector 2. Sets with names Lab2X, Lab2Y, and
            Lab2Z must exist on all selected surfaces for operation to take place. For ``Oper`` = SMULT a
            scalar value or another predefined scalar item (for example, DA) can be supplied.

        offset : str
            An offset value to be applied to the resultant ``RSetName``. One value is specified for ``Oper``
            = DOT, and three values are specified for ``Oper`` = SMULT.
