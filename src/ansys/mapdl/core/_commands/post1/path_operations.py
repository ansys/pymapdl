        Parameters
        ----------
        rho : str
            In-plane (X-Y) average radius of curvature of the inside and outside surfaces of an axisymmetric
            section. If zero (or blank), a plane or 3D structure is assumed. If nonzero, an axisymmetric
            structure is assumed. Use a suitably large number (see the `Mechanical APDL Theory Reference
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_biblio.html>`_) or use -1
            for an axisymmetric straight section.

        nev : str
            Event number to be associated with these stresses (defaults to 1).

        nlod : str
            Loading number to be associated with these stresses (defaults to 1).

        kbr : int or str
            For an axisymmetric analysis ( ``RHO`` â‰  0):

            * ``0`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses

            * ``1`` - Ignore the thickness-direction bending stresses

            * ``2`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stress using the same formula as the Y (axial
              direction ) bending stress. Also use the same formula for the shear stress.

        .. _FSSECT_notes:

        Calculates and stores the total linearized stress components at the ends of a section path (
        :ref:`path` ) (as defined by the first two nodes with the :ref:`ppath` command). The path must be
        entirely within the selected elements (that is, there must not be any element gaps along the path).
        Stresses are stored according to the fatigue event number and loading number specified. Locations
        (one for each node) are associated with those previously defined for these nodes (FL) or else they
        are automatically defined. Stresses are separated into six total components (SX through SXZ) and six
        membrane-plus-bending (SX through SXZ) components. The temperature at each end point and the current
        time are also stored along with the total stress components. Calculations are made from the stresses
        currently in the database (last :ref:`set` or :ref:`lcase` command). Stresses are stored as section
        coordinate components if axisymmetric or as global Cartesian coordinate components otherwise,
        regardless of the active results coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys` ). The FSLIST command may be used
        to list stresses. The FS command can be used to modify stored stresses. See also the :ref:`prsect`
        and :ref:`plsect` commands for similar calculations.

        .. _PATH_notes:

        The :ref:`path` command is used to define parameters for establishing a path. The path geometry is

        may be active for data interpolation ( :ref:`pdef` ) and data operations ( :ref:`pcalc`, etc.). Path
        geometry points and data are stored in memory while in POST1. If you leave POST1, the path
        information is erased. Path geometry and data may be saved in a file by archiving the data using the
        :ref:`pasave` command. Path information may be restored by retrieving the data using the
        :ref:`paresu` command.

        For overlapping nodes, the lowest numbered node is assigned to the path.

        Defines and interpolates a labeled path item along a predefined path ( :ref:`path` ). Path item
        results are in the global Cartesian coordinate directions unless transformed ( :ref:`rsys` ). A path
        item must be defined before it can be used with other path operations. Additional path items may be
        defined from the :ref:`pvect`, :ref:`pcalc`, :ref:`pdot`, and :ref:`pcross` commands. Path items may
        be listed ( :ref:`prpath` ) or displayed ( :ref:`plpath`, :ref:`plpagm` ). A maximum number of path
        items permitted is established by the ``nSets`` argument specified with the :ref:`path` command.

        When you create the first path item ( :ref:`pdef` or :ref:`pvect` ), the program automatically
        interpolates four path items which are used to describe the geometry of the path. These predefined
        items are the position of the interpolated path points (labels XG, YG, and ZG) in global Cartesian
        coordinates, and the path length (label S). For alternate methods of mapping the path geometry (to
        include, for example, material discontinuity) see the :ref:`pmap` command. These items may also be
        listed or displayed with the :ref:`prpath`, :ref:`plpath`, and :ref:`plpagm` commands.

        If specifying that load case operations act on principal/equivalent stresses ( :ref:`sumtype`,PRIN),
        derived quantities (principal and equivalent stresses/strains) will be zero for path plots. A
        typical use for such a case involves mode combinations in a response spectrum analysis.

        The number of interpolation points on the path is defined by the ``nDiv`` argument on the
        :ref:`path` command. See `Mapping Nodal and Element Data onto the Path
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_post3.html#LazAk2efjw>`_
        :ref:`pdef`,STAT to list the path item labels. Use :ref:`pdef`,CLEAR to erase all labeled path
        items, except the path geometry items (XG, YG, ZG, S).

        rho : str
            In-plane (X-Y) average radius of curvature of the inside and outside surfaces of an axisymmetric

        kbr : int or str
            Through-thickness bending stresses key for an axisymmetric analysis ( ``RHO`` â‰  0):

            * ``0`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses.

            * ``1`` - Ignore the thickness-direction bending stresses.

            * ``2`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stress using the same formula as the Y (axial
              direction ) bending stress. Also use the same formula for the shear stress.

        kbr3d : int or str
            Through-thickness bending stresses key for 3D geometry ( ``RHO`` = 0):

            * ``0`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses.

            * ``1`` - Ignore the following thickness-direction bending stresses: SX, SXY, SXZ

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PLSECT_notes:

        Calculates and displays the membrane and membrane-plus-bending linearized stresses (as described for
        the :ref:`prsect` command) along a path section ( :ref:`path` ) as a graph. The path section is
        defined by two points specified with the :ref:`ppath` command. For linearized stress calculations,
        the path must be defined with nodes. The path must be entirely within the selected elements (that
        is, there must not be any element gaps along the path). The total stress (equivalent to the
        :ref:`plpath` display) is also displayed. This command always uses 48 divisions along the path,
        regardless of the number of divisions defined by :ref:`path`.

        In analyses of 3D models with ``RHO`` = 0, ignoring the calculated out-of-plane bending stresses is
        recommended in some scenarios when determining the linearized bending stresses. If ``KBR3D`` = 0,
        all calculated stresses are included in the linearized bending-stress calculations. If ``KBR3D`` =
        1, these calculated out-of-plane bending stresses are ignored in the linearized bending-stress
        calculations: SX, SXY, SXZ. (The principal bending-stress calculation for S1, S2, S3, SINT, and SEQV
        is performed with these zeroed components.)

        Portions of this command are not supported by PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER).

            * ``ACCURATE`` - Map geometry using a small division at the beginning and end of each segment. This
              gives you accurate derivatives, integrals, tangents, and normals for curves which do not have
              continuous slopes at the specified points. To create nonuniform divisions, the ``nDiv`` argument of
              the :ref:`path` command must be greater than 2.

        discon : str
            Sets mapping for discontinuities in the field. The divisions are modified to put a point just
            before and just after the discontinuity. The valid label is MAT, for a material discontinuity.
            No discontinuity is the default. Discontinuity mapping involves the NOAV option on the
            :ref:`pdef` command.

        cs : str
            The coordinate system for interpolation of the path between the previous point and this point.
            Omit this argument if you wish to use the currently active ( :ref:`csys` ) coordinate system. If

            * ``2`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stress using the same formula as the Y (axial
              direction ) bending stress. Also use the same formula for the shear stress.

        kbr3d : int or str
            Through-thickness bending stresses key for 3D geometry ( ``RHO`` = 0):

            * ``0`` - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses.

            * ``1`` - Ignore the following thickness-direction bending stresses: SX, SXY, SXZ

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PRSECT_notes:

        You may want to linearize the stresses through a section and separate them into categories for
        various code calculations. :ref:`prsect` calculates and reports linearized stresses along a section
        path. The linearized stresses are also separated into membrane, bending, membrane plus bending,
        peak, and total stress categories.

        Define your section path ( :ref:`path` and :ref:`ppath` with the NODE option). Your path must lie
        entirely within the selected set of elements (that is, no element gaps may exist along the path).
        :ref:`path` and :ref:`ppath` only retrieve the two end nodes; the path data is not retained. The
        section path is defined by the two end nodes, and by 47 intermediate points that are automatically
        determined by linear interpolation in the active display coordinate system ( :ref:`dsys` ). The
        number and location of the intermediate points are not affected by the number of divisions set by
        :ref:`path`,, ``nDiv``.

        Your linearized component stress values are obtained by interpolating each element``s average corner
        nodal values along the section path points within each path element. :ref:`prsect` reports the
        linearized component and principal stresses for each stress category at the beginning, mid-length,
        and end of the section path. :ref:`prpath` can be used to report the total stresses at the
        intermediate points.

        Section paths can be through any set of solid (2D plane, 2D axisymmetric or 3D) elements; however,
        section paths are usually defined to be through the thickness of the structure and normal to the
        inner and outer structure surfaces. Section paths (in-plane only) can also be defined for shell
        element structures.

        If the ``RHO`` option is set to indicate the axisymmetric option (non-zero), :ref:`prsect` reports
        the linearized stresses in the section coordinates (SX - along the path, SY - normal to the path,
        and SZ - hoop direction). If the ``RHO`` option is set to indicate the 2D planar or 3D option (zero
        or blank), :ref:`prsect` reports the linearized stresses in the active results coordinate system (
        :ref:`rsys` ]. If the ``RHO`` option is zero or blank and either :ref:`rsys`, SOLU or :ref:`rsys`,
        -1 are active, the linearized stresses are calculated and reported in the global Cartesian
        coordinate system.

        Linearized stress calculations should be performed in a rectangular coordinate system. Principal
        stresses are recalculated from the component stresses and are invariant with the coordinate system
        as long as SX is in the same direction at all points along the defined path. The :ref:`plsect`
        command displays the linearized stresses in the same coordinate system as reported by :ref:`prsect`.

        Stress components through the section are linearized by a line integral method and separated into
        constant membrane stresses, bending stresses varying linearly between end points, and peak stresses
        (defined as the difference between the actual (total) stress and the membrane plus bending
        combination).

        For nonaxisymmetric structures, the bending stresses are calculated such that the neutral axis is at
        the midpoint of the path. Axisymmetric results include the effects of both the radius of revolution
        (automatically determined from the node locations) and the in-plane average radius of curvature of
        the section surfaces (user input).

        For axisymmetric cases, Mechanical APDL calculates the linearized bending stress in the through-
        thickness
        direction as the difference between the total outer fiber stress and the membrane stress if ``KBR``
        = 0. The calculation method may be conservative for locations with a highly nonlinear variation of
        stress in the through-thickness direction. Alternatively, you can specify ``KBR`` = 2 to calculate
        the bending stress using the same method and formula as the Y (axial direction) bending stress. For
        more information, see the discussion of `axisymmetric cases
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_post4.html#eqa0e44427-d764-4797-9c99-13f056f2227c>`_
        (specifically ) in the `Mechanical APDL Theory Reference
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_biblio.html>`_.

        In analyses of 3D models with ``RHO`` = 0, ignoring the calculated out-of-plane bending stresses is
        recommended in some scenarios when determining the linearized bending stresses. If ``KBR3D`` = 0,
        all calculated stresses are included in the linearized bending-stress calculations. If ``KBR3D`` =
        1, these calculated out-of-plane bending stresses are ignored in the linearized bending-stress
        calculations: SX, SXY, SXZ. (The principal bending-stress calculation for S1, S2, S3, SINT, and SEQV
        is performed with these zeroed components.)
