        Mechanical APDL Command: `ANCYC <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ANCYC.html>`_

        **Command default:**

        .. _ANCYC_default:

        The default :ref:`ancyc` command (issuing the command with no arguments) specifies these implicit
        argument values: :ref:`ancyc`, 18, 0, 0.1

        Parameters
        ----------
        numframes : str
            The number of plot frames for the animation. Valid values range from 5 through 36. The default
            is 18. A low value (because it specifies fewer graphical frames) produces a rougher animation
            but loads faster. A high value produces a smoother animation but requires more time to load.

        kcycl : int or str
            The animation mode:

            * ``0`` - Continuous animation cycle (forward-reverse-forward).

            * ``1`` - Discontinuous animation cycle (forward-reset-forward). This option is the default.



        delay : str
            The time delay (in seconds) between animation frames. Valid values range from 0.1 through 1.0.
            The default is 0.1 seconds, which produces a seemingly real-time animation. A higher value
            produces a slower animation.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _ANCYC_notes:

        The :ref:`ancyc` command is valid in a `modal cyclic symmetry analysis
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycmodalans.html#cycsym_postproc_modal>`_
        only.

        The command animates the cyclic symmetry mode shape plot in the General Post Processor (
        :ref:`post1` ). When you issue a nodal- or element-results plot command (for example, :ref:`plnsol`,
        :ref:`plesol`, or :ref:`pldisp` ) and then issue the :ref:`ancyc` command, Mechanical APDL applies a
        traveling wave animation to the mode shape plot.

        Each frame of the animation is created by expanding the cyclic symmetry mode shape at increasing
        phase angles (via the :ref:`cycexpand` command) starting at zero in equal increments over 360Â°. The
        phase-angle increment is 360 / ``NUMFRAMES``.

        The animation display shows the traveling wave of the result quantity being plotted. The traveling
        wave animation is applicable only to nodal diameters (harmonic indices) greater than 0 and less than
        ``N`` / 2 (where ``N`` is the number of cyclic sectors in the model).

            * ``1`` - Range of load step data.

            * ``2`` - Range of results data.

            The range minimum value. If left blank or 0, defaults to the first data point.

            The range maximum value. If left blank or 0, defaults to the last data point.

            The increment between result data (defaults to 1).

        frclst : str
            Key to force the last sub step in a selected load step to be included in the animation (defaults
            to 0).

        autocont : str
            A value of 1 enables automatic scaling of contour values based on the overall subset range of

        .. _ANHARM_notes:

        :ref:`anharm` invokes a Mechanical APDL macro which produces an animated sequence of:

        * Time-harmonic results in the case of a harmonic analysis ( :ref:`antype`,HARMIC)

        * Complex mode shapes in the case of a modal analysis ( :ref:`antype`,MODAL).

        In both cases, the results are those of the last plot action (for example, :ref:`plnsol`,B,SUM).

        The animation converts the complex solution variables (real and imaginary sets) into time varying
        results over one period. For example, if ``NFRAM`` = 12, then the frame captures are in increments
        of 30 degree phase angles.

        A second set of ``NFRAM`` frames will be generated for damped eigenmodes from complex eigensolvers
        to visualize any exponential decay or growth of the oscillations. The second set generated will
        display frames from the period number specified by ``NPERIOD``.

        In a CMS analysis, the :ref:`anharm` command can be used after the CMS expansion pass or the use
        pass. To use :ref:`anharm` after the expansion pass, you must indicate whether a modal analysis or a
        harmonic analysis was performed in the CMS use pass by setting ``CMS_ANTYPE`` to either MODAL or
        HARMIC. If the use pass was a modal analysis, you must also set the ``CMS_MODOPT`` field to indicate
        the mode extraction method that was used (UNSYM, DAMP, or QRDAMP). If ``CMS_MODOPT`` = QRDAMP, it is
        assumed that ``CPXMOD`` was set to ON in the :ref:`modopt` command to request complex eigenmodes. If
        the :ref:`anharm` command is used after the use pass, it is not necessary to set the ``CMS_ANTYPE``
        or ``CMS_MODOPT`` arguments.

            Number of cycles associated with the animation (defaults to 5 in non-GUI mode only)

        kcycl : int or str
            Animation mode:

            * ``0`` - Continuous animation cycle (forward-reverse-forward-etc.) (default).

            * ``1`` - Discontinuous animation cycle (forward-reset-forward-etc.).

        delay : str
            Time delay (seconds) between animation frames (defaults to 0.1 seconds).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _ANIM_notes:

        Use the :ref:`anim` command to create animations for linear problems only. The command uses the
        currently displayed picture based on one particular data set from the results file, and linearly
        interpolates that data into different sets, displaying pictures of each interpolated data set in
        sequence to create animation. For information about creating animations for nonlinear problems, see
        the :ref:`andata` command.

        This command is device-dependent.


        Do not resize the graphic while animation is in progress; doing so can result in distorted plots.

        For more information, see the :ref:`seg` command for details about segment storage, and the
        :ref:`ancntr` macro for a convenient method of storing graphics frames in terminal memory segments.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time : str
            Total Trace Time (seconds) (defaults to 0, which is the full particle trace).

            Particle spacing in seconds (defaults to 0).

            Particle offset in seconds (defaults to 0). It is used internally in the :ref:`anflow` macro to
            produce an animation of charged particle motion in an electric or magnetic field.

        size : str

        .. _TRTIME_notes:

        The :ref:`trtime` command varies the type of :ref:`pltrac` display produced. Charged particle traces
        follow a particle's path in the forward and backward direction of travel. The DOF selected
        determines the color of the particle trace. ``SPACING`` defines the particle spacing in seconds from
        adjacent particles in the stream line. ``OFFSET`` defines the offset in seconds from the spacing set
        by the ``SPACING`` argument.

        ``LENGTH`` defines the particle length fraction. The default value (.1), means the particle occupies
        10% of the trace region, and the other 90% is a color-coded line.

        ``SIZE`` sets the radius of the particle. Use ``SPACING``, ``OFFSET`` and ``LENGTH`` only when
        ``SIZE`` is nonzero (that is, the particle is bigger than the line).
