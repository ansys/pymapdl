        Parameters
        ----------
        item : str
            Label identifying the item to be sorted on. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some
            items also require a component label.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.

        order : int or str
            Order of sort operation:

            * ``0`` - Sort into descending order.

            * ``1`` - Sort into ascending order.

        kabs : int or str
            Absolute value key:

            * ``0`` - Sort according to real value.

            * ``1`` - Sort according to absolute value.

        numb : str
            Number of nodal data records to be sorted in ascending or descending order ( ``ORDER`` ) before
            sort is stopped (remainder will be in unsorted sequence) (defaults to all nodes).

        sel : str
            Allows selection of nodes in the sorted field.

            * ``(blank)`` - No selection (default).

            * ``SELECT`` - Select the nodes in the sorted list.

        .. _NSORT_notes:

        Values are in the active coordinate system ( :ref:`csys` for input data or :ref:`rsys` for results
        data). Various element results also depend upon the recalculation method and the selected results
        location ( :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`rsys`, :ref:`shell`, :ref:`esel`, and :ref:`nsel` ). If simultaneous
        load cases are stored, the last sorted sequence formed from any load case applies to all load cases.
        Use :ref:`nusort` to restore the original order. This command is not valid with PowerGraphics.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : str
            Label identifying the item. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some items also
            require a component label.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.

        kund : int or str
            Undisplaced shape key:

            * ``0`` - Do not overlay undeformed structure display.

            * ``1`` - Overlay displaced contour plot with undeformed display (appearance is system-dependent).

            * ``2`` - Overlay displaced contour plot with undeformed edge display (appearance is system-

            negative scaling factor.

        avg : int or str
            Specifies whether results of reinforcing members within the same reinforcing element are smoothed:

            * ``0`` - Disable smoothing.

            * ``1`` - Enable smoothing (default), displaying constant results of reinforcing members if the base
              elements are low-order, and linear results when the base elements are high-order.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PLESOL_notes:

        :ref:`plesol` displays the solution results as element contours discontinuous across element
        boundaries for the selected elements.

        For example, :ref:`plesol`,S,X displays the X component of stress S (that is, the SX stress
        component). Various element results depend on the calculation method and the selected results
        location ( :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`rsys`, and :ref:`esel` ).

        Contours are determined by linear interpolation within each element, unaffected by the surrounding
        elements; that is, no nodal averaging occurs. The discontinuity between contours of adjacent
        elements is an indication of the gradient across elements. Component results are displayed in the
        active results coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys` [default is global Cartesian]).

        To display items not available via :ref:`plesol` (such as line element results), see :ref:`etable`
        and :ref:`pletab`.

        For PowerGraphics displays ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER), results are plotted only for the model exterior
        surface. Items not supported by PowerGraphics are noted in :ref:`plesol_tab_1`.

        The results displayed by :ref:`plesol` are unaffected by any requested nodal-averaged results (
        :ref:`outres`,NAR). For more information, see `Nodal-Averaged Results
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_

        For ``Item`` = SRES, selected result ( :ref:`osresult` ) values are output. See :ref:`PLESOL_tab_2`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : str
            Label identifying the item. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some items also
            require a component label.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.

        kund : int or str
            Undisplaced shape key:

            * ``0`` - Do not overlay undeformed structure display.

            * ``1`` - Overlay displaced contour plot with undeformed display (appearance is system-dependent).

            * ``2`` - Overlay displaced contour plot with undeformed edge display (appearance is system-
              dependent).

        fact : str
            Scale factor for 2D display for contact items. Default value is 1. A negative scaling factor
            inverts the display.

        fileid : str
            The file index number (obtained via :ref:`nldiag`,NRRE,ON). Valid only for ``Item`` = NRRE.

        avg : str
            Specifies whether random acoustic results are averaged. Valid only for ``Item`` = U and PRES.

            * ``(blank)`` - No averaging (default).

            * ``AVG`` - Display averaged results for random acoustics.

        datakey : str
            Key to specify which data is plotted:

            * ``AUTO`` - `Nodal-averaged results
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_ are
              used, if available; otherwise, the element-based data is used, if available. (Default.)

            * ``ESOL`` - Only element-based results are used. If they are not available, the command is ignored.

            * ``NAR`` - Only nodal-averaged results are used. If they are not available, the command is ignored.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PLNSOL_notes:

        :ref:`plnsol` displays the solution results as continuous contours across element boundaries for the
        selected nodes and elements.

        For example, :ref:`plnsol`,S,X displays the X component of stress S (that is, the SX stress
        component). Various element results depend upon the recalculation method and the selected results
        location ( :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`rsys`, :ref:`layer`, :ref:`shell`, and :ref:`nsel` ).

        Contours are determined by linear interpolation within each element from the nodal values, averaged
        at a node whenever two or more elements connect to the same node. (The exception is FMAG, which is
        summed at the node.)

        For `reinforcing
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/str_compreinfdirectemb.html>`_
        elements (REINF ``nnn`` ), contours are determined by interpolation within each reinforcing member
        of reinforcing elements from the results of the base elements. Element results of members within the
        same reinforcing element are smoothed based on the order of its base element. :ref:`plnsol` displays
        constant results for a reinforcing element if the base elements are low-order, and linear results
        when the base elements are high-order.

        For PowerGraphics displays ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER), results are plotted for the model exterior
        surface only. Items not supported by PowerGraphics are noted in :ref:`plnsol_tab_1`.

        To plot midside nodes, first issue :ref:`efacet`,2.

        If `nodal-averaged results
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_ (
        :ref:`outres`,NAR or another nodal-averaged label) are in the database, then :ref:`plnsol` uses the
        nodal-averaged data for the applicable items (S, EPEL, EPPL, EPCR, EPTH, EPSW) by default. You can
        change this behavior via the ``DataKey`` argument. Keep these points in mind when using nodal-
        averaged results:

        * The :ref:`layer` and :ref:`rsys`,SOLU commands are not valid with nodal-averaged results. If these
          commands are used, the element solution is plotted instead if applicable.

        * Issuing :ref:`esel` before plotting nodal-averaged results has no effect on the output.

        * PowerGraphics is supported. The output is equivalent to the full model graphics output, but only
          the appropriate surface nodes are plotted. See `Postprocessing Nodal-Averaged Results
          <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#>`_

        For ``Item`` = SRES, selected result ( :ref:`osresult` ) values are output. See :ref:`PLNSOL_tab_2`.

        Notes
        -----
        When a structure is rotating and the Coriolis or gyroscopic effect is taken into account (
        :ref:`coriolis` ), nodes lying on the rotation axis generally exhibit an elliptical orbital motion.
        The :ref:`plorb` command displays the `orbit
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_rot/Hlp_G_ROTTERMINOLOGY.html#rotgloss1>`_
        of each rotating node as well as the deformed shape at time t = 0 (the real part of the solution).

        To print the characteristics of the orbital path traversed by each node, issue the :ref:`prorb`
        command.

        The :ref:`plorb` command is valid for line elements (such as ``BEAM188``, ``BEAM189``, ``PIPE288``,
        and ``PIPE289`` ). :ref:`plorb` is not supported for beam elements with the warping degree of
        freedom activated.

        Your model must also involve a rotational velocity ( :ref:`omega` or :ref:`cmomega` ) with Coriolis
        enabled ( :ref:`coriolis` ).

        Because orbit data is written in the database, a :ref:`set` command must be issued after the
        :ref:`plorb` command to ensure proper output for subsequent postprocessing commands.

        The coordinate system for displaying nodal results must be global Cartesian ( :ref:`rsys`, ``KCN`` =
        0). :ref:`plorb` is not supported if nodes are rotated in a cylindrical coordinate system.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : str
            Predefined vector item (from :ref:`plvect_tab_1` below) or a label identifying the i-component
            of a user-defined vector.

        lab2 : str
            Label identifying the j-component of a user-defined vector. In most cases, this value must be
            blank if ``Item`` is selected from :ref:`plvect_tab_1`. Individual principal stresses ( ``Item``
            = S) or principal strains ( ``Item`` = EP ``xx`` ) may be plotted by specifying the value as 1,
            2, or 3.

        lab3 : str
            Label identifying the k-component of a user-defined vector. Must be blank if ``Item`` is
            selected from list below or for 2D user defined vector.

        labp : str
            Label assigned to resultant vector for display labeling (defaults to ``Item`` ).

        mode : str
            Vector or raster mode override key:

            * ``(blank)`` - Use the setting of ``KEY`` on the :ref:`device` command.

            * ``RAST`` - Use raster mode for :ref:`plvect` displays.

            * ``VECT`` - Use vector mode for :ref:`plvect` displays.

        loc : str
            Vector location for display of field element results:

            * ``ELEM`` - Display at element centroid (default).

            * ``NODE`` - Display at element nodes.

            Nodal results quantities will only be displayed at nodes, not at element centroids.

        edge : str
            Edge display override key:

            * ``(blank)`` - Use the setting of Key on the :ref:`edge` command.

            * ``OFF`` - Deactivate the edge display.

            * ``ON`` - Activate the edge display.

        kund : int or str
            Undisplaced shape key:

            * ``0`` - Display vectors on undeformed mesh or geometry.

            * ``1`` - Display vectors on deformed mesh or geometry.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PLVECT_notes:

        Displays various solution results as vectors (arrows) for the selected nodes and/or elements
        (elements must contain at least three nodes that are not colinear). For example, :ref:`plvect`,U
        displays the displacement vector for all selected nodes. For section displays ( :ref:`slashtype` ),
        the vectors are shown only on the section face (that is, cutting plane). The :ref:`plvect` display
        of principal strains and stresses ( ``Item`` = S, EPTO, EPEL, EPPL, EPCR, or EPTH) on a "cut" of the
        model ( :ref:`slashtype`,,1,5,7,8, or 9) is not supported. The resulting plot displays the vectors
        on all selected elements, not on just the sliced surface. See the :ref:`vscale` command to scale
        vector lengths. Vector magnitudes may be shown as a contour display with the :ref:`plnsol` command.
        Various results also depend upon the recalculation method and the selected results location (
        :ref:`layer`, :ref:`shell`, and :ref:`nsel` ).

        Items may be selected from a set of recognized vector labels ( ``Item`` ) or a vector may be defined
        from up to three scalar labels ( ``Item``, ``Lab2``, ``Lab3`` ). Scalar labels may be user-defined
        with the :ref:`etable` command. The vectors appear on an element display as arrows showing the
        relative magnitude of the vector and its direction. The predefined items will be shown either at the
        node or at the element centroid, depending on what item is being displayed and depending on the
        ``Loc`` setting. User defined :ref:`etable` items will be shown at the element centroid, regardless
        of the ``Loc`` setting. Stress vectors appear as arrows at the element centroid, with the arrowheads
        pointing away from each other for tension and toward each other for compression.

        For PowerGraphics, vector arrow displays are generated in Global Cartesian ( :ref:`rsys` = 0). All
        subsequent displays will revert to your original coordinate system.

        When vector mode is active ( ``Mode`` = VECT), use the Z-buffered display type ( :ref:`slashtype`
        ,,6) to maximize speed of :ref:`plvect` plots (other hidden display types may make plotting slow).
        For PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER), the items marked with [ :ref:`plvect_tab3-43note1` ] are
        not supported by PowerGraphics.

        It is possible to plot principal stresses ( ``Item`` = S) or principal strains ( ``Item`` = EP
        ``xx`` ) individually. To do so, specify a ``Lab2`` value of 1, 2, or 3. For example, the following
        are valid commands:

        * :ref:`plvect`,S,1,,,VECT,ELEM,ON,0
        * :ref:`plvect`,EPEL,3,,,VECT,NODE,ON,0

        .. _PRENERGY_Notes:

        The :ref:`prenergy` command prints out either the total energies of the entire model or the energies
        of the components depending on the ``Cname1`` specification.

        Only existing components based on elements (defined with the :ref:`cm` command) are supported when
        component energies are listed.

        Damping energy (DENE) and work done by external loads (WEXT) are available only if the following
        were set prior to the analysis solution: ``EngCalc`` = YES on the :ref:`trnopt`, :ref:`hrout` or
        :ref:`mxpand` command; and ``Item`` = VENG, ESOL, or ALL on the :ref:`outres` command.

        If ``EngCalc`` = YES on the :ref:`hrout` or :ref:`mxpand` command, average, amplitude, and peak
        values are returned for potential (SENE) and kinetic (KENE) energies.

        The energy values can be retrieved using the :ref:`get` command with ``Entity`` = PRENERGY.

        This command applies to structural elements only.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PRESOL_notes:

        :ref:`presol` prints the solution results for the selected elements in the sorted sequence.

        For example, :ref:`presol`,S prints the stress items SX, SY, SZ, SXY, SYZ, and SXZ for the node
        locations of the element. Various element results depend on the calculation method ( :ref:`avprin`
        ).

        Component results are in the global Cartesian coordinate directions unless transformed ( :ref:`rsys`
        ).

        Shell elements print values at the top, then bottom of the element (or layer). If KEYOPT(8) = 2 (for
        ``SHELL181``, ``SHELL208``, ``SHELL209``, ``SHELL281``, or ``ELBOW290`` ), the results are printed
        in the order TOP, BOT and then MID of each element, (or layer). The MID value is the actual value to
        the results file.

        Items are listed as columns of a table versus element number. An exception occurs for item ELEM,
        which uses an element format (where all applicable line element results are listed per element)
        instead of a tabular format.

        You can issue :ref:`force` to define which component of the nodal load is to be used (static,
        damping, inertia, or total).

        To print items not available via :ref:`presol` (such as line element results), see :ref:`etable` and
        :ref:`pretab`.

        For PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER), results are listed only for the element surface. Items
        not supported by PowerGraphics are noted in :ref:`presol_tab_1`.

        The results printed by :ref:`presol` are unaffected by any requested nodal-averaged results (
        :ref:`outres`,NAR). For more information, see `Nodal-Averaged Results
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_

        For ``Item`` = SRES, selected result components ( :ref:`osresult` ) are output. See

        tol : int or str
            Tolerance value about zero within which loads are not printed, as follows:

            * ``> 0`` - Relative tolerance about zero within which loads are not printed. In this case, the tolerance is ``TOL`` \* ``Load``, where ``Load`` is the absolute value of the maximum load on the selected nodes.

            * ``0`` - Print all nodal loads.

            * ``> 0`` - Absolute tolerance about zero within which loads are not printed.

            Defaults to 1.0E-9 times the absolute value of the maximum load on the selected nodes.

        item : str
            Selected set of nodes.

            * ``(blank)`` - Prints the summed element nodal loads for all selected nodes (default), excluding
              contact elements.

            * ``CONT`` - Prints the summed element nodal loads for contact nodes only.

            * ``BOTH`` - Prints the summed element nodal loads for all selected nodes, including contact nodes.

        Notes

        .. _PRNLD_notes:

        Prints the summed element nodal loads (forces, moments, heat flows, flux, etc.) for the selected
        nodes in the sorted sequence. Results are in the global Cartesian coordinate directions unless
        transformed ( :ref:`rsys` ). Zero values (within a tolerance range) are not printed. Loads applied
        to a constrained degree of freedom are not included. The :ref:`force` command can be used to define
        which component of the nodal load is to be used (static, damping, inertia, or total).

        By default, :ref:`prnld` excludes elements ``TARGE169`` - ``CONTA177``. Setting ``ITEM`` = CONT will
        only account for nodal forces on selected contact elements ( ``CONTA172``, ``CONTA174``,
        ``CONTA175``, and ``CONTA177`` ). Setting ``ITEM`` = BOTH will account for nodal forces on all
        selected nodes, including contact nodes.

        **Using PRNLD in a Spectrum or PSD Analysis ( ANTYPE, SPECTR)**
        When using :ref:`prnld` in a spectrum analysis (after the combination file has been input through
        :ref:`input`,,MCOM and when :ref:`spopt` has not been issued with ``Elcalc`` = YES during the
        spectrum analysis), or in a PSD analysis when postprocessing 1-sigma results (loadstep 3, 4, or 5),
        the following message will display in the printout header:

        (Spectrum analysis summation is used)

        This message means that the summation of the element nodal forces is performed prior to the
        combination of those forces. In this case, :ref:`rsys` does not apply. The forces are in the nodal
        coordinate systems, and the vector sum is always printed in the global coordinate system.

        The spectrum analysis summation is available when the element results are written to the mode file,
        :file:`Jobname.mode` ( ``MSUPkey`` = Yes on the :ref:`mxpand` command).

        Because modal displacements cannot be used to calculate contact element nodal forces, ``ITEM`` does
        not apply to spectrum and PSD analyses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : str
            Label identifying the item. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some items also
            require a component label.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.
            Default = COMP.

        avg : str
            Specifies whether random acoustic results are averaged. Valid only for ``Item`` = U and PRES.

            * ``(blank)`` - No averaging (default).

            * ``AVG`` - Print averaged results for random acoustics.

        datakey : str
            Key to specify which data is printed:

            * ``ESOL`` - Only element-based results are used. If they are not available, the command is ignored.

            * ``NAR`` - Only nodal-averaged results are used. If they are not available, the command is ignored.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PRNSOL_notes:

        Prints the nodal solution results for the selected nodes in the sorted sequence. For `reinforcing
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/str_compreinfdirectemb.html>`_
        elements (REINF ``nnn`` ), results are printed at intersection points of reinforcing elements and
        base elements.

        For example, :ref:`prnsol`,U,X prints the X component of displacement vector U (that is, the UX
        degree of freedom).

        Component results are in the global Cartesian coordinate directions unless transformed ( :ref:`rsys`
        ).

        Various element results also depend upon the recalculation method and the selected results location
        ( :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`rsys`, :ref:`layer`, :ref:`shell`, and :ref:`nsel` ).

        If :ref:`layer` is issued, the resulting output is listed in full graphics mode (
        :ref:`graphics`,FULL).

        You can define which component of the nodal load (static, damping, inertia, or total) should be used
        ( :ref:`force` ).

        PowerGraphics can affect your nodal solution listings. For PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER),
        results are listed for the model exterior surfaces only.

        When shell element types are present, results are output on a surface-by-surface basis. For shell
        elements (such as ``SHELL181`` or ``SHELL281`` ), and for ``ELBOW290``, printed output is for both
        the top and bottom surfaces. For solid elements such as ``SOLID185``, the output is averaged for
        each surface and printed as follows:

        * **Node at a vertex:** Three lines are output (one printed line for each surface).

        * **Node on an edge:** Two lines are output (one printed line for each surface).

        * **Nodes on a face:** One value is output.

        * **Nodes interior to the volume:** No printed values are output.

        If a node is common to more than one element, or if a geometric discontinuity exists, several
        conflicting listings may result. For example, a corner node incorporating results from solid
        elements and shell elements could yield as many as nine different results; the printed output would
        be averages at the top and bottom for the three shell surfaces plus averages at the three surfaces
        for the solid, for a total of nine lines of output. The program does not average result listings
        across geometric discontinuities when shell element types are present. It is important to analyze
        the listings at discontinuities to ascertain the significance of each set of data.

        When only `reinforcing
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/str_compreinfdirectemb.html>`_
        elements (REINF ``nnn`` ) are selected, results are listed for intersection points of reinforcing
        elements and base elements. Prints include coordinates of intersection points in global Cartesian
        coordinate system and results. Results are interpolated from the results of base elements. If a
        point is common to more than one reinforcing element, or reinforcing member within one reinforcing
        element, averaged results are printed. Prints also include minimum and maximum values.

        The printed output for full graphics ( :ref:`graphics`,FULL) averages results at the node. For shell
        elements, the default for display is TOP so that the results for the top of the shell are averaged
        with the other elements attached to that node.

        If :ref:`nsort`, :ref:`esort` or :ref:`eshape` is issued with PowerGraphics enabled (
        :ref:`graphics`,POWER), :ref:`prnsol` behaves as though full graphics mode is enabled (
        :ref:`graphics`,FULL).

        Items not supported by PowerGraphics are noted in :ref:`prnsol_tab_1`.

        For ``Item`` = SRES, selected result component ( :ref:`osresult` ) values are output. See
        :ref:`PRNSOL_tab_2`.

        To print midside nodes, first issue :ref:`efacet`,2.

        To learn more about the specific behaviors of :ref:`prnsol` in a cyclic symmetry analysis and
        printing results for nodes at cyclic edges, see `Using the /CYCEXPAND Command
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cycsym/advcycpost.html#>`_

        If `nodal-averaged results
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_ (
        :ref:`outres`,NAR or another nodal-averaged label) are in the database, then :ref:`prnsol` uses the
        nodal-averaged data for the applicable items (S, EPEL, EPPL, EPCR, EPTH, EPSW) by default. You can
        change this behavior via the ``DataKey`` argument. Keep these points in mind when using nodal-
        averaged results:

        * The :ref:`layer` and :ref:`rsys`,SOLU commands are not valid with nodal-averaged results. If these
          commands are used, the element solution is printed instead if applicable.

        * Issuing :ref:`esel` before printing nodal-averaged results has no effect on the output.

        * PowerGraphics is supported. The output is equivalent to the full model graphics output, but only
          the appropriate surface nodes are printed. See `Postprocessing Nodal-Averaged Results
          <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#>`_

        Notes
        -----
        When a structure is rotating and the Coriolis or gyroscopic effect is taken into account (
        :ref:`coriolis` ), nodes lying on the rotation axis generally exhibit an elliptical orbital motion.
        The :ref:`prorb` command prints out the `orbit
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_rot/Hlp_G_ROTTERMINOLOGY.html#rotgloss1>`_
        characteristics A, B, PSI, PHI, YMAX, ZMAX, and Whirl of each rotating node, where

        * A is the semi-major axis.
        * B is the semi-minor axis.
        * PSI is the angle between local y axis and major axis.
        * PHI is the angle between initial position (t = 0) and major axis.
        * YMAX is the maximum displacement along local y axis.
        * ZMAX is the maximum displacement along local z axis.
        * Whirl is the direction of an orbital motion (BW for backward whirl and FW for forward whirl).

        Angles PSI and PHI are in degrees and within the range of -180 through +180.

        To display the characteristics of the orbital path traversed by each node, issue the :ref:`plorb`
        command.

        The :ref:`prorb` command is valid for line elements (such as ``BEAM188``, ``BEAM189``, ``PIPE288``,
        and ``PIPE289`` ). :ref:`prorb` is not supported for beam elements with the warping degree of
        freedom activated.

        Your model must also involve a rotational velocity ( :ref:`omega` or :ref:`cmomega` ) with Coriolis
        enabled ( :ref:`coriolis` ).

        Because orbit data is written in the database, a :ref:`set` command must be issued after the
        :ref:`prorb` command to ensure proper output for subsequent postprocessing commands.

        The coordinate system for displaying nodal results must be global Cartesian ( :ref:`rsys`, ``KCN`` =
        0). :ref:`prorb` is not supported if nodes are rotated in a cylindrical coordinate system.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PRRFOR_notes:

        :ref:`prrfor` has the same functionality as the :ref:`prrsol` command; use :ref:`prrfor` instead of
        :ref:`prrsol` when a :ref:`force` command has been issued.

        In a non-spectrum analysis, if either contact or pretension elements exist in the model,
        :ref:`prrfor` uses the :ref:`prrsol` command internally and the :ref:`force` setting is ignored.

        Because modal displacements cannot be used to calculate contact element nodal forces, those forces
        are not included in the spectrum and PSD analyses reaction solution. As a consequence, the
        :ref:`prrfor` command is not supported when constraints on contact element pilot nodes are present.

        :ref:`prrfor` is not valid when using the amplitude or phase results set ( ``KIMG`` = AMPL or PHAS
        on the :ref:`set` command). Use :ref:`prrsol` instead.

        **Using PRRFOR in a Spectrum or PSD Analysis ( ANTYPE,SPECTR)**
        When using :ref:`prrfor` in a spectrum analysis (after the combination file has been input through
        :ref:`input`,,MCOM and when :ref:`spopt` has not been issued with ``Elcalc`` = YES during the
        spectrum analysis), or in a PSD analysis when postprocessing 1-sigma results (loadstep 3, 4, or 5),
        the following message will display in the printout header:

        .. code:: apdl

           (Spectrum analysis summation is used)

        This message means that the summation of the element nodal forces is performed prior to the
        combination of those forces. In this case, :ref:`rsys` does not apply, and the reaction forces are
        in the nodal coordinate systems. Unlike :ref:`prrsol`, which retrieves the forces from the database,
        the :ref:`prrfor` command calculates the forces in the postprocessor.

        The spectrum analysis summation is available when the element results are written to the mode file,
        :file:`Jobname.mode` ( ``MSUPkey`` = Yes on :ref:`mxpand` ).

        The spectrum analysis summation is not available after reading a load case ( :ref:`lcwrite`,
        :ref:`lczero`, :ref:`lcase` ).

        :ref:`prrsol` provides the total reaction solution (static, plus damping, plus inertial, as
        appropriate based on the analysis type); however, modal reactions include only the static
        contribution.

        Use :ref:`prrfor` instead of :ref:`prrsol` with the :ref:`force` command to obtain only the static,
        damping, or inertial components.

        When using distributed-memory parallel processing, in a spectrum analysis or a PSD analysis
        performed with ``Elcalc`` = YES on the :ref:`spopt` command, use :ref:`prrfor` instead of
        :ref:`prrsol` to print the maximum reaction forces (spectrum analysis) or reaction forces variances
        of 1-σ solutions, as :ref:`prrsol` may lead to more conservative results.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item : str
            Predefined vector item (from :ref:`prvect_tab_1` below) or a label identifying the i-component
            of a user-defined vector.

        lab2 : str
            Label identifying the j-component of a user-defined vector. In most cases, this value must be
            blank if ``Item`` is selected from :ref:`prvect_tab_1`. Individual principal stresses ( ``Item``
            = S) or principal strains ( ``Item`` = EP ``xx`` ) may be printed by specifying the value as 1,
            2, or 3.

        lab3 : str
            Label identifying the k-component of a user-defined vector. Must be blank if ``Item`` is
            selected from list below or for 2D user defined vector.

        labp : str
            Label assigned to resultant vector for printout labeling (defaults to ``Item`` ).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PRVECT_notes:

        Prints various solution results as vector magnitude and direction cosines for the selected nodes
        and/or elements. For example, :ref:`prvect`,U prints the displacement magnitude and its direction
        cosines for all selected nodes. For nodal degree of freedom vector results, direction cosines are
        with respect to the results coordinate system RSYS. For element results, direction cosines are with
        respect to the global Cartesian system. Item components may be printed with the :ref:`prnsol`
        command. Various results also depend upon the recalculation method and the selected results location
        ( :ref:`layer`, :ref:`shell`, :ref:`nsel`, and :ref:`esel` ). Items may be selected from a set of
        recognized vector labels ( ``Item`` ) or a vector may be defined from up to three scalar labels (
        ``Item``, ``Lab2``, ``Lab3`` ). Scalar labels may be user-defined with the :ref:`etable` command.

        Portions of this command are not supported by PowerGraphics ( :ref:`graphics`,POWER).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SUMTYPE_notes:

        Issue :ref:`sumtype`,PRIN when you want to have a load case operation ( :ref:`lcoper` ) act on the
        principal / equivalent stresses instead of the component stresses. Also issue :ref:`sumtype`,PRIN
        when you want to read in load cases ( :ref:`lcase` ). Note that the :ref:`sumtype` setting is not
        maintained between /POS  T1 sessions.

        :ref:`sumtype`,PRIN also causes principal nodal values to be the average of the contributing
        principal element nodal values (see :ref:`avprin`,1).

        ``BEAM188`` and ``BEAM189`` elements compute principal stress, equivalent stress, and stress
        intensity values on request instead of storing them on the results file; :ref:`sumtype`,PRIN does
        not apply for these elements.
