        Notes
        -----

        .. _PRERR_notes:

        Prints the percent error in structural energy norm (SEPC) and the thermal energy norm percent error
        (TEPC). Approximations of mesh discretization error associated with a solution are calculated for
        analyses having structural or thermal degrees of freedom.

        The structural approximation is based on the energy error (which is similar in concept to the strain
        energy) and represents the error associated with the discrepancy between the calculated stress field
        and the globally continuous stress field (see `POST1 - Error Approximation Technique
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_post7.html#errormagbased>`_ in
        the `Mechanical APDL Theory Reference
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_thry/thy_biblio.html>`_). This
        discrepancy is due to the assumption in the elements that only the
        displacements are continuous at the nodes. The stress field is calculated from the displacements and
        should also be continuous, but generally is not.

        Thermal analyses may use any solid and shell thermal element having only temperature degrees of
        freedom. The thermal approximation is based on the total heat flow dissipation and represents the
        error associated with the discrepancy between the calculated nodal thermal flux within an element
        and a continuous global thermal flux. This continuous thermal flux is calculated with the normal
        nodal averaging procedure.

        The volume (result label VOLU) is used to calculate the energy error per element (result label SERR
        for the structural energy error and TERR for the thermal energy error). These energy errors, along
        with the appropriate energy, are then used to calculate the percent error in energy norm (SEPC for
        structural and TEPC for thermal). These percentages can be listed by the :ref:`prerr` command,
        retrieved by the :ref:`get` command (with labels SEPC and TEPC) for further calculations, and shown
        on the displacement display ( :ref:`pldisp` ), as applicable.

        For structural analyses, the maximum absolute value of nodal stress variation of any stress
        component for any node of an element (result item SDSG) is also calculated. Similarly, for thermal
        gradient components, TDSG is calculated. Minimum and maximum result bounds considering the possible
        effect of discretization error will be shown on contour displays ( :ref:`plnsol` ). For shell
        elements, the top surface location is used to produce a meaningful percentage value. SERR, TERR,
        SEPC, TEPC, SDSG, and TDSG will be updated whenever the nodal stresses or fluxes are recalculated.

        If the energy error is a significant portion of the total energy, then the analysis should be
        repeated using a finer mesh to obtain a more accurate solution. The energy error is relative from
        problem to problem but will converge to a zero energy error as the mesh is refined.

        **The following element- and material-type limitations apply:**

        * Valid with most 2D solid, 3D solid, axisymmetric solid, or 3D shell elements.

        * The model should have only structural or thermal degrees of freedom.

        * The analysis must be linear (for both material and geometry).

        * Multi-material (for example, composite) elements are not valid.

        * Transition regions from one material to another are not valid (that is, the entire model should
          consist of one material).

        * Anisotropic materials ( :ref:`tb`,ANEL) are not considered.
