        Mechanical APDL Command: `PLTRAC <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_PLTRAC.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        analopt : str
            Analysis option

            * ``ELEC`` - Particle trace in electric field

            * ``MAGN`` - Particle trace in magnetic field

            * ``EMAG`` - Particle trace in presence of both electric and magnetic fields (default)

        item : str
            Label identifying the item to be contoured. Valid item labels are shown in :ref:`pltrac_tab_1`
            below. Some items also require a component label. If ``Item`` is blank, display only the path
            trajectory.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in :ref:`pltrac_tab_1`
            below.

        trpnum : str
            Trace point number for storing trajectory data for use with :ref:`path` logic. Defaults to 0 (no
            trajectory path data is stored for further processing with :ref:`path` logic).

        name : str
            Name of prefix of array variable. Defaults to TRAC. ``Name`` POIN stores trajectory path points
            for trace point number ``TRPNum``. If ``Analopt`` = ELEC, MAGN, or EMAG, two additional array
            parameters, ``Name`` DATA and ``Name`` LABL, store trajectory path data and labels for the same
            ``TRPNum``.

        mxloop : str
            Maximum number of loops traced by a particle. Defaults to 1000.

        toler : str
            Length tolerance used for particle trajectory geometry calculation. Valid for ``Analopt`` =
            ELEC, MAGN, or EMAG. If particle trace appears to terminate inside an element, adjusting the
            length tolerance may be necessary. Defaults to 1.0 x 10 :sup:`-8`.

        escl : str
            Electric field scale factor. Setting this scale factor affects only the tracing, not the field
            solution results. A negative factor corresponds to the opposite vector direction. Valid only for
            ``Analopt`` = ELEC or EMAG. Defaults to 1.

        mscl : str
            Magnetic field scale factor. Setting this scale factor affects only the tracing, not the field
            solution results. A negative factor corresponds to the opposite vector direction. Valid only for
            ``Analopt`` = MAGN or EMAG. Defaults to 1.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _PLTRAC_notes:

        For a specified item, the variation of the item is displayed along the particle trace as a color-
        contoured ribbon. The :ref:`trpoin` command must be used to define a point on the trajectory path.
        Multiple traces may be displayed simultaneously by defining multiple trace points. Issue the
        :ref:`trplis` command to list the current tracing points. Issue the :ref:`trpdel` command to delete
        tracing points defined earlier. Use the :ref:`paput` command with the POIN option to retrieve the
        particle trajectory points as path points.

        The model must be 3D for the ELEC, MAGN, and EMAG analysis options.

        Three array parameters are created at the time of the particle trace: TRACPOIN, TRACDATA and
        TRACLABL. These array parameters can be used to put the particle velocity and the elapsed time into
        path form. The procedure to put the arrays into a path named PATHNAME is as follows:

        .. code:: apdl

           *get,npts,PARM,TRACPOIN,DIM,x
           PATH,PATHNAME,npts,9,1
           PAPUT,TRACPOIN,POINTS
           PAPUT,TRACDATA,TABLES
           PAPUT,TRACLABL,LABELS
           PRPATH,S,T_TRACE,VX_TRACE,VY_TRACE,VZ_TRACE,VS_TRACE

        If working in the GUI, use the "All information" option to retrieve information from all three
        arrays at once.
