        Parameters

            Reference number for this event (within ``MXEV`` ).

        cycle : str

        Parameters
        ----------
        nloc : str
            Reference number for this location (within ``MXLOC`` ). When defining a new location, defaults
            to lowest unused location. If the specified ``NODE`` is already associated with a location,
            ``NLOC`` defaults to that existing location.

        node : str
            Node number corresponding to this location (must be unique). Used only to associate a node with
            a new location or to find an existing location (if ``NLOC`` is not input). If ``NODE`` = -1 (or
            redefined), erase all parameters and fatigue stresses for this location.

        scfx : str
            Stress concentration factors applied to the total stresses. Factors are applied in the global X,
            Y, and Z directions unless the axisymmetric option of the :ref:`fssect` is used (that is,
            ``RHO`` is nonzero), in which case the factors are applied in the section x, y, and z (radial,
            axial, and hoop) directions.

        scfy : str
            Stress concentration factors applied to the total stresses. Factors are applied in the global X,
            Y, and Z directions unless the axisymmetric option of the :ref:`fssect` is used (that is,

            axial, and hoop) directions.

        title : str
            User-defined title for this location (up to 20 characters).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _FL_notes:

        Repeat FL command to define additional sets of location parameters ( ``MXLOC`` limit), to redefine
        location parameters, or to delete location stress conditions.

        One location must be defined for each node of interest and only one node can be associated with each
        location. See the FTSIZE command for the maximum locations ( ``MXLOC`` ) allowed. A location will be
        automatically defined for a node not having a location when the FSSECT, FSNODE, or FS command is

        stress concentration factors, and no title.

        stored according to the event number and loading number specified. The location is associated with
        that previously defined for this node (FL) or else it is automatically defined. Stresses are stored
        as six total components (SX through SYZ). Temperature and current time are also stored along with
        the total stress components. Calculations are made from the stresses currently in the database (last
        :ref:`set` or :ref:`lcase` command). Stresses stored are in global Cartesian coordinates, regardless
        of the active results coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys` ).

        You can issue the FSLIST command to list stresses, and the FS command to modify stored stresses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nloc : str
            Display stresses associated with location ``NLOC``.

        item : int or str
            Display stresses associated with item number ``ITEM``. Items are as follows:

            * ``1-6`` - SX, SY, SZ, SXY, SYZ, SXZ total stress components

            * ``7`` - Temperature

            * ``8-13`` - SX, SY, SZ, SXY, SYZ, SXZ membrane-plus-bending stress components.

            * ``14`` - Time
