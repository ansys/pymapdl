        Parameters
        ----------
        surfname
            Eight character surface name.

        surftype
            Surface type.

            CPLANE - Surface is defined by the cutting plane in window one (controlled by the
                     working plane (/CPLANE,1), NOT the view settings
                     (/CPLANE,0)).

            SPHERE - Surface is defined by a spherical surface centered about the working plane
                     origin.

            INFC - Surface is defined by a cylindrical surface centered about the working plane
                   origin and extending indefinitely in the positive and
                   negative Z directions.

        nrefine
            Refinement level.

            For SurfType = CPLANE -  The refinement level of the surface "mesh". This will be an integer between 0
                              and 3 (default = 0). See Notes below.

            For SurfType = SPHERE - The number of divisions along a 90° arc (minimum = 9). The default is 9.

            For SurfType = INFC - The number of divisions along a 90° arc (minimum = 9). The default is 9.

        radius
            Appropriate radius value (for INFC or SPHERE).

        tolout
            Tolerance value for inclusion of element facets within a prescribed
            volume. (for INFC)

        Notes
        -----
        This command creates a new surface and stores the following data for
        that surface:

        For SurfType = CPLANE, nRefine refers to the number of points that
        define the surface. An nRefine value of zero is used for points where
        the element face intersects the cutting plane.

        If SurfType = CPLANE and nRefine = 0, the points reside at the section
        cuts where the element intersects the cutting plane. Increasing nRefine
        from 0 to 1 will subdivide each surface facet into 4 subfacets, and
        increase the number of points at which results can be interpolated.

        For SurfType = CPLANE , the setting from the /EFACET command will
        affect the creation of surface facets and the quality of the fit of the
        surface in the model.  SUCR employs geometry data from PowerGraphics to
        aid in determining where the surface intersects the model.  If
        /EFACET,1 is in effect when the SUCR command is issued, then the
        curvature of high order elements (that is, elements with midside nodes)
        will be ignored.  If your model contains high order elements, you can
        see a better fit for your surface if /EFACET,2 is in effect when the
        SUCR command is issued.  Currently, the SUCR command interprets
        /EFACET,4 to mean /EFACET,2.

        For SurfType = INFC, a default tolerance of 0.01 will be applied to
        include the vertices of any facets that fall out of the cylinder
        definition. This tolerance increases the facet size by one percent to
        check for inclusion. Excluding facets under such a small tolerance may
        yield unacceptable (aesthetically) results. Increasing the tolerance by
        a larger amount (0.1 or 10%) will sometimes yield smother edges along
        the surface you create.
