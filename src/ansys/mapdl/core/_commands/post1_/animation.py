        rsltdat
            The type of results data to be used for the animation sequence.
            This can be:

            0 - Current load step data (default).

            1 - Range of load step data.

            2 - Range of results data.

        min\_

            data point.

        max\_
            The range maximum value.  If left blank or 0, defaults to the last

        incr
            The increment between result data (defaults to 1).

            Key to force the last sub step in a selected load step to be
            included in the animation (defaults to 0).

        autocont
            A value of 1 enables automatic scaling of contour values based on

        APDL Command: ANCYC
        symmetry analysis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        numframes
            The number of plot frames for the animation. Valid values range
            from 5 through 36. The default is 18. A low value (because it
            specifies fewer graphical frames) produces a rougher animation but
            loads faster. A high value produces a smoother animation but
            requires more time to load.

        kcycl
            The animation mode:

            0 - Continuous animation cycle (forward-reverse-forward).

            1 - Discontinuous animation cycle (forward-reset-forward). This option is the
                default.

        delay
            The time delay (in seconds) between animation frames. Valid values
            range from 0.1 through 1.0. The default is 0.1 seconds, which
            produces a seemingly real-time animation. A higher value produces a
            slower animation.

        Notes
        -----
        The ANCYC command is valid in a modal cyclic symmetry analysis only.

        The command animates the cyclic symmetry mode shape plot in the General
        Post Processor (/POST1). When you issue a nodal- or element-results
        plot command (for example, PLNSOL, PLESOL, or PLDISP) and then issue
        the ANCYC command, ANSYS applies a traveling wave animation to the mode
        shape plot.

        Each frame of the animation is created by expanding the cyclic symmetry
        mode shape at increasing phase angles (via the /CYCEXPAND command)
        starting at zero in equal increments over 360Â°. The phase-angle
        increment is 360 / NUMFRAMES.

        The animation display shows the traveling wave of the result quantity
        being plotted. The traveling wave animation is applicable only to nodal
        diameters (harmonic indices) greater than 0 and less than N / 2 (where
        N is the number of cyclic sectors in the model).

        For more information, see Applying a Traveling Wave Animation to the
        Cyclic Model in the Cyclic Symmetry Analysis Guide.

        ANHARM invokes an ANSYS macro which produces an animated sequence of:

        Time-harmonic results in the case of a harmonic analysis
        (ANTYPE,HARMIC)

        Complex mode shapes in the case of a modal analysis (ANTYPE,MODAL).

        In both cases, the results are those of the last plot action (for
        example, PLNSOL,B,SUM).

        The animation converts the complex solution variables (real and
        imaginary sets) into time varying results over one period. For example,
        if NFRAM = 12, then the frame captures are in increments of 30 degree
        phase angles.

        A second set of NFRAM frames will be generated for damped eigenmodes
        from complex eigensolvers to visualize any exponential decay or growth
        of the oscillations. The second set generated will display frames from
        the period number specified by NPERIOD.

        In a CMS analysis, the ANHARM command can be used after the CMS
        expansion pass or the use pass. To use ANHARM after the expansion pass,
        you must indicate whether a modal analysis or a harmonic analysis was
        performed in the CMS use pass by setting CMS_ANTYPE to either MODAL or
        HARMIC. If the use pass was a modal analysis, you must also set the
        CMS_MODOPT field to indicate the mode extraction method that was used
        (UNSYM, DAMP, or QRDAMP). If CMS_MODOPT = QRDAMP, it is assumed that
        CPXMOD was set to ON in the MODOPT command to request complex
        eigenmodes. If the ANHARM command is used after the use pass, it is not
        necessary to set the CMS_ANTYPE or CMS_MODOPT arguments.

        ext

            'rs' - Animate Jobname.rsnn. Default = 'rs'.

        Notes
        -----
        ANMRES invokes an ANSYS macro that performs animation across multiple
        results files (Jobname.EXT, Jobname.EXT, etc.) produced by an explicit
        dynamic structural analysis or fluid flow analysis with remeshing.
        Multiple results files typically occur when adaptive meshing is used in
        an explicit dynamic structural analysis or fluid flow analysis with
        remeshing. Each results file must have more than one set of results.
        ANMRES cannot be used for multiple results files that are caused by
        file splitting.

        ANMRES animates results from files having the currently specified
        jobname (Jobname.EXT - Jobname.EXT).  To change the current jobname,
        use  the /FILNAME command. The animation is based on the last plot
        command (e.g., PLDISP).

        Parameters

        nfram
            Number of frame captures (defaults to 5).

        delay
            Time delay during animation (defaults to 0.1 seconds).

        rsltdat
            The results data to be used for the animation sequence.  This can
            be:

            0 - Current load step data (default).

        min\_

        max\_

        The ANTIME command operates only on graphic display platforms
        supporting the /SEG command. It uses an ANSYS macro to produce an
        animation of contour values for the last plot action command (for
        example, PLDISP).  After executing ANTIME, the ANIM command will replay
        the animated sequence.

        APDL Command: TRTIME
        particle trace) command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time
            Total Trace Time (seconds) (defaults to 0, which is the full flow
            trace).

        spacing
            Particle spacing in seconds (defaults to 0).

        offset
            Particle offset in seconds (defaults to 0).  It is used internally
            in the ANFLOW macro to produce an animation of particle flow in a
            flowing fluid or charged particle motion in an electric or magnetic
            field.

        size
            Particle size (defaults to 0, which is a line).

        length
            Particle length fraction (defaults to .1).

        Notes
        -----
        The TRTIME command varies the type of   PLTRAC display produced.
        Particle flow or charged particle traces follow a particle's path in
        the forward and backward direction of travel. The DOF selected
        determines the color of the particle trace.  SPACING defines the
        particle spacing in seconds from adjacent particles in the stream line.
        OFFSET defines the offset in seconds from the spacing set by the
        SPACING argument.

        LENGTH defines the particle length fraction.  The default value (.1),
        means the particle occupies 10% of the flow region, and the other 90%
        is a color-coded line.

        SIZE sets the radius of the particle. Use SPACING, OFFSET and LENGTH
        only when SIZE is nonzero (i.e., the particle is bigger than the line).
