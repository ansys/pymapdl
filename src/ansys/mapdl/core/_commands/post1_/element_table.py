            Element for which results are to be modified.  If ALL, modify all

        lab
            Label identifying results.  Valid labels are as defined with the
            ETABLE command.  Issue ETABLE,STAT to display labels and values.

        v1
            Value assigned to this element table result in the database.  If
            zero, a zero value will be assigned.  If blank, value remains
            unchanged.

        v2, v3, v4, . . . , v6
            Additional values (if any) assigned to consecutive element table
            columns.

        Modifies element table [ETABLE] results in the database.  For example,

        three table columns starting with label ABC for element 35.  Use the
        PRETAB command to list the current results.  After deleting a column of
        data using ETABLE,Lab,ERASE, the remaining columns of data are not
        shifted to compress the empty slot.  Therefore, the user must allocate
        null (blank) values for V1, V2...V6 for any ETABLE entries which have
        been deleted by issuing ETABLE,Lab,ERASE.  All data are stored in the

        APDL Command: ETABLE

        The ETABLE command defines a table of values per element (the
        element table) for use in further processing. The element
        table is organized similar to spreadsheet, with rows
        representing all selected elements and columns consisting of
        result items which have been moved into the table (Item,Comp)
        via ETABLE. Each column of data is identified by a
        user-defined label (Lab) for listings and displays.

        After entering the data into the element table, you are not
        limited to merely listing or displaying your data (PLESOL,
        PRESOL, etc.). You may also perform many types of operations
        on your data, such as adding or multiplying columns (SADD,
        SMULT), defining allowable stresses for safety calculations
        (SALLOW), or multiplying one column by another (SMULT).  See
        Getting Started in the Basic Analysis Guide for more
        information.

        Various results data can be stored in the element table. For
        example, many items for an element are inherently
        single-valued (one value per element). The single-valued items
        include: SERR, SDSG, TERR, TDSG, SENE, SEDN, TENE, KENE, AENE,
        JHEAT, JS, VOLU, and CENT. All other items are multivalued
        (varying over the element, such that there is a different
        value at each node). Because only one value is stored in the
        element table per element, an average value (based on the
        number of contributing nodes) is calculated for multivalued
        items. Exceptions to this averaging procedure are FMAG and all
        element force items, which represent the sum only of the
        contributing nodal values.

        Two methods of data access can be used with the ETABLE
        command. The method you select depends upon the type of data
        that you want to store.  Some results can be accessed via a
        generic label (Component Name method), while others require a
        label and number (Sequence Number method).

        The Component Name method is used to access the General
        element data (that is, element data which is generally
        available to most element types or groups of element
        types). All of the single-valued items and some of the more
        general multivalued items are accessible with the Component
        Name method.  Various element results depend on the
        calculation method and the selected results location (AVPRIN,
        RSYS, LAYER, SHELL, and ESEL).

        Although nodal data is readily available for listings and
        displays (PRNSOL, PLNSOL) without using the element table, you
        may also use the Component Name method to enter these results
        into the element table for further "worksheet"
        manipulation. (See Getting Started in theBasic Analysis Guide
        for more information.) A listing of the General Item and Comp
        labels for the Component Name method is shown below.

        The Sequence Number method allows you to view results for data
        that is not averaged (such as pressures at nodes, temperatures
        at integration points, etc.), or data that is not easily
        described in a generic fashion (such as all derived data for
        structural line elements and contact elements, all derived
        data for thermal line elements, layer data for layered
        elements, etc.). A table illustrating the Items (such as LS,
        LEPEL, LEPTH, SMISC, NMISC, SURF, etc.) and corresponding
        sequence numbers for each element is shown in the Output Data
        section of each element description found in the Element
        Reference.

        Some element table data are reported in the results coordinate
        system.  These include all component results (for example, UX,
        UY, etc.; SX, SY, etc.). The solution writes component results
        in the database and on the results file in the solution
        coordinate system. When you issue the ETABLE command, these
        results are then transformed into the results coordinate
        system (RSYS) before being stored in the element table. The
        default results coordinate system is global Cartesian
        (RSYS,0).  All other data are retrieved from the database and
        stored in the element table with no coordinate transformation.

        Use the PRETAB, PLETAB, or ETABLE,STAT commands to display the
        stored table values. Issue ETABLE,ERAS to erase the entire
        table. Issue ETABLE,Lab,ERAS to erase a Lab column.

        The element table data option (Option) is not available for
        all output items.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Any unique user defined label for use in subsequent
            commands and output headings (maximum of eight characters
            and not a General predefined Item label). Defaults to an
            eight character label formed by concatenating the first
            four characters of the Item and Comp labels. If the same
            as a previous user label, this result item will be
            included under the same label. Up to 200 different labels
            may be defined. The following labels are predefined and
            are not available for user-defined labels: ``'REFL''`,
            ``'STAT'``, and ``'ERAS'``.  ``lab='REFL'`` refills all
            tables previously defined with the :meth:`etable` commands
            (not the CALC module commands) according to the latest
            ETABLE specifications and is convenient for refilling
            tables after the load step (SET) has been
            changed. Remaining fields will be ignored if
            ``Lab='REFL'``.  ``lab='STAT'`` displays stored table
            values.  ``lab='ERAS'`` erases the entire table.

        item
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown
            in the table below. Some items also require a component
            label. Character parameters may be used. ``item='eras'``
            erases a Lab column.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required). General component
            labels are shown in the table below. Character parameters
            may be used.

        option
            Option for storing element table data:

            * ``'MIN'`` - Store minimum element nodal value of the specified
              item component.
            * ``'MAX'`` - Store maximum element nodal value of the specified
              item component.
            * ``'AVG'`` - Store averaged element centroid value of the
              specified item component (default).

        display lines (lines of constant value) are determined by linear
        interpolation within each element from the nodal values.  These nodal
        values have the option of being averaged (values are averaged at a node
        whenever two or more elements connect to the same node) or not averaged
        (discontinuous).  The discontinuity between contour lines of adjacent
