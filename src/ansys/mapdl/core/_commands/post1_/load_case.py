        oper
            Valid operations are:

            SQUA - Square database values (LCASE1 ignored).

            SQRT - Square root of database (absolute) values (LCASE1 ignored).

                    shown for the NMISC items of the ETABLE command for the
                    specific line element type.

            ADD - Add LCASE1 to database values.

            SUB - Subtract LCASE1 from database values.

            SRSS - Square root of the sum of the squares of database and LCASE1.

            MIN - Compare and save in database the algebraic minimum of database and LCASE1.

            MAX - Compare and save in database the algebraic maximum of database and LCASE1.

            ABMN - Compare and save in database the absolute minimum of database and LCASE1 (based
                   on magnitudes, then apply the corresponding sign).

            ABMX - Compare and save in database the absolute maximum of database and LCASE1 (based
                   on magnitudes, then apply the corresponding sign).

        lcase1
            First load case in the operation (if any).  See LCNO of the LCDEF
            command. If ALL, repeat operations using all selected load cases
            [LCSEL].

        oper2
            Valid operations are:

            MULT - Multiplication: ``LCASE1*LCASE2``

            CPXMAX - This option does a phase angle sweep to calculate the maximum of derived
                     stresses and equivalent strain for a complex solution
                     where LCASE1 is the real part and LCASE2 is the imaginary
                     part. The Oper field is not applicable with  this option.
                     Also, the LCABS and SUMTYPE commands have no effect on
                     this option. The value of S3 will be a minimum.   This
                     option does not apply to derived displacement amplitude

                     Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for more information.

        lcase2
            Second load case.  Used only with Oper2 operations.

        Notes
        -----
        LCOPER operates on the database and one or two load cases according to:

        Database = Database Oper (LCASE1 Oper2 LCASE2)

        where operations Oper and Oper2 are as described above.  Absolute
        values and scale factors may be applied to the load cases before the
        operations [LCABS, LCFACT].  If LCASE1 is not specified, only operation
        Oper is performed on the current database.  If LCASE2 is specified,
        operation Oper2 will be performed before operation Oper.  If LCASE2 is
        not specified, operation Oper2 is ignored.  Solution items not
        contained [OUTRES] in either the database or the applicable load cases
        will result in a null item during a load case operation.  Harmonic
        element data read from a result file load case are processed at zero
        degrees.  All load case combinations are performed in the solution
        coordinate system, and the data resulting from load case combinations
        are stored in the solution coordinate system.  The resultant data are
        then transformed to the active results coordinate system [RSYS] when
        listed or displayed. Except in the cases of Oper = LPRIN, ADD, or SUB,
        you must use RSYS,SOLU to list or display, and in the case of layered
        elements, the layer (LAYER) must also be specified.

        Use the FORCE command prior to any combination operation to correctly
        combine the requested force type.

        If Oper2=CPXMAX, the derived stresses and strain calculation do not
        apply to line elements.
