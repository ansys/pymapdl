        Notes
        -----
        Defines and interpolates a labeled path item along a predefined path
        (PATH).  Path item results are in the global Cartesian coordinate
        directions unless transformed (RSYS).  A path item must be defined
        before it can be used with other path operations.  Additional path
        items may be defined from the PVECT, PCALC, PDOT, and PCROSS commands.
        Path items may be listed (PRPATH) or displayed (PLPATH, PLPAGM).  A
        maximum number of path items permitted is established by the nSets
        argument specified with the PATH command.

        When you create the first path item (PDEF or PVECT), the program
        automatically interpolates four path items which are used to describe
        the geometry of the path.  These predefined items are the position of
        the interpolated path points (labels XG, YG, and ZG) in global
        Cartesian coordinates, and the path length (label S).  For alternate
        methods of mapping the path geometry (to include, for example, material
        discontinuity) see the PMAP command.  These items may also be listed or
        displayed with the PRPATH, PLPATH, and PLPAGM commands.

        If specifying that load case operations act on principal/equivalent
        stresses (SUMTYPE,PRIN), derived quantities (principal and equivalent
        stresses/strains) will be zero for path plots. A typical use for such a
        case involves mode combinations in a response spectrum analysis.

        The number of interpolation points on the path is defined by the nDiv
        argument on the PATH command.  See Mapping Nodal and Element Data onto
        the Path in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for details.  Use
        PDEF,STAT to list the path item labels.  Use PDEF,CLEAR to erase all
        labeled path items, except the path geometry items (XG, YG, ZG, S).

        For SHELL131 and SHELL132 elements with KEYOPT(3) = 0 or 1, use the
        labels TBOT, TE2, TE3, ..., TTOP instead of TEMP.

        For more information on the meaning of contact status and its possible
        values, see Reviewing Results in POST1 in the Contact Technology Guide.

            Through-thickness bending stresses key for an axisymmetric analysis
            (RHO ≠ 0):

            0 - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses.

        Calculates and displays the membrane and membrane-plus-bending
        linearized stresses (as described for the PRSECT command) along a path
        section [PATH] as a graph.  The path section is defined by two points
        specified with the PPATH command. For linearized stress calculations,
        the path must be defined with nodes. The path must be entirely within
        the selected elements (that is, there must not be any element gaps
        along the path). The total stress (equivalent to the PLPATH display) is
        also displayed.  This command always uses 48 divisions along the path,
        regardless of the number of divisions defined by PATH.

                       This gives you accurate derivatives, integrals,
                       tangents, and normals for curves which do not have

                       command must be greater than 2.

        discon
            Sets mapping for discontinuities in the field.  The divisions are
            modified to put a point just before and just after the
            discontinuity.  The valid label is MAT, for a material
            discontinuity.  No discontinuity is the default.  Discontinuity
            mapping involves the NOAV option on the PDEF command.

        Notes
        -----
        You may choose to linearize the stresses through a section and separate
        them into categories for various code calculations.  PRSECT calculates
        and reports linearized stresses along a section path.  The linearized
        stresses are also separated into membrane, bending, membrane plus
        bending, peak, and total stress categories.

        First, define your section path using the PATH and PPATH (with the NODE
        option) commands.  Your path must lie entirely within the selected set
        of elements (that is, there must be no element gaps along the path).
        PATH and PPATH are used only to retrieve the two end nodes.  The path
        data is not retained.  The section path is defined by the two end
        nodes, and by 47 intermediate points that are automatically determined
        by linear interpolation in the active display coordinate system [DSYS].
        The number and location of the intermediate points are not affected by
        the number of divisions set by PATH,,,,nDiv.

        Your  linearized component stress values are obtained by interpolating
        each element’s  average corner nodal values along the section path
        points within each path element.  PRSECT reports the linearized
        component and principal stresses for each stress category at the
        beginning, mid-length, and end of the section path.  PRPATH can be used
        to report the total stresses at the intermediate points.

        Section paths may be through any set of solid (2-D plane, 2-D
        axisymmetric or 3-D) elements.  However, section paths are usually
        defined to be through the thickness of the structure and normal to the
        inner and outer structure surfaces.  Section paths (in-plane only) may
        also be defined for shell element structures.  See the Mechanical APDL
        Theory Reference for details.

        If the RHO option is set to indicate the axisymmetric option (non-
        zero), PRSECT reports the linearized stresses in the section
        coordinates (SX – along the path, SY – normal to the path, and SZ –
        hoop direction).  If the RHO option is set to indicate the 2-D planar
        or 3-D option (zero or blank), PRSECT reports the linearized stresses
        in the active results coordinate system [RSYS].  If the RHO option is
        zero or blank and either RSYS, SOLU or RSYS, -1 are active, the
        linearized stresses are calculated and reported in the global Cartesian
        coordinate system.  It is recommended that linearized stress
        calculations be performed in a rectangular coordinate system.
        Principal stresses are recalculated from the component stresses and are
        invariant with the coordinate system as long as SX is in the same
        direction at all points along the defined path.  The PLSECT command
        displays the linearized stresses in the same coordinate system as
        reported by PRSECT.

        Stress components through the section are linearized by a line integral
        method and separated into constant membrane stresses, bending stresses
        varying linearly between end points, and peak stresses (defined as the
        difference between the actual (total) stress and the membrane plus
        bending combination).

        For nonaxisymmetric structures,  the bending stresses are calculated
        such that the neutral axis is at the midpoint of the path.
        Axisymmetric results include the effects of both the radius of
        revolution (automatically determined from the node locations) and the
        in-plane average radius of curvature of the section surfaces (user
        input).

        For axisymmetric cases, Mechanical APDL calculates the linearized
        bending stress in the through-thickness direction as the difference
        between the total outer fiber stress and the membrane stress if KBR =
        1. The calculation method may be conservative for locations with a
        highly nonlinear variation of stress in the through-thickness
        direction.  Alternatively, you can specify KBR = 2 to calculate the
        bending stress using the same method and formula as the Y (axial
        direction) bending stress. For more information, see the discussion of
        axisymmetric cases (specifically Equation: 17–40) in the Mechanical
        APDL Theory Reference.
