        Parameters
        ----------
        node : str
            Node number at which an MDOF is defined. If ALL, define MDOFs at all selected nodes (
            :ref:`nsel` ). If ``NODE`` = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields
            are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may also be substituted for ``NODE``.

        lab1 : str
            Additional MDOF labels. The nodes defined are associated with each label specified.

        nend : str
            Define all nodes from ``NODE`` to ``NEND`` (defaults to ``NODE`` ) in steps of ``NINC``
            (defaults to 1) as MDOFs in the specified direction.

        ninc : str
            Define all nodes from ``NODE`` to ``NEND`` (defaults to ``NODE`` ) in steps of ``NINC``
            (defaults to 1) as MDOFs in the specified direction.

        lab2 : str
            Additional MDOF labels. The nodes defined are associated with each label specified.

        lab3 : str
            Additional MDOF labels. The nodes defined are associated with each label specified.

        lab4 : str
            Additional MDOF labels. The nodes defined are associated with each label specified.

        lab5 : str
            Additional MDOF labels. The nodes defined are associated with each label specified.

        lab6 : str
            Additional MDOF labels. The nodes defined are associated with each label specified.

        support : str
            Pseudo-constraints key for the free-interface ( :ref:`cmsopt`,FREE) and residual-flexible free-
            interface ( :ref:`cmsopt`, RFFB) CMS method analyses:

            OFF - Defined MDOFs remain free during the mode-extraction analysis (default).

            ON - Defined MDOFs are constrained during the mode-extraction analysis.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _M_notes:

        Defines master degrees of freedom (MDOFs) for superelement generation. If defined for other
        analyses, MDOFs are ignored. If used in the SOLUTION processor, this command is valid only within
        the first load step.

        Reissue :ref:`m` for additional MDOFs. The number of master nodes allowed is limited only by the
        maximum system memory available.

        The substructure ( :ref:`antype`,SUBSTR) analysis uses the matrix condensation technique to reduce
        the structure matrices to those characterized by a set of MDOFs.

        MDOFs are identified by a list of nodes and their nodal directions. The actual degree-of-freedom
        directions available for a given node depends upon the degrees of freedom associated with element
        types ( :ref:`et` ) at that node.

        There must be some mass (or stress stiffening in the case of a buckling analysis) associated with
        each MDOF (except for the VOLT label). The mass may be due either to the distributed mass of the
        element or due to discrete lumped masses at the node.

        If an MDOF is specified at a constrained point, it is ignored.

        If an MDOF is specified at a coupled node, it should be specified at the prime node of the coupled
        set.

        For cyclic symmetry superelements, if MDOFs are defined at both low- and high-edge nodes, the cyclic
        constraint equations between those nodes are ignored.

        Substructure analysis connection points must be defined as MDOFs.

        The ``SUPPORT`` argument is ignored for the fixed-interface CMS method analysis (
        :ref:`cmsopt`,FIX).

        This command is also valid in PREP7.
