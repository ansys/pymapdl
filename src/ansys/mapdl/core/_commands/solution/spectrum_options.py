        Defines a partially correlated excitation in terms of a sphere of influence relating excitation
        point geometry (in a PSD analysis). If the distance between any two excitation points is less than
        ``RMIN``, then the excitation is fully correlated. If the distance is greater than ``RMAX``, then
        the excitation is uncorrelated. If the distance lies between ``RMIN`` and ``RMAX``, then the

        Parameters
        ----------

            Input table number. When used with the :ref:`coval` or the :ref:`qdval` command, ``TBLNO1``

        Parameters
        ----------
        signif : str
            Combine only those modes whose significance level exceeds the ``SIGNIF`` threshold. For PSD
            response ( :ref:`spopt`,PSD), the significance level is defined as the modal covariance matrix
            term, divided by the maximum modal covariance matrix term. Any term whose significance level is
            less than ``SIGNIF`` is considered insignificant and is not contributed to the mode
            combinations. The higher the ``SIGNIF`` threshold, the fewer the number of terms used.
            ``SIGNIF`` defaults to 0.0001. If ``SIGNIF`` is specified as 0.0, it is taken as 0.0.

        comode : str
            First ``COMODE`` number of modes to be actually combined. ``COMODE`` must always be less than or
            equal to ``NMODE`` (input quantity ``NMODE`` on the :ref:`spopt` command). ``COMODE`` defaults
            to ``NMODE``. ``COMODE`` performs a second level of control for the first sequential ``COMODE``
            number of modes to be combined. It uses the significance level threshold indicated by ``SIGNIF``
            and operates only on the significant modes.

        forcetype : str
            Label identifying the forces to be combined:

            * ``STATIC`` - Combine the modal static forces (default).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _MMASS_notes:

        The missing mass calculation is valid only for single point excitation response spectrum analysis (
        :ref:`spopt`, SPRS) and for multiple point response spectrum analysis ( :ref:`spopt`, MPRS)
        performed with base excitation using acceleration response spectrum loading. Missing mass is
        supported in a spectrum analysis only when the preceding modal analysis is performed with the Block
        Lanczos, PCG Lanczos, Supernode, or Subspace eigensolver (Method =LANB, LANPCG, SNODE, or SUBSP on
        the :ref:`modopt` command).

        The velocity solution is not available ( ``Label`` = VELO on the combination command: :ref:`srss`,
        :ref:`cqc`...) when the missing mass calculation is activated.

        The missing mass calculation is not supported when the spectrum analysis is based on a linear
        perturbation modal analysis performed after a nonlinear base analysis.

        The missing mass is not supported when superelements are present.

        To take into account the contribution of the truncated modes, the residual vector ( :ref:`resvec` )
        can be used in place of the missing mass response. This is of particular interest if the velocity
        solution is requested or if a nonlinear prestress is included in the analysis (linear perturbation),
        or if a superelement is present, since the missing mass cannot be used in these cases.

        In a multiple point response spectrum analysis ( :ref:`spopt`,MPRS), the :ref:`mmass` command must
        precede the participation factor calculation command ( :ref:`pfact` ).

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

            * ``DISP`` - Displacement solution (default). Displacements, stresses, forces, etc., are available.

              available.

            * ``ACEL`` - Acceleration solution. Accelerations, "stress accelerations," "force accelerations,"
              etc., are available.

        td : str
            Time duration for earthquake or shock spectrum. ``TD`` defaults to 10.

        Parameters
        ----------
        spectype : str
            Spectrum type:

            * ``SPRS`` - Single point excitation response spectrum (default). See also :ref:`svtyp`.

            * ``PSD`` - Power spectral density.

        nmode : str
            Use the first ``NMODE`` modes from the modal analysis. Defaults to all extracted modes, as
            specified by the :ref:`modopt` and :ref:`bucopt` commands. ``NMODE`` cannot be larger than

            Element results calculation key:

            * ``NO`` - Do not calculate element results and reaction forces (default).

            * ``YES`` - Calculate element results and reaction forces, as well as the nodal degree of freedom
              solution.

        modereusekey : str
            Key for existing ``MODE`` file reuse when running multiple spectrum analyses:

            * ``NO`` - No spectrum analysis has been performed yet (default).

            * ``YES`` - This is not the first spectrum analysis. The ``MODE`` file will be reused and the
              necessary files will be cleaned up for the new spectrum analysis.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _SPOPT_notes:

        Valid only for a spectrum analysis ( :ref:`antype`,SPECTR). This operation must be preceded by a
        modal solution ( :ref:`antype`,MODAL) with the appropriate files available. Both the spectrum
        analysis and the preceding modal analysis must be performed under the same Mechanical APDL version
        number.

        If used in SOLUTION, this command is valid only within the first load step.

        Element results are calculated ( ``Elcalc`` = YES) only if the element modal results are available
        (written to the :file:`Jobname.mode` file with ``MSUPkey`` = YES on the :ref:`mxpand` command). For
        ``Sptype`` = SPRS, MPRS, and DDAM, if the element results calculation is activated ( ``Elcalc`` =
        YES) and element modal results are not available, it is deactivated automatically.

        For SPRS, DDAM or MPRS analyses, modal responses can be combined and stored directly in the
        :file:`Jobname.rst` file during spectrum solution according to the mode combination method command
        issued ( :ref:`srss`, :ref:`cqc`, etc.) for ``Elcalc`` = YES. This can save significant time
        compared to the method for ``Elcalc`` = NO, which requires generating the file of POST1 commands (
        :file:`Jobname.mcom` file) to be read in POST1 to do the mode combinations. For details and example
        usage, see `Spectrum Analysis

              available.

            * ``ACEL`` - Acceleration solution. Accelerations, "stress accelerations," "force accelerations,"
              etc., are available.

        abssumkey : str
            Absolute Sum combination key (for :ref:`spopt`,MPRS only):

            * ``NO`` - Do not use the Absolute Sum method (default).

            * ``YES`` - Combine the modes per excitation direction using the Absolute Sum method, then combine
              the resulting quantities using the square root of sum of squares method.

              When using Absolute Sum combination, the excitation direction must be specified using the :ref:`sed`
