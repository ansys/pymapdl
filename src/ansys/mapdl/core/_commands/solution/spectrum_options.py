        ----------
        af
            Direction-dependent acceleration coefficient for elastic or
            elastic-plastic analysis option (default = 0).

        aa, ab, ac, ad
            Coefficients for the DDAM acceleration spectrum equations. Default
            for these coefficients is zero.

        amin
            The minimum acceleration value in inch/sec2.  It defaults to 2316

        This command specifies acceleration coefficients to analyze shock
        resistance of shipboard equipment.  These coefficients are used to

        Design Analysis Method in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference.  The

        Analysis Method.  This command, along with the VDDAM and SED commands,
        is used with the spectrum (ANTYPE,SPECTR) analysis as a special purpose
        alternative to the SV, FREQ, and SVTYP commands.  The mass and length
        units of the model must be in pounds and inches, respectively.

        DDASPEC may alternatively be used to calculate spectrum coefficients.

                   performed with the sparse and PCG solvers. When one is
                   encountered, a warning is issued and the analysis
                   continues. A negative pivot value may be valid for some
                   nonlinear and multiphysics analyses (for example,
                   electromagnetic and thermal analyses); this key has no
                   effect in these cases.

            OFF - Pivot values are not checked. This key causes the
                  analysis to continue in spite of a negative or zero
                  pivot value.

        prntcntrl
            Provides print options. Print output with these options will be
            sent to the default output file, not to the files created by the
            nonlinear diagnostic tools (NLDIAG).

            ONCE - Print only the maximum and minimum pivot information on
                   the first call to the sparse solver (which is the
                   default solver). This is the default behavior.

            EVERY - Print the maximum and minimum pivot information at
                    every call to the sparse solver. This option is
                    provided for nonlinear analysis diagnostics.

        Notes
        -----
        This command is valid for all analyses. In a nonlinear analysis, a
        negative pivot may be valid. In some cases, rigid body motions in
        a nonlinear analysis will be trapped by error routines checking
        infinitely large displacements (DOF limit exceeded) or
        nonconvergence status. An under-constrained model may avoid the
        pivot check, but fail with a DOF limit exceeded error.

        Machine precision may affect whether a small pivot triggers an
        error or bypasses this checking logic. You may wish to review the
        ratio of the maximum to absolute minimum pivot values. For ratios
        exceeding 12 to 14 orders of magnitude, the accuracy of the
        computed solution may be degraded by the severe ill-conditioning
        of the assembled matrix.

        Note that negative pivots corresponding to Lagrange multiplier
        based mixed u-P elements are not checked or reported by this
        command.  Negative pivots arising from the u-P element formulation
        and related analyses can occur and lead to correct solutions.

        signif
            Combine only those modes whose significance level exceeds theSIGNIF

        -----
        In single-point response spectrum analysis (SPOPT,SPRS), the excitation
        direction without rocking (ROCK) is normalized to one so that the SEDX,
        SEDY, and SEDZ values do not scale the spectrum.  The excitation
        direction with rocking is not normalized. The SEDX, SEDY, and SEDZ
        values must be consistent with the OMX, OMY, and OMZ values on the ROCK
        command. The calculated direction then scales the spectrum. For more
        information, see Participation Factors and Mode Coefficients.

        In multi-point response spectrum analysis (SPOPT,MPRS) and power
        spectral density analysis (SPOPT,PSD), the excitation direction is
        normalized to one so that the SEDX, SEDY, and SEDZ values do not scale
        the spectrum.  The component name (Cname) is required. The constraints
        corresponding to the excitation direction are applied to the component
        nodes.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.
