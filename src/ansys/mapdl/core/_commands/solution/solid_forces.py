        r"""Defines force loads at keypoints.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `FK <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_FK.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        kpoi : str
            Keypoint at which force is to be specified. If ALL, apply to all selected keypoints (
            :ref:`ksel` ). If ``KPOI`` = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields
            are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may also be substituted for ``KPOI``.

        lab : str
            Valid force labels are:

            * **Structural labels** : FX, FY, or FZ (forces); MX, MY, or MZ (moments).
            * **Thermal labels** : HEAT, HBOT, HE2, HE3,..., HTOP (heat flow).
            * **Fluid label** : FLOW (fluid flow).
            * **Electric labels** : AMPS (current flow), CHRG (electric charge).
            * **Magnetic labels** : FLUX (magnetic flux); CSGZ (magnetic current segment).
            * **Diffusion label** : RATE (diffusion flow rate).

        value : str
            Force value or table name reference for specifying tabular boundary conditions. To specify a
            table, enclose the table name in percent signs (%), for example, :ref:`fk`, ``KPOI``, HEAT,%
            ``tabname%``). Use the :ref:`dim` command to define a table.

        value2 : str
            Second force value (if any). If the analysis type and the force allow a complex input, ``VALUE``
            (above) is the real component and ``VALUE2`` is the imaginary component.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _FK_notes:

        Forces may be transferred from keypoints to nodes with the :ref:`ftran` or :ref:`sbctran` commands.
        See the :ref:`f` command for a description of force loads.

        Tabular boundary conditions ( ``VALUE`` = ``%tabname%``) are available only for the following
        labels: Fluid (FLOW), Electric (AMPS), Structural force (FX, FY, FZ, MX, MY, MZ), and Thermal (HEAT,
        HBOT, HE2, HE3,..., HTOP).

        This command is also valid in PREP7.
