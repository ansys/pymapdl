        For an analysis involving a prestressed structure, the CAMPBELL command
        specifies whether or not to prepare the result file to support  a
        Campbell diagram analysis (PRCAMP or PLCAMP).

        To prestress a structure, the program performs a static solution before
        the linear perturbation modal solution.

        The CAMPBELL command requires that modal and static analyses be
        performed alternately. It works only when the number of static analyses
        is the same as the number of modal analyses. Any number of analyses can
        be performed, but the same number of each (static and modal) is
        expected. The modal solutions are appended in the results file
        (Jobname.RSTP).

        Notes
        -----
        See NSUBST for an alternative input.

        Use consistent values for DTIME and TIME (TIME). For example, using 0.9
        for DTIME and 1.0 for TIME results in one time step because 1.0 (TIME)
        is divisible by .9 (DTIME) at most once. If you intend to load in 10
        increments over a time span of 1.0, use 0.1 for DTIME and 1.0 for TIME.

        The program calculates the initial incremental time so that (EndingTime
        - StartingTime)/DTIME is an integer, which may affect the initial
        incremental time that you specify. For example, if the starting time is
        0, the ending time is 1, and the initial incremental time is 0.4, the

            0 - Loads are linearly interpolated (ramped) for each substep from the values of
                the previous load step to the values of this load step. This is
                the default value.

            1 - Loads are step changed (stepped) at the first substep of this load step to the
                values of this load step (i.e., the same values are used for
                all substeps).  Useful for rate-dependent behavior (e.g.,
                creep, viscoplasticity, etc.) or transient load steps only.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies whether loads applied to intermediate substeps within the
        load step are to be stepped or ramped. Used only if DTIME on the DELTIM
        command is less than the time span or, conversely, if NSBSTP on the
        NSUBST command is greater than one. Flags (FSI, MXWF, MVDI, etc.) are
        always stepped.

        Changing the ramping KEY (i.e., switching between ramped and stepped
        boundary conditions) between load steps is not recommended.

        For ramped loading (KBC,0), when a load is applied for the first time,
        it is interpolated from zero to the value of the current load step, and
        not from the initial condition or value of the degree of freedom from
        the previous load step.

        Spatially varying tabular loads or boundary conditions do not support
        direct ramping or stepping options and, instead, apply their full
        values according to the supplied tabular functions regardless of the
        KBC setting.

        For a static or harmonic cyclic symmetry analysis, any load that varies
        by sector (CYCOPT,LDSECT) is tabular and is applied as a step change,
        regardless of the KBC setting; however, any non-tabular loads in the
        same analysis are ramped or stepped according to the KBC setting.

        Irrespective of the KBC setting, loads are usually step-removed. See
        Stepping or Ramping Loads in the Basic Analysis Guide for more
        information.

        It is sometimes difficult to obtain successful convergence with stepped
        loading in a nonlinear transient problem. If divergence is encountered,
        determine if stepped loading was used by default, then determine if it
        is appropriate for the analysis.

        Notes
        -----
        MAGSOLV invokes an ANSYS macro which specifies magnetic solution
        options and initiates the solution.  The macro is applicable to any
        ANSYS magnetostatic analysis using the magnetic vector potential (MVP),
        reduced scalar potential (RSP), difference scalar potential (DSP),
        general scalar potential (GSP), or combined MVP-RSP formulation
        options.  Results are only stored for the final converged solution.
        (In POST1, issue ``*SET,LIST`` to identify the load step of solution
        results.)  The macro internally determines if a nonlinear analysis is
        required based on magnetic material properties.

        If you use the BIOT option and issue SAVE after solution or
        postprocessing, the Biot-Savart calculations are saved to the database,
        but will be overwritten upon normal exit from the program.  To save
        this data after issuing SAVE, use the /EXIT,NOSAVE command.  You can
        also issue the /EXIT,SOLU command to exit ANSYS and save all solution
        data, including the Biot-Savart calculations, in the database.
        Otherwise, when you issue RESUME, the Biot-Savart calculation will be
        lost (resulting in a zero solution).

        The MVP, MVP-RSP, and edge formulation options perform a two-load-step
        solution sequence.  The first load step ramps the applied loads over a
        prescribed number of substeps (NRAMP), and the second load step
        calculates the converged solution.  For linear problems, only a single
        load step solution is performed.  The ramped load step can be bypassed
        by setting NRAMP to -1.

        The RSP option solves in a single load step using the adaptive descent
        procedure.  The DSP option uses two load steps, and the GSP solution
        uses three load steps.

        The following analysis options and nonlinear options are controlled by

        Specifies a range of solutions to be expanded from analyses that use
        mode-superposition methods (ANTYPE,HARMIC or TRANS) or substructuring
        (ANTYPE,SUBSTR).

        For ANTYPE,TRANS, NUM, evenly spaced solutions are expanded between
        time BEGRNG and time ENDRNG.

        For ANTYPE,HARMIC, NUM, evenly spaced solutions are expanded between
        frequency BEGRNG and frequency ENDRNG.

        The first expansion in all cases is done at the first point beyond
        BEGRNG (that is, at BEGRNG + (ENDRNG - BEGRNG) / NUM)).

        The resulting results file will maintain the same load step, substep,
        and time (or frequency) values as the use pass.

        For a single expansion of a solution, or for multiple expansions when
        the solutions are not evenly spaced (such as in a mode-superposition
        harmonic analysis with the cluster option), ANSYS, Inc. recommends
        issuing one or more EXPSOL commands.

        The NUMEXP command is invalid in these cases:

        In a substructing analysis (ANTYPE,SUBST) when a factorized matrix file
        (the .LN22 file generated by the sparse solver) does not exist, causing
        ANSYS to employ the full-resolve method.

        If the full-resolve option is selected using the SEOPT command.

        In both situations, use the EXPSOL command to perform a single
        expansion for each solution desired.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Associates the boundary conditions at the end of the load step with a
        particular TIME value.

        TIME must be a positive, nonzero, monotonically increasing quantity
        that "tracks" the input history.  Units of time should be consistent
        with those used elsewhere (for properties, creep equations, etc.).

        Typically, for the first load step TIME defaults to 1. However, for the
        first load step of a mode-superposition transient analysis
        (ANTYPE,TRANS and TRNOPT,MSUP), the TIME command is ignored and a
        static solution is performed at TIME = 0.

        For a full transient analyses, the command's default behavior does not
        apply. You must specify a time for each load step and it must be
        greater than the time at the end of the prior load step.

        TIME does not apply to modal (ANTYPE,MODAL), harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC),

        Defines the reference temperature for the thermal strain calculations

        Input the strain via ALPX, ALPY, ALPZ (the secant or mean coefficient
        value), or CTEX, CTEY, CTEZ (the instantaneous coefficient value), or
        the thermal strain value (THSX, THSY, THSZ). T is the element
        temperature. If α is temperature-dependent, TREF should be in the range
        of temperatures you define using the MPTEMP command.

            Identifies an Nx1x1 array parameter containing the key times at

        Notes
        -----
        Time values in the array parameter must be in ascending order and must
        not exceed the time at the end of the load step as defined on the TIME
        command. The time increment between time points in the array list must
        be larger than the initial time step defined on the DELTIM or NSUBST
        command.  Time values must also fall between the beginning and ending
        time values of the load step.  For multiple load step problems, you
        must either change the parameter values to fall between the beginning
        and ending time values of the load step or reissue the command with a
        new array parameter.  To clear the array parameter specification, issue
        TSRES,ERASE.  Results can be output at the requested time points if the
        array or time values in the array are also specified in the OUTRES

        Parameters

        factor
            Scale factor for displacements being added to nodal coordinates.
            If FACTOR = 1.0, the full displacement value will be added to each
            node, 0.5, half the displacement value will be added, etc.  If

            Key for zeroing displacements in the database:

            OFF - Do not zero the displacements (default).

            ON - Zero the displacements.

        Notes
        -----
        The UPCOORD command uses displacements stored in the ANSYS database,
        and not those contained within the results file, Jobname.RST.  Nodal
        coordinates are updated each time the command is issued.  After
        updating, both the nodal displacements and rotations are set to zero if
        Key = ON.

        For structural solutions with an updated mesh, unless the coefficient
        matrix is otherwise reformed (e.g., a new analysis or NLGEOM,ON) it
        should first be reformed by issuing a KUSE,-1 command.

        UPCOORD should not be issued between load steps in structural analysis.

        For a multiphysics simulation where a CFD or electromagnetic field is
        being coupled to a structure undergoing large displacements, all (or a
        portion) of the surrounding field mesh may take part in the structural
        solution to "move" with the displacing structure.  You can use the
        UPCOORD command with a suitable FACTOR to update the coordinates of the
        nodes using the newly computed displacements.  The mesh will now
        conform with the displaced structure for subsequent field solutions.
        However, the mesh should always be restored to its original location by
        using an UPCOORD,FACTOR command before performing any subsequent
        structural solutions.  This is true for both repeated linear solutions,
        and for nonlinear restarts. (All saved displacements are relative to
        the original mesh location.)

        This command is not intended to replace either the large displacement
        or birth and death logic.

        Other user subroutines (such as user elements, user creep, etc.) have

        The routines are commented and should be listed after performing a
        custom installation from the distribution media for more details.  See
        also the Advanced Analysis Guide for a general description of user-
        programmable features.

        Users must have system permission, system access, and knowledge to
        write, compile, and link the appropriate subroutines into the program
        at the site where it is to be run.  All routines should be written in
        FORTRAN. (For more information on FORTRAN compilers please refer to
