        key : str
            Automatic time stepping key:

            * ``OFF`` - Do not use automatic time stepping.

            * ``ON`` - Use automatic time stepping (default).

            * ``AUTO`` - The program determines whether to use automatic time stepping (used by Workbench).

        Notes
        -----

        .. _AUTOTS_notes:

        Specifies whether to use automatic time stepping (or load stepping) over this load step. If ``Key``
        = ON, both time step prediction and time step bisection will be used.

        Bisection does not occur with :ref:`thopt`,QUASI since it uses only one equilibrium iteration per
        substep. To ensure bisection, use the iterative QUASI method ( :ref:`thopt`,QUASI,,,,,,1).

        You cannot use automatic time stepping ( :ref:`autots` ), line search ( :ref:`lnsrch` ), or the DOF
        solution predictor ( :ref:`pred` ) with the arc-length method ( :ref:`arclen`, :ref:`arctrm` ). If
        you activate the arc-length method after you set :ref:`autots`, :ref:`lnsrch`, or :ref:`pred`, a
        warning message appears. If you choose to proceed with the arc-length method, the program disables
        your automatic time stepping, line search, and DOF predictor settings, and the time step size is
        controlled by the arc-length method internally.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

              of a prestressed structure.

        Notes
        -----
        For an analysis involving a prestressed structure, the :ref:`campbell` command specifies whether or
        not to prepare the result file to support a `Campbell diagram
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_rot/Hlp_G_ROTCAMPDIAGS.html#rotgencamp2a>`_
        analysis ( :ref:`prcamp` or :ref:`plcamp` ).

        To prestress a structure, the program performs a static solution before the `linear perturbation
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/strlinpertother.html>`_ modal
        solution. For specific information about rotating structures, see `Considerations for Rotating
        Structures
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/strllinpertrotmach.html#str_rot_rotating>`_

        The :ref:`campbell` command requires that modal and static analyses be performed alternately. It
        works only when the number of static analyses is the same as the number of modal analyses. Any
        number of analyses can be performed, but the same number of each (static and modal) is expected. The
        modal solutions are appended in the results file ( :file:`Jobname.RSTP` ).

        For an example of :ref:`campbell` command usage, see in the `Rotordynamic Analysis Guide

        Parameters
        ----------
        dtime : str
            Time step size for this step. If automatic time stepping is used ( :ref:`autots` ), ``DTIME`` is
            the starting time substep.

            ``CONTA177`` ) are used, defaults to ``TIME`` or ``TIME`` /20 (where ``TIME`` is the time at the
            end of the load step as set on the :ref:`time` command), depending on the physics of the model.
            If none of these contact elements are used, defaults to ``TIME``.

        dtmin : str
            Minimum time step (if automatic time stepping is used). The program automatically determines the
            default based on the physics of the model.

        dtmax : str
            Maximum time step (if automatic time stepping is used). The program automatically determines the
            default based on the physics of the model.

        carry : str
            Time step carry over key:

            * ``OFF`` - Use ``DTIME`` as time step at start of each load step.

            * ``ON`` - Use final time step from previous load step as the starting time step (if automatic time
              stepping is used).

            The program automatically determines the default based on the physics of the model.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _DELTIM_notes:

        See :ref:`nsubst` for an alternative input.

        Use consistent values for ``DTIME`` and ``TIME`` ( :ref:`time` ). For example, using 0.9 for
        ``DTIME`` and 1.0 for ``TIME`` results in one time step because 1.0 ( ``TIME`` ) is divisible by.9
        ( ``DTIME`` ) at most once. If you intend to load in 10 increments over a time span of 1.0, use 0.1
        for ``DTIME`` and 1.0 for ``TIME``.

        The program calculates the initial incremental time so that ( ``EndingTime`` - ``StartingTime`` )/
        ``DTIME`` is an integer, which may affect the initial incremental time that you specify. For
        example, if the starting time is 0, the ending time is 1, and the initial incremental time is 0.4,
        the program rounds to the nearest integer and adjusts the time to 0.33333.

        For solution efficiency, specify values for all fields of this command.

        Changing the time step size upon restarting an analysis during a load step is not recommended. You
        should only change the time step size between load steps.

            * ``1`` - Loads are step changed (stepped) at the first substep of this load step to the values of
              this load step (that is, the same values are used for all substeps). Useful for rate-dependent
              behavior (for example, creep, viscoplasticity, etc.) or transient load steps only.

        omgsqrdkey : int or str
            Key for the interpolation of the rotational velocity loading (only supported when ``KEY`` = 0):

            * ``0`` - Rotational velocities are linearly interpolated. This is the default.

            * ``1`` - A quadratic interpolation is used for the rotational velocities ( :ref:`omega`,
              :ref:`cmomega`, and :ref:`cmrotate` ). All other loads are interpolated linearly.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _KBC_notes:

        Specifies whether loads applied to intermediate substeps within the load step are to be stepped or
        ramped. Used only if ``DTIME`` on the :ref:`deltim` command is less than the time span or,
        conversely, if ``NSBSTP`` on the :ref:`nsubst` command is greater than one. Flags (FSI, MXWF, MVDI,
        etc.) are always stepped.

        Changing the ramping ``KEY`` (that is, switching between ramped and stepped boundary conditions)
        between load steps is not recommended.

        For ramped loading ( :ref:`kbc`,0), when a load is applied for the first time, it is interpolated
        from zero to the value of the current load step, and not from the initial condition or value of the
        degree of freedom from the previous load step.

        Spatially varying tabular loads or boundary conditions do not support direct ramping or stepping
        options and, instead, apply their full values according to the supplied tabular functions regardless
        of the :ref:`kbc` setting.

        Regardless of the :ref:`kbc` setting, any tabular load is applied as step change. This is the case,
        for example, for a static or harmonic cyclic symmetry analysis with a load that varies by sector (
        :ref:`cycopt`, LDSECT). Note that when tabular and non-tabular loads are present in the same
        analysis, the non-tabular loads are ramped or stepped according to the :ref:`kbc` setting.

        Irrespective of the :ref:`kbc` setting, loads are usually step-removed. See `Stepping or Ramping
        Loads
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS2_7.html#bas.ch.2.tab.11.ft.5>`_

        information.

        It is sometimes difficult to obtain successful convergence with stepped loading in a nonlinear
        transient problem. If divergence is encountered, determine if stepped loading was used by default,
        then determine if it is appropriate for the analysis.

        .. _MAGSOLV_notes:

        :ref:`magsolv` invokes a Mechanical APDL macro which specifies magnetic solution options and
        initiates the

        vector
        potential (MVP), reduced scalar potential (RSP), difference scalar potential (DSP), general scalar
        potential (GSP), or combined MVP-RSP formulation options. Results are only stored for the final
        converged solution. (In POST1, issue :ref:`starset`,LIST to identify the load step of solution
        results.) The macro internally determines if a nonlinear analysis is required based on magnetic
        material properties.

        If you use the ``BIOT`` option and issue :ref:`save` after solution or postprocessing, the Biot-
        Savart calculations are saved to the database, but will be overwritten upon normal exit from the
        program. To save this data after issuing :ref:`save`, use the ``/EXIT``,NOSAVE command. You can
        also issue the ``/EXIT``,SOLU command to exit Mechanical APDL and save all solution data, including
        the

        calculation will be lost (resulting in a zero solution).

        The MVP, MVP-RSP, and edge formulation options perform a two-load-step solution sequence. The first
        load step ramps the applied loads over a prescribed number of substeps ( ``NRAMP`` ), and the second
        load step calculates the converged solution. For linear problems, only a single load step solution
        is performed. The ramped load step can be bypassed by setting ``NRAMP`` to -1.

        The RSP option solves in a single load step using the adaptive descent procedure. The DSP option
        uses two load steps, and the GSP solution uses three load steps.

        The following analysis options and nonlinear options are controlled by this macro: :ref:`kbc`,
        :ref:`neqit`, :ref:`nsubst`, :ref:`cnvtol`, :ref:`nropt`, :ref:`magopt`, and :ref:`outres`.

        You cannot use constraint equations with ``OPT`` = 4.

        When the ``BIOT`` option is on ( ``BIOT`` = 1), Distributed-Memory Parallel (DMP) restrictions may
        apply. For more information, see the :ref:`biot` command.

            model.

        nsbmn : str
            Minimum number of substeps to be taken (that is, the maximum time step size) if automatic time
            stepping is used. The program automatically determines the default based on the physics of the
            model.

        carry : str
            Time step carryover key (program-determined default depending on the problem physics):

            * ``OFF`` - Use ``NSBSTP`` to define time step at start of each load step.

            * ``ON`` - Use final time step from previous load step as the starting time step (if automatic time
              stepping is used).

        **Command Defaults**

        .. _NUMEXP_defaults:

        Issuing this command with no arguments is invalid. You must specify the number of solutions, or all
        solutions, to expand ( ``NUM`` ). The default value for both the beginning ( ``BEGRNG`` ) and ending
        ( ``ENDRNG`` ) time or frequency is 0. The default behavior of the command is to calculate element
        results, nodal loads, and reaction loads ( ``Elcalc`` = YES).

        .. _NUMEXP_notes:

        Specifies a range of solutions to be expanded from analyses that use mode-superposition methods (
        :ref:`antype`,HARMIC or TRANS) or substructuring ( :ref:`antype`,SUBSTR).

        For :ref:`antype`,TRANS, ``NUM``, evenly spaced solutions are expanded between time ``BEGRNG`` and
        time ``ENDRNG``.

        For :ref:`antype`,HARMIC, ``NUM``, evenly spaced solutions are expanded between frequency ``BEGRNG``
        and frequency ``ENDRNG``.

        The first expansion in all cases is done at the first point beyond ``BEGRNG`` (that is, at
        ``BEGRNG`` + ( ``ENDRNG`` - ``BEGRNG`` ) / ``NUM`` )).

        The resulting results file will maintain the same load step, substep, and time (or frequency) values
        as the use pass.

        For a single expansion of a solution, or for multiple expansions when the solutions are not evenly
        spaced (such as in a mode-superposition harmonic analysis with the cluster option),
        Ansys, Inc. recommends issuing one or more :ref:`expsol` commands.

        :ref:`numexp` is invalid in these cases:

          full- resolve method.

        * If the full-resolve option is selected ( :ref:`seopt` ).

        In both situations, issue :ref:`expsol` to perform a single expansion for each solution desired.

        The :ref:`upcoord` command uses displacements stored in the Mechanical APDL database, and not those

        command is issued. After updating, both the nodal displacements and rotations are set to zero if

        For structural solutions with an updated mesh, unless the coefficient matrix is otherwise reformed
        (for example, a new analysis or :ref:`nlgeom`,ON) it should first be reformed by issuing a
        :ref:`kuse`,-1 command.

        :ref:`upcoord` should not be issued between load steps in structural analysis.

        For a multiphysics simulation where a CFD or electromagnetic field is being coupled to a structure
        undergoing large displacements, all (or a portion) of the surrounding field mesh may take part in
        the structural solution to "move" with the displacing structure. You can use the :ref:`upcoord`
        command with a suitable ``FACTOR`` to update the coordinates of the nodes using the newly computed
        displacements. The mesh will now conform with the displaced structure for subsequent field
        solutions. However, the mesh should always be restored to its original location by using an
        :ref:`upcoord`, ``FACTOR`` command before performing any subsequent structural solutions. This is
        true for both repeated linear solutions, and for nonlinear restarts. (All saved displacements are
        relative to the original mesh location.)

        .. _USRCAL_notes:

        Allows certain user-solution subroutines to be activated or deactivated (system-dependent). This
        command only affects the subroutines named. Other user subroutines (such as user elements, user
        creep, etc.) have their own activation controls described with the feature.

        The UAnBeg subroutine that allows user access at the start of a run does not require activation by
        this command; it is automatically activated when the program is started.

        The routines are commented and should be listed after performing a custom installation from the
        distribution media for more details. See also the `Advanced Analysis Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_adv/advoceanloading.html>`_ for a
        general description of user-
        programmable features.

        You must have system permission, system access, and knowledge to write, compile, and link the
        appropriate subroutines into the program at your site.

        All routines should be written in FORTRAN. (For more information about FORTRAN compilers, refer to
        either the `Ansys, Inc. Windows Installation Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/installation/win_product_table.html>`_ or
        the `Ansys, Inc. Linux Installation Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/installation/lin_product_table.html>`_ for
        details specific to your platform or operating system.)

        Issue :ref:`usrcal`,STAT to list the status of these user subroutines.

        Because a user-programmed subroutine is a nonstandard use of the program, the verification of any
        Mechanical APDL run incorporating these commands is entirely your responsibility. In any contact
        with
        customer support regarding the performance of a custom version of Mechanical APDL, explicitly state
        that a
        user-programmable feature has been used.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ldstep : str
            Specify action to take:

            * ``OFF or 0`` - Turn off feature (default)

            * ``N`` - Turn on feature and set it to stop after assembling the global matrices and writing the
              :file:`.FULL` file for load step N.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _WRFULL_notes:

        This command is used in conjunction with the :ref:`solve` command to generate the assembled matrix
        file ( :file:`.FULL` file) only. The element matrices are assembled into the relevant global
        matrices for the particular analysis being performed and the :file:`.FULL` file is written. Equation
        solution and the output of data to the results file are skipped. To dump the matrices written on the
        :file:`.FULL` file into Harwell-Boeing format, use the :ref:`hbmat` command in /AUX2. To copy the
        matrices to a postscript format that can be viewed graphically, use the :ref:`psmat` command.

        To use the :ref:`lssolve` macro with this command, you may need to modify the :ref:`lssolve` macro
        to properly stop at the load step of interest.

        This command only valid for linear static, full harmonic, and full transient analyses when the
        sparse direct solver is selected. This command is also valid for buckling or modal analyses with any
        mode extraction method. This command is not valid for nonlinear analyses. It is not supported in a
        linear perturbation analysis.

        In general, the assembled matrix file :file:`.FULL` contains stiffness, mass, and damping matrices.
        However, the availability of the matrices depends on the analysis type chosen when the file is
        written. Some analyses do not write the matrices individually but instead write combined matrices.
        For example, a full transient writes a combined stiffness/mass/damping matrix to the full file.
