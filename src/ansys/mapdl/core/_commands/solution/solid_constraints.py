        .. _DK_notes:

        A keypoint may be flagged using ``KEXPND`` to allow its constraints to be expanded to nodes on the
        attached solid model entities having similarly flagged keypoint constraints. Constraints are
        transferred from keypoints to nodes with the :ref:`dtran` or :ref:`sbctran` commands. The expansion
        uses interpolation to apply constraints to the nodes on the lines between flagged keypoints. If all
        keypoints of an area or volume region are flagged and the constraints (label and values) are equal,
        the constraints are applied to the interior nodes of the region. See the :ref:`d` command for a
        description of nodal constraints.

        Tabular boundary conditions ( ``VALUE`` = ``%tabname%``) are available only for the following
