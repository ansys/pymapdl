        Mechanical APDL Command: `SFA <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SFA.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        area : str
            Area to which surface load applies. If ALL, apply load to all selected areas ( :ref:`asel` ). If
            ``Area`` = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored (valid
            only in the GUI). A component may be substituted for ``Area``.

        lkey : str
            Load key associated with surface load (defaults to 1). Load keys (1,2,3, etc.) are listed under
            "Surface Loads" in the input data table for each element type in the `Element Reference
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_BIBLIO.html>`_. ``LKEY``
            is ignored if the area is the face of a volume region meshed with volume elements.

        lab : str
            Valid surface load label. Load labels are listed under "Surface Loads" in the input table for
            each area type in the `Element Reference
            <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_BIBLIO.html>`_.

             This command contains some tables and extra information which can be inspected in the original
            documentation pointed above... _sfa1:

            Thermal labels CONV and HFLUX are mutually exclusive.

            .. _sfa2:

            For an acoustic analysis, apply the fluid-structure interaction flag (Label = FSI) to only the
            ``FLUID129`` or ``FLUID130`` elements.

        value : str
            Surface load value or table name reference for specifying tabular boundary conditions.

            If ``Lab`` = CONV:

            * ``VALUE`` is typically the film coefficient and ``VALUE2`` (below) is typically the bulk
              temperature. If ``Lab`` = CONV and ``VALUE`` = - ``N``, the film coefficient may be a function of
              temperature and is determined from the HF property table for material ``N`` ( :ref:`mp` ). (See
              the :ref:`scopt` command for a way to override this option and use - ``N`` as the film
              coefficient.) The temperature used to evaluate the film coefficient is usually the average between
              the bulk and wall temperatures, but may be user-defined for some elements.
            * If :ref:`kbc`,0 has been issued for ramped loads, it affects only ``VALUE2``, :ref:`the bulk
              temperature, and the film coefficient specification is unaffected. <SFA_V2CONV>`
            *

            If ``Lab`` = RAD, ``VALUE`` is the surface emissivity.

            If ``Lab`` = PORT, ``VALUE`` is a port number representing a waveguide exterior port. The port
            number must be an integer between 1 and 50. For acoustic 2×2 transfer admittance matrix, the port
            number can be any positive integer. The smaller port number corresponds to the port 1 of the 2×2
            transfer admittance matrix and the greater port number corresponds to the port 2. If one port of the
            transfer admittance matrix is connecting to the acoustic-structural interaction interface, the port
            number corresponds to the port 2 of the transfer admittance matrix. A pair of ports of the 2×2
            transfer admittance matrix must be defined in the same element.

            If ``Lab`` = SHLD, ``VALUE`` is the surface normal velocity in harmonic analysis and the surface
            normal acceleration in transient analysis for acoustics.

            If ``Lab`` = IMPD, ``VALUE`` is resistance in (N)(s)/m :sup:`3` if ``VALUE`` > 0 and is conductance
            in mho if ``VALUE`` < 0 for acoustics. In acoustic transient analyses, ``VALUE2`` is not used.

            If ``Lab`` = RDSF, ``VALUE`` is the emissivity value; the following conditions apply: If ``VALUE``
            is between 0 and 1, apply a single value to the surface. If ``VALUE`` = - ``N``, the emissivity may
            be a function of the temperature, and is determined from the EMISS property table for material ``N``
            ( :ref:`mp` ). The material ``N`` does not need to correlate with the underlying solid thermal
            elements.

            If ``Lab`` = FSIN in a unidirectional Mechanical APDL to CFX analysis, ``VALUE`` is not used.

            If ``Lab`` = ATTN, ``VALUE`` is the absorption coefficient of the surface.

        value2 : str
            Second surface load value (if any).

            If ``Lab`` = CONV:

            * ``VALUE2`` is typically the bulk temperature for thermal analyses.
            * If :ref:`kbc`,0 has been issued for ramped loads, the bulk temperature is ramped from the value
              defined by :ref:`tunif` to the value specified by ``VALUE2`` for the first loadstep. If
              :ref:`tabular boundary conditions are defined, the <SFA_tabBC>` :ref:`kbc` command is ignored and
              tabular values are used.
            * For acoustic analyses, VALUE2 is not used.

            If ``Lab`` = RAD ``VALUE2`` is ambient temperature.

            If ``Lab`` = SHLD, ``VALUE2`` is the phase angle of the normal surface velocity (defaults to zero)
            for harmonic response analyses while ``VALUE2`` is not used for transient analyses in acoustics.

            If ``Lab`` = IMPD, ``VALUE2`` is reactance in (N)(s)/m :sup:`3` if ``VALUE`` > 0 and is the product
            of susceptance and angular frequency if ``VALUE`` < 0 for acoustics.

            If ``Lab`` = RDSF, ``VALUE2`` is the enclosure number. Radiation will occur between surfaces flagged
            with the same enclosure numbers. If the enclosure is open, radiation will also occur to ambient. If
            ``VALUE2`` is negative, radiation direction is reversed and will occur inside the element for the
            flagged radiation surfaces.

            If ``Lab`` = FSIN in a unidirectional Mechanical APDL to CFX analysis, ``VALUE2`` is the surface interface
            number (not available from within the GUI).

        .. _SFA_notes:

        Surface loads may be transferred from areas to elements with the :ref:`sftran` or :ref:`sbctran`
        commands. See the :ref:`sfgrad` command for an alternate tapered load capability.

        Tabular boundary conditions Tabular boundary conditions ( ``VALUE`` = ``tabname`` and/or ``VALUE2``
        = ``tabname``) are available
        for the following surface load labels ( ``Lab`` ) only: PRES (real and/or imaginary components),
        CONV (film coefficient and/or bulk temperature) or HFLUX, and RAD (surface emissivity and ambient
        temperature). Use the :ref:`dim` command to define a table.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.

        Surface loads are transferred only from selected lines and areas to all selected elements. The
        :ref:`sftran` operation is also done if the :ref:`sbctran` command is issued or automatically done
        upon initiation of the solution calculations ( :ref:`solve` ).

        This command is also valid in PREP7.
