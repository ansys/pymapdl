        Parameters
        ----------
        node : str
            Node to which body load applies. If ``Node`` = ALL, apply to all selected nodes ( :ref:`nsel` ).
            A component name may also be substituted for ``Node``.

            * 0 - Nodal body-force loading occurs on the current mesh (default).
            * 1 - Nodal body-force loading occurs on the initial mesh for nonlinear adaptivity.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _BF_notes:

        Defines a nodal body-force load (such as temperature in a structural analysis, heat generation rate
        in a thermal analysis, etc.). Nodal body loads default to the :ref:`bfunif` values, if they were
        previously specified.

        Table names are valid for ``Lab`` value ( ``VALn`` ) inputs in these cases only:

        * ``VAL1`` = ``tabname`` for:

        temperatures (TEMP), diffusing substance generation rates (DGEN), and heat generation rates (HGEN).

        * ``VAL1`` = ``tabname1`` and ``VAL2`` = ``tabname2`` for:

        mass source, mass source rate, or power source (MASS); the Floquet periodic boundary condition
          (FPBC); the force potential (UFOR); and the volumetric heat source (HFLW).

        * ``VAL1`` = ``tabname1``, ``VAL2`` = ``tabname2``, and ``VAL3`` = ``tabname3`` for:

        mean flow velocities (VMEN).

        * ``VAL1`` = ``tabname1``, ``VAL2`` = ``tabname2``, ``VAL3`` = ``tabname3``, ``VAL4`` =
          ``tabname4``, ``VAL5`` = ``tabname5``, and ``VAL6`` = ``tabname6`` for:

        velocities or accelerations (VELO); and shear force (SFOR).

        The heat generation rate loads specified with the :ref:`bf` command are multiplied by the weighted
        nodal volume of each element adjacent to that node. This yields the total heat generation at that
        node.

        In a modal analysis, the Floquet periodic boundary condition (FPBC) is only valid for the acoustic
        elements ``FLUID30``, ``FLUID220``, and ``FLUID221``.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        .. _BFCUM_notes:

        Allows repeated nodal body-force loads to be replaced, added, or ignored. Nodal body loads are
        applied with the :ref:`bf` command. Issue the :ref:`bflist` command to list the nodal body loads.
        The operations occur when the next body loads are defined. For example, issuing the :ref:`bf`
        command with a temperature of 250 after a previous :ref:`bf` command with a temperature of 200
        causes the new value of the temperature to be 450 with the add operation, 250 with the replace
        operation, or 200 with the ignore operation. A scale factor is also available to multiply the next
        value before the add or replace operation. A scale factor of 2.0 with the previous "add" example
        results in a temperature of 700. The scale factor is applied even if no previous values exist. Issue
        :ref:`bfcum`,STAT to show the current label, operation, and scale factors. Solid model boundary
        conditions are not affected by this command, but boundary conditions on the FE model are affected.
        FE boundary conditions may still be overwritten by existing solid model boundary conditions if a
        subsequent boundary condition transfer occurs.

        :ref:`bfcum` does not work for tabular boundary conditions.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _BFE_notes:

        Defines an element body-force load (such as the temperature in a structural analysis or the heat-
        generation rate in a thermal analysis). Body loads and element specific defaults are described for
        each element type in the `Element Reference
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_BIBLIO.html>`_. If both the
        :ref:`bf` and :ref:`bfe` commands are used to apply a
        body-force load to an element, the :ref:`bfe` command takes precedence.

        Imaginary values for FORC loading via :ref:`bfe` is supported by current-technology solid elements (
        ``PLANE182``, ``PLANE183``, ``SOLID185``, ``SOLID186``, ``SOLID187``, and ``SOLID285`` ) and
        reinforcing elements ( ``REINF263``, ``REINF264``, and ``REINF265`` ). Use only for modal or
        harmonic analyses. Large-deflection effects must be disabled ( :ref:`nlgeom`,OFF).

        The following topics for applying HGEN loading via the :ref:`bfe` command are available:

        For HGEN loading on layered thermal solid elements ``SOLID278`` / ``SOLID279`` (KEYOPT(3) = 1 or 2),
        or layered thermal shell elements ``SHELL131`` / ``SHELL132`` (KEYOPT(3) = 1), ``STLOC`` refers to
        the layer number (not the node). In such cases, specify ``VAL1`` through ``VAL4`` to specify the
        heat-generation values for the appropriate layers. Heat generation is constant over the layer.

        For HGEN loading on `reinforcing
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/str_compreinfdirectemb.html>`_
        elements ``REINF263``, ``REINF264``, and ``REINF265``, ``STLOC`` refers to the corner locations of
        the reinforcing members (individual reinforcings):

        * ``REINF263`` and ``REINF264`` : Specify ``VAL1`` and ``VAL2`` for each member. For tables, specify
          ``VAL1`` only.

        * ``REINF265`` : Specify ``VAL1``, ``VAL2``, ``VAL3``, and ``VAL4`` for each member. For tables,
          specify ``VAL1`` only.

        For FORC loading on reinforcing elements, ``STLOC`` refers to real ( ``STLOC`` = 1) or imaginary (
        ``STLOC`` = 4) components.

        When using the `standard method
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/strreinfworkflow.html#>`_ for
        defining reinforcing, this is the only way to apply a body load (HGEN or FORC) on the reinforcing
        members created after generating the REINF ``nnn`` reinforcing elements ( :ref:`ereinf` ). If
        applying FORC loading, Mechanical APDL applies a uniform load to all reinforcing members if there
        are
        multiple members in selected elements.

        When using the `mesh-independent method
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_str/strreinfworkflow.html#>`_ for
        defining reinforcing, you can apply a body load on the reinforcing members in the same way. The
        preferred method, however, is to apply loads on the ``MESH200`` elements (via :ref:`bfe` or
        :ref:`bf` for HGEN, BFE for FORC) before generating the REINF ``nnn`` reinforcing elements (
        :ref:`ereinf` ). Mechanical APDL maps the loads from the ``MESH200`` elements to the newly generated
        REINF
        ``nnn`` reinforcing elements automatically. If you need to apply the loads after generating the
        reinforcing elements, apply them to ``MESH200`` elements and issue :ref:`bfport` to transfer the
        loads to the reinforcing members.

        You can specify a table name ( ``VAL1`` ) when using temperature (TEMP), diffusing substance
        generation rate (DGEN), heat generation rate (HGEN), and current density (JS) body load labels.

        For the body-force-density label (FORC), you can specify a table for any of the ``VAL1`` through
        ``VAL3`` arguments. Both 1D and 2D tables are valid; however, only 1D tables are valid in mode-
        superposition harmonic and mode-superposition transient analyses.

        Enclose the table name ( ``tabname`` ) in percent signs (%), for example :

        :ref:`bfe`, ``Elem``, ``Lab``, ``STLOC``,``tabname``

        Use the :ref:`dim` command to define a table. For information on primary variables for each load
        type, see `Applying Loads Using Tabular Input
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS2_6.html#gbas5dexample>`_

        For ``Lab`` = TEMP, each table defines ``NTEMP`` temperatures, as follows:

        * For layered elements, ``NTEMP`` is the number of layer interface corners that allow temperature
          input.

        * For non-layered elements, ``NTEMP`` is the number of corner nodes.

        The temperatures apply to element items with a starting location of ``STLOC`` + ``n``, where n is
        the value field location ( ``VALn`` ) of the table name input.

        For layered elements, a single :ref:`bfe` command returns temperatures for one layer interface.
        Multiple :ref:`bfe` commands are necessary for defining all layered temperatures.

        For beam, pipe and elbow elements that allow multiple temperature inputs per node, define the
        tabular load for the first node only (Node I), as loads on the remaining nodes are applied
        automatically. For example, to specify a tabular temperature load on a ``PIPE288`` element with the
        through-wall-gradient option (KEYOPT(1) = 0), the :ref:`bfe` command looks like this:

        :ref:`bfe`, ``Elem``,TEMP,1,``tabOut``, ``tabIn%``

        where %

         ``tabOut`` and ``tabIn`` and are the tables applied to the outer and inner surfaces of the pipe
        wall, respectively.

        When a tabular function load is applied to an element, the load does not vary according to the
        positioning of the element in space.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        .. _BFUNIF_notes:

        In a transient or nonlinear thermal analysis, the uniform temperature is used during the first
        iteration of a solution as follows: (a) as the starting nodal temperature except where temperatures
        are explicitly specified ( :ref:`d`, :ref:`dk` ), and (b) to evaluate temperature-dependent material
        properties. In a structural analysis, the uniform temperature is used as the default temperature for
        thermal strain calculations and material property evaluation except where body load temperatures are
        specified ( :ref:`bf`, :ref:`bfe`, :ref:`bfk`, :ref:`ldread` ). In other scalar field analyses, the
        uniform temperature is used for material property evaluation.

        An alternate command, :ref:`tunif`, may be used to set the uniform temperature instead of
        :ref:`bfunif`,TEMP. Since :ref:`tunif` (or :ref:`bfunif`,TEMP) is step-applied in the first
        iteration, you should use :ref:`bf`, ALL, TEMP, Value to ramp on a uniform temperature load.

        You can specify a table name only when using temperature (TEMP), heat generation rate (HGEN), and
        diffusing substance generation rate (DGEN) body load labels. When using TEMP, you can define a one-
        dimensional table that varies with respect to time (TIME) only. When defining this table, enter TIME
        as the primary variable. No other primary variables are valid.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Parameters
        ----------

        Notes

        .. _TUNIF_notes:

        :ref:`tunif` is a convenient form of the more general :ref:`bfunif` command.

        In a transient or nonlinear thermal analysis, the uniform temperature is used during the first
        iteration of a solution as follows:

        * as the starting nodal temperature, except where temperatures are explicitly specified ( :ref:`d`,
          :ref:`dk` )

        * to evaluate temperature-dependent material properties.

        In a structural analysis, the uniform temperature is used as the
         default temperature for thermal strain calculations and material property evaluation, except where body load
        temperatures are specified ( :ref:`bf`, :ref:`bfe`, :ref:`bfk`, :ref:`ldread` ). In other scalar
        field analyses, the uniform temperature is used for material property evaluation.

        Because :ref:`tunif` (or :ref:`bfunif`,TEMP) is step-applied in the first iteration, issue a
        :ref:`bf`,ALL,TEMP, ``Value`` command to ramp on a uniform temperature load.

        The command default sets the uniform temperature to the reference temperature defined via the
        :ref:`tref` command only (and not the :ref:`mp`,REFT command).

        If using the command default to set the uniform temperature (to the reference temperature set via
        :ref:`tref` ), you can convert temperature-dependent secant coefficients of thermal expansion
        (SCTEs) from the definition temperature to the uniform temperature. To do so, issue the
        :ref:`mpamod` command.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.
