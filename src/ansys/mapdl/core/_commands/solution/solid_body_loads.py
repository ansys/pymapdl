        val1 : str
            Value associated with the ``Lab`` item or a table name for specifying tabular boundary
            conditions. Use only ``VAL1`` for TEMP, FLUE, HGEN, MVDI and CHRGD. For magnetics, use ``VAL1``,
            ``VAL2``, and ``VAL3`` for the X, Y, and Z components of JS. For acoustics, if ``Lab`` = JS, use
            ``VAL1`` for mass source in a harmonic analysis or mass source rate in a transient analysis, and
            ignore ``VAL2`` and ``VAL3``. When specifying a table name, you must enclose the table name in
            percent signs (%), e.g., :ref:`bfk`, ``Kpoi``, ``Lab``,``%tabname%``. Use the :ref:`dim`
            command to define a table.

        val2 : str
            Value associated with the ``Lab`` item or a table name for specifying tabular boundary

        .. _BFK_notes:

        Defines a body-force load (such as temperature in a structural analysis, heat generation rate in a
        thermal analysis, etc.) at a keypoint. Body loads may be transferred from keypoints to nodes with
        the :ref:`bftran` or :ref:`sbctran` commands. Interpolation will be used to apply loads to the nodes
        on the lines between keypoints. All keypoints on a given area (or volume) must have the same
        :ref:`bfk` specification, with the same values, for the loads to be transferred to interior nodes in
        the area (or volume). If only one keypoint on a line has a :ref:`bfk` specification, the other
        keypoint defaults to the value specified on the :ref:`bfunif` command.

        You can specify a table name only when using temperature (TEMP) and heat generation rate (HGEN) body
        load labels.

        Body loads specified by the :ref:`bfk` command can conflict with other specified body loads. See
        Resolution of Conflicting Body Load Specifications in the `Basic Analysis Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS19.html>`_ for details.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.

        thermal analysis, etc.) on an area. Body loads may be transferred from areas to area elements (or to
        nodes if area elements do not exist) with the :ref:`bftran` or :ref:`sbctran` commands. Body loads
        default to the value specified on the :ref:`bfunif` command, if it was previously specified.

        You can specify a table name only when using temperature (TEMP) and heat generation rate (HGEN) body
        load labels.

        Body loads specified by the :ref:`bfa` command can conflict with other specified body loads. See
        Resolution of Conflicting Body Load Specifications in the `Basic Analysis Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BAS19.html>`_ for details.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in the modal portion
        of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load vector and writes it to the :file:`MODE` file,
        which you
        can apply via the :ref:`lvscale` command.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        line : str
            Line to which body load applies. If ALL, apply to all selected lines ( :ref:`lsel` ). A

        lab : str
            Valid body load label. Load labels are listed under "Body loads" in the input table for each

            This command contains some tables and extra information which can be inspected in the original

        val1 : str
            Value associated with the ``Lab`` item or a table name for specifying tabular boundary
            conditions. Use only ``VAL1`` for TEMP, FLUE, HGEN, and CHRGD. For acoustics, if ``Lab`` = JS,
            use ``VAL1`` for mass source in a harmonic analysis or mass source rate in a transient analysis,
            and ignore ``VAL2`` and ``VAL3``. When specifying a table name, you must enclose the table name
            in percent signs (%), for example, :ref:`bfl`, ``Line``, ``Lab``,``%tabname%``. Use the
            :ref:`dim` command to define a table.

        val2 : str
            Value associated with the ``Lab`` item or a table name for specifying tabular boundary
            conditions. Use only ``VAL1`` for TEMP, FLUE, HGEN, and CHRGD. For acoustics, if ``Lab`` = JS,

        val3 : str
            Value associated with the ``Lab`` item or a table name for specifying tabular boundary
            conditions. Use only ``VAL1`` for TEMP, FLUE, HGEN, and CHRGD. For acoustics, if ``Lab`` = JS,

        val4 : str
            If ``Lab`` = JS, ``VAL4`` is the phase angle in degrees.
