        Parameters
        ----------
        option : str
            * ``DEFINE`` - Define variables for the specified ``MatId`` material ID (default).

            * ``LIST`` - List the defined variables for the specified ``MatId`` material ID.

        matid : str
            The material ID for the state variables which you are defining ( ``Option`` = DEFINE) or listing
            ( ``Option`` = LIST).

            When ``Option`` = LIST, the default value for this argument is ALL (which lists all defined
            variables). When ``Option`` = DEFINE, you must explicitly specify a material ID.

        istrtstress : str
            The start position of stress-like tensors in the state variables. This value must be either a
            positive integer or 0 (meaning no stress-like tensors).

        ntenstress : str
            The number of stress-like tensors in the state variables. This value must be either a positive
            integer (or 0), and all stress-like tensors must be contiguous.

        istrtstrain : str
            The start position of strain-like tensors in the state variables. This value must be either a
            positive integer or 0 (meaning no strain-like tensors).

        ntenstrain : str
            The number of strain-like tensors in the state variables. This value must be either a positive
            integer (or 0), and all strain-like tensors must be contiguous.

        istrtvect : str
            The start position of vectors in the state variables. This value must be either a positive
            integer or 0 (meaning no vectors).

        nvect : str
            The number of vectors in the state variables. This value must be either a positive integer (or
            0), and all vectors must be contiguous.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _MAPVAR_notes:

        The :ref:`mapvar` command identifies the tensors and vectors in user-defined state variables (
        :ref:`tb`,STATE) for user-defined materials ( :ref:`tb`,USER and `UserMat
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_prog/Z7K4r1e5lcd.html#>`_ or `UserMatTh
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_prog/Z7K4r1e5lcd.html#>`_ ) or user-
        defined creep laws ( :ref:`tb`,CREEP,,,,100 and UserCreep ).

        To handle large-rotation effects and to correctly differentiate between tensor- and vector-mapping,
        specify the start position of specific state variables. For stress-like tensors, the shear
        components saved as state variables are the tensor component. For strain-like tensors, the shear
        components saved as state variables are twice the tensor components. Therefore, issue the
        :ref:`mapvar` command to define the stress-like and strain-like tensors individually. The command
        ensures that user-defined state variables are mapped correctly during `rezoning
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_nlad/Hlp_G_ADVRZSMP.html>`_ and in `2D

        In a rezoning operation, :ref:`mapvar` must be issued after remeshing ( :ref:`remesh`,FINISH) but
        before mapping ( :ref:`mapsolve` ).

              remeshing method to use on the selected region(s). This method is currently  the default and
              only option.

        ldstep : str
            The load step number at which rezoning should occur. The default value is the highest load step
            number found in the :file:`Jobname.Rnnn` files (for the current jobname and in the current
            directory).

        sbstep : str
            The substep number of the specified load step ( ``LDSTEP`` ) at which rezoning should occur. The
            default value is the highest substep number found in the specified load step in the

        Notes
        -----

        .. _REZONE_notes:

        The :ref:`rezone` command rebuilds the database ( :file:`.db` file) based on the specified load step

        Parameters
        ----------
        action : str
            * ``START`` - Starts the remeshing operation.

            * ``FINISH`` - Ends the remeshing operation.

            * ``READ`` - Reads in a generic ( :file:`.cdb` format) new mesh file generated by a third-party
              application. This remeshing option applies to both 2D and 3D rezoning.

            * ``SPLIT`` - Splits selected elements of an existing 2D or 3D mesh such that a quadrilateral
              element is split into four quadrilaterals, a degenerate quadrilateral is split into three
              quadrilaterals, and a quadratic triangular element is split into four quadratic triangles. A
              tetrahedral element is split into eight tetrahedra.

        filename : str
            Name of a :file:`.cdb` generic mesh file. The default value is :file:`jobname`. Valid only when
            ``Action`` = READ.

        ext : str
            File name extension. The only valid (and the default) extension is CDB. Valid only when
            ``Action`` = READ.

        opt1 : str
            Specifies options for the new mesh when using a generic imported mesh file or the mesh-splitting
            remeshing method. Valid only when ``Action`` = READ or ``Action`` = SPLIT.

            * ``REGE`` - Regenerates all node and element numbers on the new mesh using an offset of the highest
              existing node and element numbers. This is the default behavior when ``Action`` = READ; otherwise,
              this value is ignored.

            * ``KEEP`` - Keeps the similarly numbered nodes and elements in the new and the old meshes
              unchanged. Valid only when ``Action`` = READ.

            * ``TRAN`` - Generates transition elements to ensure nodal compatibility between split and unsplit
              parts of the mesh. Valid only when ``Action`` = SPLIT for 2D analyses.

        opt2 : str
            Specifies transition options for the mesh when elements are split. These options are valid only when
            ``Action`` = SPLIT for 2D analyses.

            * ``QUAD`` - Minimizes the number of degenerate elements in the transition mesh and tries to
              maximize the number of quadrilateral transition elements across several layers of elements from the
              split regions. This is the default behavior.

            * ``DEGE`` - Creates transition zones between the split and unsplit parts of the mesh using mostly
              degenerate elements with a single element layer.

        Notes
        -----
        This command is valid only during the rezoning ( :ref:`rezone` ) process.

        In rezoning, :ref:`remesh`,START exits the solution processor temporarily and enters a special mode
        of the PREP7 preprocessor, after which a limited number of preprocessing commands are available for
        `mesh control
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_nlad/Hlp_G_ADVRZREM.html#advrezcmdtbl>`_,
        but no solution commands are valid.

        :ref:`remesh`,FINISH exits the remeshing process and reenters the solution processor, at which point
        no preprocessing commands are available. If the new mesh exists, the command creates contact
        elements if needed, and transfers all boundary conditions (BCs) and loads from the original mesh to
        the new mesh. You can issue any list or plot command to verify the created contact elements,
        transferred BCs, and loads. :ref:`remesh`,FINISH is valid only after a previously issued
        :ref:`remesh`,START, and is the only way to safely end the remeshing operation (and exit the special
        mode of PREP7).

        :ref:`remesh`,READ is valid only when you want to perform a rezoning operation using a generic new
        mesh generated by a third-party application (rather than a new mesh generated internally by
        Mechanical APDL). The command is valid between :ref:`remesh`,START and :ref:`remesh`,FINISH. In this
        case,
        the only valid file extension is :file:`.cdb` ( ``Ext`` = CDB). When ``Option`` = KEEP, Mechanical
        APDL
        assumes that the common node and element numbers between the old and the new mesh are topologically
        similar (that is, these commonly numbered areas have the same element connectivity and nodal
        coordinates).

        :ref:`remesh`,SPLIT is valid only when performing a rezoning operation via splitting the existing
        mesh. The command is valid between :ref:`remesh`,START and :ref:`remesh`,FINISH.

        You can use :ref:`remesh`,READ and :ref:`remesh`,SPLIT for horizontal multiple rezoning provided
        that the meshes used in :ref:`remesh`,READ do not intersect. (Avoid issuing :ref:`aremesh` after
        issuing either of these commands.)
