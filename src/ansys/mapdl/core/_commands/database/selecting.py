        Parameters
        ----------
        type_ : str
            Label identifying the type of volume select:

            * ``S`` - Select a new set (default).

            * ``R`` - Reselect a set from the current set.

            * ``A`` - Additionally select a set and extend the current set.

            * ``U`` - Unselect a set from the current set.

            * ``ALL`` - Restore the full set.

            * ``NONE`` - Unselect the full set.

            * ``INVE`` - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            * ``STAT`` - Display the current select status.

        item : str
            Label identifying data. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some items also require
            a component label. If ``Item`` = PICK (or simply "P"), graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). Defaults to VOLU.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.

        vmin : str
            Minimum value of item range. Ranges are volume numbers, coordinate values, attribute numbers,
            etc., as appropriate for the item. A component name (as specified on the :ref:`cm` command) may
            also be substituted for ``VMIN`` ( ``VMAX`` and ``VINC`` are ignored). If ``Item`` = MAT, TYPE,
            REAL, or ESYS and if ``VMIN`` is positive, the absolute value of ``Item`` is compared against
            the range for selection; if ``VMIN`` is negative, the signed value of ``Item`` is compared. See
            the :ref:`vlist` command for a discussion of signed attributes.

        vmax : str
            Maximum value of item range. ``VMAX`` defaults to ``VMIN``.

        vinc : str
            Value increment within range. Used only with integer ranges (such as for volume numbers).
            Defaults to 1. ``VINC`` cannot be negative.

        kswp : int or str
            Specifies whether only volumes are to be selected:

            * ``0`` - Select volumes only.

            * ``1`` - Select volumes, as well as keypoints, lines, areas, nodes, and elements associated with
              selected volumes. Valid only with ``Type`` = S.

           This function contains specificities regarding the argument definitions.
           Please refer to the `command documentation <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_VSEL.html>`_
           for further explanations.

        .. _VSEL_notes:

        Selects volumes based on values of a labeled item and component. For example, to select a new set of
        volumes based on volume numbers 1 through 7, use :ref:`vsel`,S,VOLU,,1,7. The subset is used when
        the ALL label is entered (or implied) on other commands, such as :ref:`vlist`,ALL. Only data
        identified by volume number are selected. Data are flagged as selected and unselected; no data are
        actually deleted from the database.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        For Selects based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.), items that are within the
        range VMIN- ``Toler`` and VMAX+ ``Toler`` are selected. The default tolerance ``Toler`` is based on
        the relative values of VMIN and VMAX as follows:

        * If VMIN = VMAX, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x VMIN.

        * If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

        * If VMAX ≠ VMIN, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

        Use the `SELTOL
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SELTOL.html#SELTOL.menupath>`_
        :ref:`seltol` command to override this default and specify ``Toler`` explicitly.

        Selects lines based on values of a labeled item and component. For example, to select a new set of
        lines based on line numbers 1 through 7, use :ref:`lsel`,S,LINE,,1,7. The subset is used when the
        ALL label is entered (or implied) on other commands, such as :ref:`llist`,ALL. Only data identified
        by line number are selected. Data are flagged as selected and unselected; no data are actually
        deleted from the database.

        If ``Item`` = LCCA, the command selects only those lines that were created by concatenation. The
        ``KSWP`` field is processed, but the ``Comp``, ``VMIN``, ``VMAX``, and ``VINC`` fields are ignored.

        If ``Item`` = HPT, the command selects only those lines that contain hard points.

        ``Item`` = RADIUS is only valid for lines that are circular arcs.

        :ref:`lsel` is valid in any processor.

        For selections  based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.), items that are
        within the range ``VMIN`` - ``Toler`` and ``VMAX`` + ``Toler`` are selected. The default tolerance
        ``Toler`` is based on the relative values of ``VMIN`` and ``VMAX`` as follows:

        * If ``VMIN`` = ``VMAX``, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x ``VMIN``.

        * If ``VMIN`` = ``VMAX`` = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

            * ``STAT`` - Display the current select status.

        item : str
            Label identifying data, see :ref:`ESEL.tab.1`. Some items also require a component label. If
            ``Item`` = PICK (or simply "P"), graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields
            are ignored (valid only in the GUI). Defaults to ELEM. If ``Item`` = STRA (straightened),
            elements are selected whose midside nodes do not conform to the curved line or non-flat area on
            which they should lie. (Such elements are sometimes formed during volume meshing ( :ref:`vmesh`
            ) in an attempt to avoid excessive element distortion.) You should graphically examine any such
            elements to evaluate their possible effect on solution accuracy.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in :ref:`ESEL.tab.1`below.

        vmin : str
            Minimum value of item range. Ranges are element numbers, attribute numbers, load values, or
            result values as appropriate for the item. A component name (as specified via the :ref:`cm`
            command) can also be substituted for ``VMIN`` (in which case ``VMAX`` and ``VINC`` are ignored).

        vmax : str
            Maximum value of item range. ``VMAX`` defaults to ``VMIN`` for input values.

            For result values, ``VMAX`` defaults to infinity if ``VMIN`` is positive, or to zero if ``VMIN``
            is negative.

        vinc : str
            Value increment within range. Used only with integer ranges (such as for element and attribute
            numbers). Defaults to 1. ``VINC`` cannot be negative.

        kabs : int or str
            Absolute value key:

            * ``0`` - Check sign of value during selection.

            * ``1`` - Use absolute value during selection (sign ignored).

        Notes
        -----

        .. warning::

           This function contains specificities regarding the argument definitions.
           Please refer to the `command documentation <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ESEL.html>`_
           for further explanations.

        .. _ESEL_notes:

        Selects elements based on values of a labeled item and component. For example, to select a new set
        of elements based on element numbers 1 through 7, use :ref:`esel`,S,ELEM,,1,7. The subset is used
        when the ALL label is entered (or implied) on other commands, such as :ref:`elist`,ALL. Only data
        identified by element number are selected. Selected data are internally flagged; no actual removal
        of data from the database occurs. Different element subsets cannot be used for different load steps
        ( :ref:`solve` ) in a :ref:`slashsolu` sequence. The subset used in the first load step is used for
        all subsequent load steps regardless of subsequent :ref:`esel` specifications.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Elements crossing the named path ( :ref:`path` ) are selected. This option is available only in
        PREP7 and POST1. If no geometry data has been mapped to the path (via :ref:`pmap` and :ref:`pdef`,
        for example), the path assumes the default mapping option ( :ref:`pmap`,UNIFORM) to map the geometry
        prior to selecting the elements. If an invalid path name is given, the :ref:`esel` command is
        ignored (and the status of selected elements is unchanged). If no elements are crossing the path,
        the :ref:`esel` command returns zero elements selected.

        For selections based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.), items that are within the
        range ``VMIN`` - ``Toler`` and ``VMAX`` + ``Toler`` are selected. The default tolerance ``Toler`` is
        based on the relative values of ``VMIN`` and ``VMAX`` as follows:

        * If ``VMIN`` = ``VMAX``, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x ``VMIN``.

        * If ``VMIN`` = ``VMAX`` = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

        * If ``VMAX`` ≠ ``VMIN``, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-8 x ( ``VMAX`` - ``VMIN`` ).

        To override this default and specify ``Toler`` explicitly, issue the `SELTOL
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SELTOL.html#SELTOL.menupath>`_
        :ref:`seltol` command.

        ----------
        type_ : str
            Label identifying the type of select:

            * ``S`` - Select a new set (default).

            * ``R`` - Reselect a set from the current set.

            * ``ALL`` - Restore the full set.

            * ``NONE`` - Unselect the full set.

            * ``INVE`` - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            * ``STAT`` - Display the current select status.

        item : str
            Label identifying data. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some items also require
            a component label. If ``Item`` = PICK (or simply "P"), graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). Defaults to NODE.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.

        vmin : str
            Minimum value of item range. Ranges are node numbers, set numbers, coordinate values, load
            values, or result values as appropriate for the item. A component name (as specified on the
            :ref:`cm` command) may also be substituted for ``VMIN`` ( ``VMAX`` and ``VINC`` are ignored).

        vmax : str
            Maximum value of item range. ``VMAX`` defaults to ``VMIN`` for input values. For result values,
            ``VMAX`` defaults to infinity if ``VMIN`` is positive, or to zero if ``VMIN`` is negative.

        vinc : str
            Value increment within range. Used only with integer ranges (such as for node and set numbers).
            Defaults to 1. ``VINC`` cannot be negative.

        kabs : int or str
            Absolute value key:

            * ``0`` - Check sign of value during selection.

            * ``1`` - Use absolute value during selection (sign ignored).

        .. warning::

           This function contains specificities regarding the argument definitions.
           Please refer to the `command documentation <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_NSEL.html>`_
           for further explanations.

        .. _NSEL_notes:

        Selects a subset of nodes. For example, to select a new set of nodes based on node numbers 1 through
        7, use :ref:`nsel`,S,NODE,,1,7. The subset is used when the ALL label is entered (or implied) on
        other commands, such as :ref:`nlist`,ALL. Only data identified by node number are selected. Data are
        flagged as selected and unselected; no data are actually deleted from the database.

        When selecting nodes by results, the full graphics value is used, regardless of whether
        PowerGraphics is on.

        Solution result data consists of two types, 1) nodal degree of freedom--results initially calculated
        at the nodes (such as displacement, temperature, pressure, etc.), and 2) element--results initially
        calculated elsewhere (such as at an element integration point or thickness location) and then
        recalculated at the nodes (such as stresses, strains, etc.). Various element results also depend
        upon the recalculation method and the selected results location ( :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`rsys`,
        :ref:`force`, :ref:`layer` and :ref:`shell` ).

        You must have all the nodes (corner and midside nodes) on the external face of the element selected
        to use ``Item`` = EXT.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        For Selects based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.), items that are within the
        range VMIN- ``Toler`` and VMAX+ ``Toler`` are selected. The default tolerance ``Toler`` is based on
        the relative values of VMIN and VMAX as follows:

        * If VMIN = VMAX, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x VMIN.

        * If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

        * If VMAX ≠ VMIN, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

        Use the `SELTOL
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SELTOL.html#SELTOL.menupath>`_
        :ref:`seltol` command to override this default and specify ``Toler`` explicitly.

        .. _ALLSEL_notes:

        :ref:`allsel` is a convenience command that allows the user to select all items of a specified
        entity type or to select items associated with the selected items of a higher entity.

        An entity hierarchy is used to decide what entities will be available in the selection process. This
        hierarchy from top to bottom is as follows: volumes, areas, lines, keypoints, elements, and nodes.
        The hierarchy may also be divided into two branches: the solid model and the finite element model.
        The label ALL selects items based on one branch only, while BELOW uses the entire entity hierarchy.
        For example, :ref:`allsel`,ALL,VOLU selects all volumes, areas, lines, and keypoints in the data
        base. :ref:`allsel`,BELOW,AREA selects all lines belonging to the selected areas; all keypoints
        belonging to those lines; all elements belonging to those areas, lines, and keypoints; and all nodes
        belonging to those elements.

        The $ character should not be used after the :ref:`allsel` command.

            * ``INVE`` - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            * ``STAT`` - Display the current select status.

        item : str
            Label identifying data. Valid item labels are shown in :ref:`asel.tab.1`. Some items also
            require a component label. If ``Item`` = PICK (or simply "P"), graphical picking is enabled and
            all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). Defaults to AREA.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in :ref:`asel.tab.1`.

        vmin : str
            Minimum value of item range. Ranges are area numbers, coordinate values, attribute numbers,
            etc., as appropriate for the item. A component name (as specified on the :ref:`cm` command) may
            also be substituted for ``VMIN`` ( ``VMAX`` and ``VINC`` are ignored). If ``Item`` = MAT, TYPE,
            REAL, or ESYS and if ``VMIN`` is positive, the absolute value of ``Item`` is compared against
            the range for selection; if ``VMIN`` is negative, the signed value of ``Item`` is compared. See
            the :ref:`alist` command for a discussion of signed attributes.

        vmax : str
            Maximum value of item range. ``VMAX`` defaults to ``VMIN``.

        vinc : str
            Value increment within range. Used only with integer ranges (such as for area numbers). Defaults
            to 1. ``VINC`` cannot be negative.

        kswp : int or str
            Specifies whether only areas are to be selected:

            * ``0`` - Select areas only.

            * ``1`` - Select areas, as well as keypoints, lines, nodes, and elements associated with selected
              areas. Valid only with ``Type`` = S.

        .. _ASEL_notes:

        Selects a subset of areas. For example, to select those areas with area numbers 1 through 7, use
        :ref:`asel`,S,AREA,,1,7. The selected subset is then used when the ALL label is entered (or implied)
        on other commands, such as :ref:`alist`,ALL. Only data identified by area number are selected. Data
        are flagged as selected and unselected; no data are actually deleted from the database.

        In a cyclic symmetry analysis, area hot spots can be modified. Consequently, the result of an area
        selection may be different before and after the :ref:`cyclic` command.

        If ``Item`` = ACCA, the command selects only those areas that were created by concatenation. The
        ``KSWP`` field is processed, but the ``Comp``, ``VMIN``, ``VMAX``, and ``VINC`` fields are ignored.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        For Selects based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.), items that are within the
        range VMIN- ``Toler`` and VMAX+ ``Toler`` are selected. The default tolerance ``Toler`` is based on
        the relative values of VMIN and VMAX as follows:

        * If VMIN = VMAX, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x VMIN.

        * If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

        * If VMAX ≠ VMIN, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

        Use the `SELTOL

        The default tolerance logic is based on the relative values of VMIN and VMAX as follows:

        * If VMIN = VMAX, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x VMIN.

        * If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

        * If VMAX ≠ VMIN, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

        This command is typically used when VMAX-VMIN is very large so that the computed default tolerance
        is therefore large and the xSEL  commands selects more than what is desired.

        ``Toler`` remains active until respecified by a subsequent :ref:`seltol` command. A :ref:`seltol` <
        blank > resets back to the default ``Toler`` logic.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type_ : str
            Label identifying the type of select:

            * ``S`` - Select a new set (default).

            * ``R`` - Reselect a set from the current set.

            * ``A`` - Additionally select a set and extend the current set.

            * ``U`` - Unselect a set from the current set.

            * ``ALL`` - Restore the full set.

            * ``NONE`` - Unselect the full set.

            * ``INVE`` - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            * ``STAT`` - Display the current select status.

        item : str
            Label identifying data. Valid item labels are shown in the table below. Some items also require
            a component label. If ``Item`` = PICK (or simply "P"), graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). Defaults to KP.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). Valid component labels are shown in the table below.

        vmin : str
            Minimum value of item range. Ranges are keypoint numbers, coordinate values, attribute numbers,
            etc., as appropriate for the item. A component name (as specified on the :ref:`cm` command) may
            also be substituted for ``VMIN`` ( ``VMAX`` and ``VINC`` are ignored). If ``Item`` = MAT, TYPE,
            REAL, or ESYS and if ``VMIN`` is positive, the absolute value of ``Item`` is compared against
            the range for selection; if ``VMIN`` is negative, the signed value of ``Item`` is compared. See
            the :ref:`klist` command for a discussion of signed attributes.

        vmax : str
            Maximum value of item range. ``VMAX`` defaults to ``VMIN``.

        vinc : str
            Value increment within range. Used only with integer ranges (such as for keypoint numbers).
            Defaults to 1. ``VINC`` cannot be negative.

        kabs : int or str
            Absolute value key:

            * ``0`` - Check sign of value during selection.

            * ``1`` - Use absolute value during selection (sign ignored).

        .. warning::

           This function contains specificities regarding the argument definitions.
           Please refer to the `command documentation <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_KSEL.html>`_
           for further explanations.

        .. _KSEL_notes:

        Selects a subset of keypoints or hard points. For example, to select a new set of keypoints based on
        keypoint numbers 1 through 7, use :ref:`ksel`,S,KP,,1,7. The selected subset is used when the ALL
        label is entered (or implied) on other commands, such as :ref:`klist`,ALL. Only data identified by
        keypoint number are selected. Data are flagged as selected and unselected; no data are actually
        deleted from the database.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        For selections based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.), items that are within the
        range ``VMIN`` - ``Toler`` and ``VMAX`` + ``Toler`` are selected. The default tolerance ``Toler`` is
        based on the relative values of ``VMIN`` and ``VMAX`` as follows:

        * If ``VMIN`` = ``VMAX``, ``Toler`` = 0.005 x ``VMIN``.

        * If ``VMIN`` = ``VMAX`` = 0.0, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-6.

        * If ``VMAX`` ≠ ``VMIN``, ``Toler`` = 1.0E-8 x ( ``VMAX`` - ``VMIN`` ).

        Use the `SELTOL
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_cmd/Hlp_C_SELTOL.html#SELTOL.menupath>`_
        :ref:`seltol` command to override this default and specify ``Toler`` explicitly.
