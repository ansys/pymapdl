        Parameters
        ----------
        snap : str
            Snap increment for a locational pick (1E-6 minimum). If -1, turn off snap capability. For
            example, a picked location of 1.2456 with a snap of 0.1 gives 1.2, with 0.01 gives 1.25, with
            0.001 gives 1.246, and with 0.025 gives 1.250 (defaults to 0.05).

        grspac : str
            Graphical spacing between grid points. For graphical representation only and not related to snap
            points (defaults to 0.1).

        grmin : str
            Defines the size of a square grid (if ``WPCTYP`` = 0) to be displayed over a portion of the
            working plane. The opposite corners of the grid will be located at grid points nearest the
            working plane coordinates of ( ``GRMIN``, ``GRMIN`` ) and ( ``GRMAX``, ``GRMAX`` ). If a polar
            system ( ``WPCTYP`` = 1), ``GRMAX`` is the outside radius of grid and ``GRMIN`` is ignored. If
            ``GRMIN`` = ``GRMAX``, no grid will be displayed (defaults to -1.0 and 1.0 for ``GRMIN`` and
            ``GRMAX`` respectively).

        grmax : str
            Defines the size of a square grid (if ``WPCTYP`` = 0) to be displayed over a portion of the
            working plane. The opposite corners of the grid will be located at grid points nearest the
            working plane coordinates of ( ``GRMIN``, ``GRMIN`` ) and ( ``GRMAX``, ``GRMAX`` ). If a polar
            system ( ``WPCTYP`` = 1), ``GRMAX`` is the outside radius of grid and ``GRMIN`` is ignored. If
            ``GRMIN`` = ``GRMAX``, no grid will be displayed (defaults to -1.0 and 1.0 for ``GRMIN`` and
            ``GRMAX`` respectively).

        wptol : str
            The tolerance that an entity's location can deviate from the specified working plane, while
            still being considered on the plane. Used only for locational picking of vertices for polygons
            and prisms (defaults to 0.003).

        wpctyp : int or str
            Working plane coordinate system type:

            * ``0`` - Cartesian (default). If working plane tracking is on ( :ref:`csys`,4), the updated active
              coordinate system will also be Cartesian.

            * ``1`` - Polar. If working plane tracking is on, the updated active coordinate system will be
              cylindrical.

            * ``2`` - Polar. If working plane tracking is on, the updated active coordinate system will be
              spherical.

        grtype : int or str
            Grid type:

            * ``0`` - Grid and WP triad.

            * ``1`` - Grid only.

            * ``2`` - WP triad only (default).

        wpvis : int or str
            Grid visibility:

            * ``0`` - Do not show ``GRTYPE`` entities (grid and/or triad) (default).

            * ``1`` - Show ``GRTYPE`` entities. Cartesian working planes will be displayed with a Cartesian
              grid, polar with a polar grid.

        snapang : str
            Snap angle (0--180) in degrees. Used only if ``WPCTYP`` = 1 or 2. Defaults to 5 degrees.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _WPSTYL_notes:

        Use :ref:`wpstyl`,DEFA to reset the working plane to its default location and style. Use
        :ref:`wpstyl`,STAT to list the status of the working plane. Blank fields will keep present settings.

        It is possible to specify ``SNAP`` and ``WPTOL`` values that will cause conflicts during picking
        operations. Check your values carefully, and if problems are noted, revert to the default values.

        :ref:`wpstyl` with no arguments will toggle the grid on and off. The working plane can be displayed
        in the non-GUI interactive mode only after issuing a :ref:`plopts`,WP,1 command. See the `Modeling
        and Meshing Guide
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_mod/Hlp_G_MOD14.html>`_
        for more information on working plane tracking. See :ref:`plopts` command for control of hidden line
        working plane.
