        snap
            Snap increment for a locational pick (1E-6 minimum).  If -1, turn
            off snap capability.  For example, a picked location of 1.2456 with
            a snap of 0.1 gives 1.2, with 0.01 gives 1.25, with 0.001 gives
            1.246, and with 0.025 gives 1.250 (defaults to 0.05).

        grspac
            Graphical spacing between grid points.  For graphical
            representation only and not related to snap points  (defaults to
            0.1).

        grmin, grmax
            Defines the size of a square grid (if WPCTYP = 0) to be displayed
            over a portion of the working plane.  The opposite corners of the
            grid will be located at grid points nearest the working plane
            coordinates of (GRMIN,GRMIN) and (GRMAX,GRMAX).  If a polar system
            (WPCTYP = 1), GRMAX is the outside radius of grid and GRMIN is
            ignored.  If GRMIN = GRMAX, no grid will be displayed (defaults to
            -1.0 and 1.0 for GRMIN and GRMAX respectively).

        wptol
            The tolerance that an entity's location can deviate from the
            specified working plane, while still being considered on the plane.
            Used only for locational picking of vertices for polygons and
            prisms (defaults to 0.003).

        wpctyp
            Working plane coordinate system type:

            0 - Cartesian (default).  If working plane tracking is on [CSYS,4], the updated
                active coordinate system will also be Cartesian.

            1 - Polar.  If working plane tracking is on, the updated active coordinate system
                will be cylindrical.

            2 - Polar.  If working plane tracking is on, the updated active coordinate system
                will be spherical.

        grtype
            Grid type:

            0 - Grid and WP triad.

            1 - Grid only.

            2 - WP triad only (default).

        wpvis
            Grid visibility:

            0 - Do not show GRTYPE entities (grid and/or triad) (default).

            1 - Show GRTYPE entities.  Cartesian working planes will be displayed with a
                Cartesian grid, polar with a polar grid.

        snapang
            Snap angle (0--180) in degrees.  Used only if WPCTYP = 1 or 2.
            Defaults to 5 degrees.

        Notes
        -----
        Use WPSTYL,DEFA to reset the working plane to its default location and
        style.  Use WPSTYL,STAT to list the status of the working plane.  Blank

        It is possible to specify SNAP and WPTOL values that will cause

        if problems are noted, revert to the default values.
