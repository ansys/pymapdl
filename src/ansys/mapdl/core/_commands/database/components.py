        r"""Groups geometry items into a component.

        Mechanical APDL Command: `CM <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_CM.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        cname : str
            An alphanumeric name used to identify this component. ``Cname`` may be up to 256 characters,
            beginning with a letter and containing only letters, numbers, dots (.) and underscores (_).
            Component names beginning with an underscore (for example, _LOOP) are reserved for use by
            Mechanical APDL and should be avoided. Components named "ALL," "STAT," and "DEFA" are not
            permitted. Overwrites a previously defined name.

        entity : str
            Label identifying the type of geometry items to be grouped:

            * ``VOLU`` - Volumes.

            * ``AREA`` - Areas.

            * ``LINE`` - Lines.

            * ``KP`` - Keypoints.

            * ``ELEM`` - Elements.

            * ``NODE`` - Nodes.

        kopt : str
            Controls how element component contents are updated during `nonlinear mesh adaptivity analysis <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_nlad/advmnaexample.html>`_ :

            * 0 - Component is not updated during remeshing and therefore contains only initial mesh elements
              (default).
            * 1 - Component is updated during remeshing to contain the updated elements.

            This argument is valid only for nonlinear mesh adaptivity analysis with ``Entity`` = ELEM, and for
            solid element components only.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _CM_notes:

        Components may be further grouped into assemblies ( :ref:`cmgrp` ). The selected items of the
        specified entity type will be stored as the component. Use of this component in the select command (
        :ref:`cmsel` ) causes all these items to be selected at once, for convenience.

        A component is a grouping of some geometric entity that can then be conveniently selected or
        unselected. A component may be redefined by reusing a previous component name. The following entity
        types may belong to a component: nodes, elements, keypoints, lines, areas, and volumes. A component
        may contain only 1 entity type, but an individual item of any entity may belong to any number of
        components. Once defined, the items contained in a component may then be easily selected or
        unselected ( :ref:`cmsel` ). Components may be listed ( :ref:`cmlist` ), modified ( :ref:`cmmod` )
        and deleted ( :ref:`cmdele` ). Components may also be further grouped into assemblies ( :ref:`cmgrp`
        ). Other entities associated with the entities in a component (for example, the lines and keypoints
        associated with areas) may be selected by the :ref:`allsel` command.

        An item will be deleted from a component if it has been deleted by another operation (see the
        :ref:`kmodif` command for an example). Components are automatically updated to reflect deletions of
        one or more of their items. Components are automatically deleted and a warning message is issued if
        all their items are deleted. Assemblies are also automatically updated to reflect deletions of one
        or more of their components or subassemblies, but are not deleted if all their components and
        subassemblies are deleted.

        For `nonlinear mesh adaptivity analysis
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_nlad/advmnaexample.html>`_, an extra
        option is available to update the element component contents automatically during the analysis,
        applicable in cases where the remeshing region overlaps the defined solid element component region.
        By enabling the option, the component element boundary is maintained, and the validity of the
        defined component is guaranteed during the entire analysis run; therefore, the component can be used
        during both solution and postprocessing.

        Components are often used as input to other commands. Some commands restrict the component name to
        32 characters. For those commands, this limitation is documented within the command description.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        to 5 levels of assemblies within assemblies may be used.

        An assembly is a convenient grouping of previously defined components and other assemblies.
        Assemblies may contain components only, other assemblies, or any combination. A component may belong
        to any number of assemblies. Up to 5 levels of nested assemblies may be defined. Components and
        assemblies may be added to or deleted from an existing assembly by the :ref:`cmedit` command. Once

        a component. Assemblies are automatically updated to reflect deletions of one or more of their
        components or lower-level assemblies. Assemblies are not automatically deleted when all their

        .. _CMSEL_notes:

        Selecting by component is a convenient adjunct to individual item selection (for example,
        :ref:`vsel`, :ref:`esel`, etc.). :ref:`cmsel`, ALL allows you to select components **in addition**
        to other items you have already selected.

        If ``Type`` = R for an assembly selection ( :ref:`cmsel`,R,< assembly-name >), the reselect
        operation is performed on each component in the assembly in the order in which the components make
        up the assembly. Thus, if one reselect operation results in an empty set, subsequent operations will
        also result in empty sets. For example, if the first reselect operation tries to reselect node 1
        from the selected set of nodes 3, 4, and 5, the operation results in an empty set (that is, no nodes
        are selected). Since the current set is now an empty set, if the second reselect operation tries to
        reselect any nodes, the second operation also results in an empty set, and so on. This is equivalent
        to repeating the command :ref:`cmsel`,R,< component-name > once for each component making up the
        assembly.
