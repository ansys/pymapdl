        Mechanical APDL Command: `ANSOL <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_ANSOL.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        nvar : str
            Arbitrary reference number assigned to this variable (2 to ``NV`` ( :ref:`numvar` )). Overwrites
            any existing results for this variable.

        node : str
            Node number for which data are to be stored.

        item : str
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in :ref:`ANSOL_tab_1` below. Some
            items also require a component label.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are shown in :ref:`ANSOL_tab_1`.
            Selected result components ( ``Item`` = SRES) are shown in :ref:`ANSOL_tab_2`.

        name : str
            32-character name to identify the item on the printout and displays. Default: An eight-character
            label formed by concatenating the first four characters of the ``Item`` and ``Comp`` labels.

        mat : str
            Material number. Average is calculated based on the subset of elements with the specified
            material number. Default: Use all elements in the active set unless ``Real`` and/or ``Ename`` is
            specified.

        real : str
            Real number. Average is calculated based on the subset of elements with the specified real
            number. Default: Use all elements in the active set unless ``Mat`` and/or ``Ename`` is
            specified.

        ename : str
            Element type name. Average is calculated based on the subset of elements with the specified
            element type name. Default: Use all elements in the active set unless ``Mat`` and/or ``Real`` is
            specified.

        datakey : str
            Key to specify which data is stored:

            * ``AUTO`` - `Nodal-averaged results
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_ are
              used if they are available for the first applicable time step; otherwise, the element-based data is
              used, if available. (Default.)

            * ``ESOL`` - Only element-based results are used. If they are not available, the command is ignored.

            * ``NAR`` - Only nodal-averaged results are used. If they are not available, the command is ignored.

            ``Mat``, ``Real``, and ``Ename`` are ignored when nodal-averaged results are used.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _ANSOL_notes:

        Valid item and component labels for element nodal results are listed in :ref:`ANSOL_tab_1`.

        :ref:`ansol` defines element nodal results data to be stored from a results file ( ``FILE`` ). Not
        all items are valid for all nodes. See the input and output summary tables of each element attached
        to the node for the available items.

        If `nodal-averaged results
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_ (
        :ref:`outres`,NAR or another nodal-averaged label) are available, then :ref:`ansol` uses the nodal-
        averaged data for the applicable items (S, EPEL, EPPL, EPCR, EPTH) as dictated by the by ``DataKey``
        argument. By default, ( ``DataKey`` = AUTO), the availability of nodal-averaged results or element-
        based data is determined at the first load step that has results for the associated item. For more
        information, see `Postprocessing Nodal-Averaged Results
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#>`_

        **Coordinate systems:** Generally, element nodal quantities stored by :ref:`ansol` are obtained in
        the solution coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys`, SOLU) and then averaged. There are some exceptions as
        listed below. :ref:`ansol` does not transform results from :ref:`rsys`,SOLU (or from the coordinate
        systems described for the exceptions below) to other coordinate systems. Verify that all elements
        attached to the subject node have the same coordinate system before using :ref:`ansol`.

        * Layered element results are in the layer coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys`,LSYS). You can further
          specify the element nodal results, for some elements, with the :ref:`shell`, :ref:`layerp26`, and
          :ref:`force` commands.

        * When :ref:`ansol` is used to store nodal-averaged result data (based on the ``DataType`` setting),
          the global Cartesian coordinate system ( :ref:`rsys`,0) is used.

        **Shell elements:** The default shell element coordinate system is based on node ordering. For shell
        elements the
        adjacent elements could have a different :ref:`rsys`,SOLU, making the resultant averaged data
        inconsistent. A message to this effect is issued when :ref:`ansol` is used in models containing
        shell elements. Ensure that consistent coordinate systems are active for all associated elements
        used by the :ref:`ansol` command.

        **Derived quantities:** Some of the result items supported by :ref:`ansol` ( :ref:`ANSOL_tab_1` )
        are derived from the component quantities. Issue :ref:`avprin` to specify the principal and vector
        sum quantity averaging methods.

        **Default:** If ``Mat``, ``Real``, and ``Ename`` are not specified, all elements attached to the
        node are considered. When a material ID, real constant ID, or element-type discontinuity is detected
        at a node, a message is issued. For example, in a FSI analysis, a ``FLUID30`` element at the
        structure interface would be considered; however, because it contains no SX result, it is not used
        during :ref:`store` operations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nvar : str
            Arbitrary reference number assigned to this variable (2 to ``NV`` ( :ref:`numvar` )). Overwrites
            any existing results for this variable.

        elem : str
            Element for which data are to be stored. If ``ELEM`` = P, graphical picking is enabled (valid
            only in the GUI).

        node : str
            Node number on this element for which data are to be stored. If blank, store the average element
            value (except for ``FMAG`` values, which are summed instead of averaged). If ``NODE`` = P,
            graphical picking is enabled (valid only in the GUI).

        item : str
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in :ref:`ESOL_tab_1`. Some items also
            require a component label.

        comp : str
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are shown in :ref:`ESOL_tab_1`
            below. If ``Comp`` is a sequence number ( ``n`` ), the ``NODE`` field is ignored.

        name : str
            32-character name for identifying the item on the printout and displays. Defaults to a label
            formed by concatenating the first four characters of the ``Item`` and ``Comp`` labels.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _ESOL_notes:

        See :ref:`ESOL_tab_1` for a list of item and component labels for element (excluding line element)
        results. See :ref:`ESOL_tab_2` for a list of valid selected result ( ``Item`` = SRES) components.

        :ref:`esol` defines element results data to be stored from a results file ( ``FILE`` ). Not all
        items are valid for all elements. To see the available items for a given element, refer to the input
        and output summary tables in the documentation for that element.

        Two methods of data access are available via the :ref:`esol` command. You can access some data by
        using a generic label ( component name method ), while others require a label and number ( sequence
        number method ).

        Use the component name method to access general element data (that is, element data generally
        available to most element types or groups of element types). Element results are in the element
        coordinate system, except for layered elements where results are in the layer coordinate system.
        Element forces and moments are in the nodal coordinate system. Results are obtainable for an element
        at a specified node. Further location specifications can be made for some elements via :ref:`shell`,
        :ref:`layerp26`, and :ref:`force`.

        The sequence number method is required for data that is not averaged (such as pressures at nodes and
        temperatures at integration points), or data that is not easily described generically (such as all
        derived data for structural line elements and contact elements, all derived data for thermal line
        elements, and layer data for layered elements).

        command not supported in the POST26 postprocessor and is ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab : str
            Valid labels:

            * ``MERGE`` - Merge data from results file for the time points in memory with the existing data
              using current specifications (default).

            * ``NEW`` - Store a new set of data, replacing any previously stored data with current result file
              specifications and deleting any previously-calculated variables (see ).

              Variables defined using the :ref:`ansol` command are also deleted if they represent element-based
              results. Variables created using `nodal-averaged results
              <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_elem/Hlp_E_CH2_2.html#nodeavepost>`_ are
              not deleted.

            * ``APPEN`` - Append data from results file to the existing data.

            * ``ALLOC`` - Allocate (and zero) space for ``NPTS`` data points.

            * ``PSD`` - Create a new set of frequency points for PSD calculations (replacing any previously
              stored data and erasing any previously calculated data).

        npts : str
            The number of time points (or frequency points) for storage (used only with ``Lab`` = ALLOC or
            PSD). The value may be input when using POST26 with data supplied from other than a results
            file. This value is automatically determined from the results file data with the NEW, APPEN, and
            MERGE options. For the PSD option, ``NPTS`` determines the resolution of the frequency vector
            (valid numbers are between 1 and 10, defaults to 5).

        freq : str
            A frequency value, or an array containing frequency values (Hz). Use :ref:`dim` to define the
            array and enclose the array name in percent signs (for example, :ref:`store`,,,,``arrayname``).
            A default value of 1% of damping is considered for clustering around the user-input frequency
            values. Supported for ``Lab`` = PSD only.

        toler : str
            Tolerance to determine if a user-input frequency value ( ``FREQ`` ) is a duplicate and can be
            ignored. Two frequency values are considered duplicates if their difference is smaller than the
            frequency range multiplied by the tolerance. The default value is 10 :sup:`-5`. Supported for
            ``Lab`` = PSD and ``Cluster`` = YES only.

        cluster : str
            Key to control whether or not to consider the clustering frequencies around each of the user-input
            array values. Available only when a user-defined frequency array is used ( ``FREQ`` ).

            * ``YES`` - Merge the clustering frequencies around both the natural frequencies and the frequency
              values entered in the user-defined array ( ``FREQ`` ) (default).

            * ``NO`` - Do not include clustering frequencies, and use only natural frequencies and the
              frequencies in the user-defined array ( ``FREQ`` ).

        .. _STORE_notes:

        This command stores data from the results file in the database for the defined variables (
        :ref:`ansol`, :ref:`nsol`, :ref:`esol`, :ref:`solu`, :ref:`jsol` ) per specification (
        :ref:`avprin`, :ref:`force`, :ref:`layerp26`, :ref:`shell` ). See `Storing the Variable
        <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en/ans_bas/Hlp_G_BASP26define.html#>`_

        The :ref:`store`,PSD command creates a new frequency vector (variable 1) for response PSD
        calculations ( :ref:`rpsd` ). This command should first be issued before defining variables (
        :ref:`nsol`, :ref:`esol`, :ref:`rforce` ) for which response PSD's are to be calculated.

        If the frequencies in the user-defined array are relevant, turning off clustering ( ``Cluster`` =
        NO) reduces calculation costs without significant loss of accuracy. You can check the frequencies by
        initially issuing a default :ref:`rpsd` (with clustering) to obtain a reference plot of the
        response.
