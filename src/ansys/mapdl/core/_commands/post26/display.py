        Mechanical APDL Command: `KEEP <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_KEEP.html>`_

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : str
            State or value

            * ``On or 1`` - Allows you to exit and reenter :ref:`post26` without losing your current time
              history variable information. Keeps a cache of the :ref:`post26` variable information including the
              active file name ( ``FILE`` ), variable definitions ( :ref:`nsol`, :ref:`esol`, :ref:`rforce`, and
              :ref:`solu` ) and stored variable data in memory for the current Mechanical APDL session.

            * ``Off or 0`` - :ref:`post26` variable information is deleted when you exit :ref:`post26`.

        Notes
        -----

        .. _KEEP_notes:

        Your variable information is saved in memory only for the current active Mechanical APDL session. It
        is
        deleted when you exit Mechanical APDL. This information is also deleted when you issue ``/CLEAR``,
        :ref:`resume`, :ref:`solve`, or :ref:`reset`.

        When you reenter :ref:`post26` all time history variable data is available for use. When you issue
        :ref:`store`, NEW, variable definitions created by math operations such as :ref:`add` or :ref:`prod`
        will not be restored. However, variables defined with :ref:`nsol`, :ref:`esol`, :ref:`rforce`, and
        :ref:`solu`  will be restored. Only the last active results file name is kept in memory ( ``FILE``
        ).

        Commands such as :ref:`layerp26`, :ref:`shell`, and :ref:`force` that specify the location or a
        component of data to be stored will retain the setting at the time of exiting :ref:`post26`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : int or str
            Complex variable part:

            * ``0`` - Amplitude.

            * ``1`` - Phase angle.

            * ``2`` - Real part.

        .. _PLCPLX_notes:

        Used only with harmonic analyses ( :ref:`antype`,HARMIC).

        All results data are stored in the form of real and imaginary components and converted to amplitude
