        Mechanical APDL Command: `EMIS <https://ansyshelp.ansys.com/Views/Secured/corp/v232/en//ans_cmd/Hlp_C_EMIS.html>`_

        **Command default:**

        .. _EMIS_default:

        Since there is no :ref:`command default value for emissivity, you must issue <ans_cmd_cmdDef>`
        :ref:`emis` to specify it. Otherwise, an error message appears. If you issue :ref:`emis` without
        defining a numerical value, emissivity defaults to 0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mat : str
            Material number associated with this emissivity (500 maximum). Defaults to 1.

        evalu : str
            Emissivity for this material (0.0 < ``EVALU``  :math:`equation not available`  1.0).  Enter a
            very small number for zero.

        Notes
        -----

            specified (6 :math:`equation not available`   ``NDIV``  :math:`equation not available`  90).
