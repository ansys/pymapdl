Mesh and Geometry
=================
The ``ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl`` class allows you to access the mesh and
geometry without writing to an intermediate file or interpreting the
text output from various MAPDL commands.  For example, to access the
nodes and elements of a model, normally one would list the nodes
within MAPDL ``NLIST``, but this generates a string and array access
either requires cumbersome MAPDL GET commands, or requires the nodes
be written to a archive file and then read in within other software.
For example:

.. code::

    NLIST

 LIST ALL SELECTED NODES.   DSYS=      0

    NODE        X             Y             Z           THXY     THYZ     THZX
        1   0.0000        0.0000        0.0000          0.00     0.00     0.00
        2   1.0000        0.0000        0.0000          0.00     0.00     0.00
        3   0.2500        0.0000        0.0000          0.00     0.00     0.00


However, with ``ansys-mapdl-core``, it's possible to interface with a
current instance of ``Mapdl`` and access the current nodes coordinates
with:

.. code:: python

   >>> mapdl.mesh.nodes
   [[0.   0.   0.  ]
    [1.   0.   0.  ]
    [0.25 0.   0.  ]
    ...,
    [0.75 0.5  3.5 ]
    [0.75 0.5  4.  ]
    [0.75 0.5  4.5 ]]


Both the ``geometry`` and ``mesh`` attributes support additional,
lower level access to MAPDL data.  Access them with:

.. code:: python

    >>> mapdl.mesh
    >>> mapdl.geometry

View the current mesh status with:

.. code::

   >>> mapdl.mesh
    ANSYS Mesh
      Number of Nodes:              7217
      Number of Elements:           2080
      Number of Element Types:      2
      Number of Node Components:    0
      Number of Element Components: 0
