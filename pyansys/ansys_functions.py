        APDL Command: PDSHIS

        Plots the sample history values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rlab
            Result set label. Identifies the result set to be used for
            postprocessing. A result set label can be the solution set label
            you defined in a PDEXE command, or the response surface set label
            defined in an RSFIT command.

        name
            Parameter name. The parameter must have been previously defined as
            a random input variable or a random output parameter using the
            PDVAR command.

        type
            Keyword to identify which type of data is to be plotted:

            SAMP - Sampled values (default).

            MEAN - Mean values for results based on Monte Carlo simulation methods only.

            STDV - Standard deviations for results based on Monte Carlo simulation methods only.

            MIN - Minimum values for results based on Monte Carlo simulation methods only.

            MAX - Maximum values for results based on Monte Carlo simulation methods only.

        conf
            Confidence level. The confidence level is used to plot confidence
            bounds for the history value. The value for the confidence level
            must be between 0.0 and 1.0 and it defaults to 0.95 (95%).
            Confidence bound(s) plotting is suppressed for CONF  0.5. This
            option is ignored for Type = SAMP (no confidence bounds are
            plotted).

        Notes
        -----
        Plots the sample history values as a function of the number of
        simulation loops.

        If Rlab is left blank, then the result set label is inherited from the
        last PDEXE command (Slab), RSFIT command (RSlab), or the most recently
        used PDS postprocessing command where a result set label was explicitly
        specified.

        The confidence level is a probability expressing the confidence that
        the value for the requested probability is in fact between the
        confidence bounds. The larger the confidence level, the wider the
        confidence bounds. For Type = MEAN and Type = STDV, lower and upper
        confidence curves are plotted. For Type = MEAN, the mean value curve
        starts at the first simulation and the confidence bounds start with
        simulation number 2. For Type = MIN only the upper confidence bound is
        shown (the interpretation is that by a certain probability the true
        minimum value is below this curve). This probability (or confidence) is
        set using CONF. Likewise, for Type = MAX, only the lower confidence
        bound is shown. For all Type options, confidence curves are plotted
        starting with the simulation at which enough data is available to
        calculate the bounds. However, for scaling reasons, no confidence
        bounds are plotted for simulation numbers 1 to 5 even if they might be
        available.

        lab
            Valid force label.  Structural labels:  FX, FY, or FZ (forces); MX,

            labels:  FLUX (magnetic flux);  CSGX, CSGY, or CSGZ (magnetic
            current segments).  Diffusion labels: RATE (diffusion flow rate).

        value
            Force value or table name reference for specifying tabular boundary
            conditions.  To specify a table, enclose the table name in percent
            signs (%), e.g., F, NODE,HEAT,%tabname%).  Use the *DIM command to
            define a table.

        value2
            Second force value (if any).  If the analysis type and the force
            allow a complex input, VALUE (above) is the real component and
            VALUE2 is the imaginary component.

        Notes
        -----
        The available force loads per node correspond to the degrees of freedom
        listed under "Degrees of Freedom" in the input table for each element
        type in the Element Reference.  If both a force and a constrained
        degree of freedom [D] are specified at the same node, the constraint
        takes precedence.  Forces are defined in the nodal coordinate system.
        The positive directions of structural forces and moments are along and
        about the positive nodal axis directions.  The node and the degree of
        freedom label corresponding to the force must be selected [NSEL,
        DOFSEL].

        For hydrostatic fluid elements (HSFLD241 and HSFLD242), DVOL is used to
        specify fluid mass flow rate (with units of mass/time) at the pressure
        node. This allows fluid to be added or taken out of the fluid elements
        sharing the pressure node. A fluid density must also be specified (via
        the MP command or TB command) to apply a volume change corresponding to
        the prescribed fluid mass flow rate.

            The name of the resulting array parameter vector.  See *SET  for
            name restrictions.

        par1
            First array parameter vector in the operation.  May also be a
            scalar parameter or a literal constant.

        oper
            Operations:

            Addition: Par1+Par2. - Subtraction: Par1-Par2.

            Multiplication: Par1*Par2. - Division: Par1/Par2  (a divide by zero results in a value of zero).

            Minimum: minimum of Par1 and Par2. - Maximum: maximum of Par1 and Par2.

            Less than comparison: Par1<Par2 gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false. - Less than or equal comparison: Par1 Par2 gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false.

            Equal comparison: Par1 = Par2 gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false. - Not equal comparison: Par1 ≠ Par2 gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false.

            Greater than or equal comparison: Par1 Par2 gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false. - Greater than comparison: Par1>Par2 gives 1.0 if true, 0.0 if false.

            First derivative: d(Par1)/d(Par2).  The derivative at a point is determined  over points half way between the previous and next points (by linear  interpolation). Par1 must be a function (a unique Par1 value for each Par2 value) and Par2 must be in ascending order. - Second derivative: d2(Par1)/d(Par2)2.  See also DER1.

            Single integral:    Par1 d(Par2), where CON1 is the integration constant.  The integral at a point is determined by using the single integration procedure described in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference. - Double integral:       Par1 d(Par2), where CON1 is the integration constant of
                              the first integral and CON2 is the integration
                              constant of the second integral.  If Par1
                              contains acceleration data, CON1 is the initial
                              velocity and CON2 is the initial displacement.
                              See also INT1.

            Dot product: Par1  . Par2.  Par1 and Par2 must each have three consecutive columns of data, with the columns containing the i, j, and k vector components, respectively.  Only the starting row index and the column index for the i components are specified for Par1 and Par2, such as A(1,1).  The j and k components of the vector are assumed to begin in the corresponding next columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3). - Cross product: Par1 x Par2.  Par1, Par2, and ParR must each have 3 components,
                              respectively.  Only the starting row index and
                              the column index for the i components are
                              specified for Par1, Par2, and ParR, such as
                              A(1,1).  The j and k components of the vector are
                              assumed to begin in the corresponding next
                              columns, such as A(1,2) and A(1,3).

            Gather:  For a vector of position numbers, Par2, copy the value of Par1 at each position number to ParR.  Example:  for Par1 = 10,20,30,40 and Par2 = 2,4,1;  ParR = 20,40,10. - Scatter:  Opposite of GATH operation.  For a vector of position numbers, Par2,
                              copy the value of Par1 to that position number in
                              ParR.  Example: for Par1 = 10,20,30,40,50 and
                              Par2 = 2,1,0,5,3; ParR = 20,10,50,0,40.

            Arctangent: arctangent of Par1/Par2 with the sign of each component considered. - Transform the data in Par1 from the global Cartesian coordinate system to the
                              local coordinate system given in CON1. Par1 must
                              be an N x 3 (i.e., vector) or an N x 6 (i.e.,
                              stress or strain tensor) array. If the local
                              coordinate system is a cylindrical, spherical, or
                              toroidal system, then you must provide the global
                              Cartesian coordinates in Par2 as an N x 3 array.
                              Set CON2 = 1 if the data is strain data.

        par2
            Second array parameter vector in the operation.  May also be a
            scalar parameter or a literal constant.

        con1
            First constant (used only with the INT1 and INT2 operations).

        con2
            Second constant (used only with the INT2 operation).

        Notes
        -----
        Operates on two input array parameter vectors and produces one output
        array parameter vector according to:

        ParR = Par1 o Par2

        where the operations (o) are described below.  ParR may be the same as
        Par1 or Par2.  Absolute values and scale factors may be applied to all
        parameters [*VABS, *VFACT].  Results may be cumulative [*VCUM].
        Starting array element numbers must be defined for each array parameter
        vector if it does not start at the first location, such as
        *VOPER,A,B(5),ADD,C(3) which adds the third element of C to the fifth
        element of B and stores the result in the first element of A.
        Operations continue on successive array elements [*VLEN, *VMASK] with
        the default being all successive elements.  Skipping array elements via
        *VMASK or *VLEN for the DER_ and INT_ functions skips only the writing
        of the results (skipped array element data are used in all
        calculations).

        Parameter functions and operations are available to operate on a scalar
        parameter or a single element of an array parameter, such as SQRT(B) or
        SQRT(A(4)).  See the *SET command for details.  Operations on a
        sequence of array elements can be done by repeating the desired
        function or operation in a do-loop [*DO].  The vector operations within
        the ANSYS program (*VXX commands) are internally programmed do-loops
        that conveniently perform the indicated operation over a sequence of
        array elements.  If the array is multidimensional, only the first
        subscript is incremented in the do-loop, that is, the operation repeats
        in column vector fashion "down" the array.  For example, for A(1,5),
        A(2,5), A(3,5), etc.  The starting location of the row index must be
        defined for each parameter read and for the result written.

        The default number of loops is from the starting result location to the
        last result location and can be altered with the *VLEN command.  A
        logical mask vector may be defined to control at which locations the
        operations are to be skipped [*VMASK].  The default is to skip no
        locations.  Repeat operations automatically terminate at the last array
        element of the result array column if the number of loops is undefined
        or if it exceeds the last result array element.  Zeroes are used in
        operations for values read beyond the last array element of an input
        array column.  Existing values in the rows and columns of the results

            plane or solid structural elements adjacent to the interface being
            meshed.

        kcn
            Coordinate system number for the separation surface and normal
            direction. (if ecomps1 and ecomps2 not specified)

        kdir
            Direction (x, y, or z) normal to separation surface in the KCN
            coordinate system (if ecomps1 and ecomps2 not specified).

        value
            Coordinate value along the KDIR axis at which to locate the
            interface (if ecomps1 and ecomps2 not specified).

        cztol
            Optional absolute tolerance about VALUE (if ecomps1 and ecomps2 not
            specified). Allows nodes occurring slightly above or below the
            separation to be grouped properly. The following expression
            represents the default value:

        Notes
        -----
        CZMESH is used on a mesh with shared nodes at the interface.

        If ecomps1 and ecomps2 are specified, the CZMESH command creates/meshes
        interface elements (INTER202, INTER203, INTER204, INTER205) along the
        boundary between the two components or groups of elements.

        The elements in each of the components or groups of elements will share
        nodes with each other and also with the interface elements. This one-
        element thick boundary of interface elements will split the body
        between the two components or groups of elements.

        Subsequent separation (delamination and failure) of the interface zone
        will result in an increasing displacement between the nodes (within the
        interface element) along the cohesive zone elements. Unless otherwise
        specified, the CZMESH command analyzes the configuration and geometry
        of the adjacent structural elements and provides the appropriate
        interface element.

        The CZMESH operation copies any nodal temperatures you have defined on
        the split surface of the original mesh from the original nodes to the
        newly created coincident duplicate nodes. However, displacements,
        forces, and other boundary conditions are not copied.

        The CZMESH command is valid for structural analyses only.

        is similar to PENCHK on the EDCONTACT command. However, EDSP controls
        penetration checking for individual contact entities whereas PENCHK is

        kb, ke
            Beginning and ending orientation keypoints to be associated with
            selected, unmeshed lines.  ANSYS uses the location of these
            keypoints to determine how to orient beam cross sections during
            beam meshing.  Beam elements may be created along a line with a
            constant orientation by specifying only one orientation keypoint
            (KB), or a pre-twisted beam may be created by selecting different
            orientation keypoints at each end of the line (KB and KE).  (For a
            line bounded by two keypoints (KP1 and KP2), the orientation vector
            at the beginning of the line extends from KP1 to KB, and the
            orientation vector at the end of the line extends from KP2 to KE.
            The orientation vectors are used to compute the orientation nodes
            of the elements.)

        secnum
            Section identifier to be associated with selected, unmeshed lines.
            For details, see the description of the SECTYPE and SECNUM
            commands.

        Notes
        -----
        The element attributes specified by the LATT command will be used when
        the lines are meshed.

        Lines subsequently generated from the lines will also have the
        attributes specified by MAT, REAL, TYPE, and SECNUM.  If a line does
        not have these attributes associated with it (by this command) at the
        time it is meshed, the attributes are obtained from the then current
        MAT, REAL, TYPE, and SECNUM command settings.

        In contrast, the values specified by KB and KE apply only to the
        selected lines; that is, lines subsequently generated from these lines
        will not share these attributes.  Similarly, if a line does not have KB
        and KE attributes associated with it via the LATT command at the time
        it is meshed, ANSYS cannot obtain the attributes from elsewhere.  See
        the discussion on beam meshing in Meshing Your Solid Model in the
        Modeling and Meshing Guide for more information.

        Reissue the LATT command (before lines are meshed) to change the
        attributes.  A zero (or blank) argument removes the corresponding
        association. If any of the arguments are defined as -1, then that value
        will be left unchanged in the selected set.

        In some cases, ANSYS can proceed with a line meshing operation even
        when no logical element type has been assigned via LATT,,,TYPE or TYPE.

            (blank) - The DOF is not locked (default).

            FIXED - Displacement on the specified degrees of freedom (Lab) is locked. The program
                    prescribes the degree of freedom to the “current” relative
                    displacement value in addition to deleting the force. If a
                    displacement constraint (for example, D command) is applied
                    in conjunction with this option, the actual applied

        Use this command to define inertia properties for a rigid body that is
        created when a deformable part is switched to rigid (using the EDRD,D2R
        command) in an explicit dynamic analysis. If these properties are not
        defined, LS-DYNA will compute the new rigid body properties from the
        finite element mesh (which requires an accurate mesh representation of
        the body). When rigid bodies are merged to a master rigid body, the
        inertia properties defined for the master rigid body apply to all
        members of the merged set.

        EDRI can only be issued in a new analysis. Therefore, if you are going

        dtmin

        Notes
        -----
        This command specifies time step sizes for an ANSYS Multi-field solver
        analysis. If either DTMIN or DTMAX is not equal to DTIME, auto time-
        stepping is turned on for the multi-field loop. ANSYS will
        automatically adjust the time step size for the next multi-field step
        between DTMIN and DTMAX, based on the status of the current
        convergence, the number of target stagger iterations (specified by
        MFITER), and the actual number of iterations needed to reach
        convergence at the current time step.

        If auto time-stepping is turned off, the time step size must be evenly
        divisible into the end time (specified by MFTIME) minus the start time
        (0 for a new analysis or a restart time specified by MFRSTART).

        You can use a smaller time step within each ANSYS field analysis. This
        is called subcycling. Use the DELTIM and AUTOTS commands to subcycle a

        Notes
        -----
        The OCREAD command imports ocean data that has been defined externally

        The command operates on the ocean load ID specified via the most
        recently issued OCTYPE command. Issue a separate OCREAD command for
        each ocean load that you want to read into the program.

        Fname is limited to 248 characters, including the directory path. If
        Fname does not include a directory path, the program searches for the
        specified file in the current working directory. An unspecified Fname
        defaults to Jobname.

        For the diffracted wave type (KWAVE = 8 on the OCDATA command), you

            be included under the same label. Up to 200 different labels may be
            defined. The following labels are predefined and are not available
            for user-defined labels:  REFL, STAT, and ERAS.  Lab = REFL refills
            all tables previously defined with the ETABLE commands (not the
            CALC module commands) according to the latest ETABLE specifications
            and is convenient for refilling tables after the load step (SET)
            has been changed. Remaining fields will be ignored if Lab is REFL.
            Lab = STAT displays stored table values.  Lab = ERAS erases the
            entire table.

        item
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in the
            table below. Some items also require a component label. Character
            parameters may be used. Item = ERAS erases a Lab column.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are
            shown in the table below. Character parameters may be used.

        option
            Option for storing element table data:

            MIN - Store minimum element nodal value of the specified item component.

            MAX - Store maximum element nodal value of the specified item component.

            AVG - Store averaged element centroid value of the specified item component
                  (default).

        Notes
        -----
        The ETABLE command defines a table of values per element (the element
        table) for use in further processing. The element table is organized
        similar to spreadsheet, with rows representing all selected elements
        and columns consisting of result items which have been moved into the
        table (Item,Comp) via ETABLE. Each column of data is identified by a
        user-defined label (Lab) for listings and displays.

        After entering the data into the element table, you are not limited to
        merely listing or displaying your data (PLESOL, PRESOL, etc.). You may
        also perform many types of operations on your data, such as adding or
        multiplying columns (SADD, SMULT), defining allowable stresses for
        safety calculations (SALLOW), or multiplying one column by another
        (SMULT).  See Getting Started in theBasic Analysis Guide for more
        information.

        Various results data can be stored in the element table. For example,
        many items for an element are inherently single-valued (one value per
        element). The single-valued items include: SERR, SDSG, TERR, TDSG,
        SENE, SEDN, TENE, KENE, AENE, JHEAT, JS, VOLU, and CENT. All other
        items are multivalued (varying over the element, such that there is a
        different value at each node). Because only one value is stored in the
        element table per element, an average value (based on the number of
        contributing nodes) is calculated for multivalued items. Exceptions to
        this averaging procedure are FMAG and all element force items, which
        represent the sum only of the contributing nodal values.

        Two methods of data access can be used with the ETABLE command. The
        method you select depends upon the type of data that you want to store.
        Some results can be accessed via a generic label (Component Name
        method), while others require a label and number (Sequence Number
        method).

        The Component Name method is used to access the General element data
        (that is, element data which is generally available to most element
        types or groups of element types). All of the single-valued items and
        some of the more general multivalued items are accessible with the
        Component Name method.  Various element results depend on the
        calculation method and the selected results location (AVPRIN, RSYS,
        LAYER, SHELL, and ESEL).

        Although nodal data is readily available for listings and displays
        (PRNSOL, PLNSOL) without using the element table, you may also use the
        Component Name method to enter these results into the element table for
        further "worksheet" manipulation. (See Getting Started in theBasic
        Analysis Guide for more information.) A listing of the General Item and
        Comp labels for the Component Name method is shown below.

        The Sequence Number method allows you to view results for data that is
        not averaged (such as pressures at nodes, temperatures at integration
        points, etc.), or data that is not easily described in a generic
        fashion (such as all derived data for structural line elements and
        contact elements, all derived data for thermal line elements, layer
        data for layered elements, etc.). A table illustrating the Items (such
        as LS, LEPEL, LEPTH, SMISC, NMISC, SURF, etc.) and corresponding
        sequence numbers for each element is shown in the Output Data section
        of each element description found in the Element Reference.

        Some element table data are reported in the results coordinate system.
        These include all component results (for example, UX, UY, etc.; SX, SY,
        etc.). The solution writes component results in the database and on the
        results file in the solution coordinate system. When you issue the
        ETABLE command, these results are then transformed into the results
        coordinate system (RSYS) before being stored in the element table. The
        default results coordinate system is global Cartesian (RSYS,0).  All
        other data are retrieved from the database and stored in the element
        table with no coordinate transformation.

        Use the PRETAB, PLETAB, or ETABLE,STAT commands to display the stored
        table values. Issue ETABLE,ERAS to erase the entire table. Issue
        ETABLE,Lab,ERAS to erase a Lab column.

        When the GUI is on, if a Delete operation in a Define Element Table
        Data dialog box writes this command to a log file (Jobname.LOG or
        Jobname.LGW), you will observe that Lab is blank, Item = ERASE, and
        Comp is an integer number. In this case, the GUI has assigned a value
        of Comp that corresponds to the location of a chosen variable name in
        the dialog box's list. It is not intended that you type in such a
        location value for Comp in a session.  However, a file that contains a
        GUI-generated ETABLE command of this form can be used for batch input
        or for use with the /INPUT command.

        The element table data option (Option) is not available for all output
        items. See the table below for supported items.

        area
            The area number containing the selected lines. The normal of the

            lowest numbered selected area containing the line number.

        ndir
            Direction of the normal. If NDIR = -1, the nodal coordinate system

        The NORL command rotates the X-axis of the nodal coordinate
        perpendicular to the line normal. The rotated nodal coordinate systems
        may be displayed through the /PSYMB command. In case multiple lines are
        selected, there could be conflicts at the boundaries. If a node belongs
        to two lines that have a different normal, its nodal coordinate system

        For selections based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results,
        etc.), items that are within the range VMIN -Toler and VMAX + Toler are
        selected. The default tolerance Toler is based on the relative values
        of VMIN and VMAX as follows:

        If VMIN = VMAX, Toler = 0.005 x VMIN.

        If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, Toler = 1.0E-6.

            BBOX - Bounding box mode. For PowerGraphics plots involving elements with /SHOW,x11
                   and /SHOW,win32, ANSYS generally displays dynamic rotations
                   faster. If KEY = 1 (ON), then a bounding box (not the
                   elements) encompassing the model is displayed and rotated,
                   rather than the element outlines (ON is default in
                   preprocessing). When KEY = 0 (OFF), then dynamic rotations
                   may be slower (ANSYS redraws the element outlines) for plots
                   involving elements with /SHOW,x11 and /SHOW,win32.  OFF is
                   default in postprocessing. This command is ignored if
                   /EDGE,WN,1 is set for any WN. This is ignored in POST1 and
                   SOLUTION plots.

            For any PowerGraphics plots involving elements, regardless of /SHOW settings, plots will generally be displayed faster. - VECTOR

            Vector mode. In vector mode, areas, volumes, elements, and postprocessing display geometries are shown as outlines (wireframes).  When vector mode is off (default), these entities are shown filled with color. - DITHER

            When dithering is turned on (default), color intensity transitions are smoothed.  This selection a - applies only to smooth-shaded images, i.e., Z-buffered [/TYPE], or raster plots
                              with Gouraud or Phong shading [/SHADE].

            ANIM - Select the animation type used on 2-D devices on the PC platform. A KEY value
                   of BMP (or 0) sets animation mode to ANSYS Animation
                   Controller (default). A KEY value of AVI (or 2) sets
                   animation mode to AVI movie player file.

            FONT - Font selection for the ANSYS graphics window. When Label = FONT, the command
                   format is: /DEVICE,FONT,KEY,Val1,Val2,Val3,Val4,Val5,Val6
                   where KEY determines the type of font being controlled, and
                   values 1 through 6 control various font parameters. Note
                   that these values are device specific; using the same
                   command input file [/INPUT] on different machines may yield
                   different results.. The following KEY values determine the
                   font information that will be supplied to the appropriate
                   driver (e.g., Postscript, X11, Win32, JPEG, ...):

            KEY = 1 - The command controls the LEGEND (documentation column) font.

            KEY = 2 - The command controls the ENTITY (node and keypoint number) font.

            KEY = 3 - The command controls the ANNOTATION/GRAPH font.

            Linux: Values 1 through 4 are used to find a match in the X11 database of font strings. Values 1, 2, and 3 are character strings; value 4 is a nonzero integer:    - Val1

            Family name (e.g., Courier). If Val1 = MENU, all other values are ignored and a font selection menu appears (GUI must be active). - Val2

            Weight (e.g., medium) - Val3

            Slant (e.g., r) - Val4

            Pixel size (e.g., 14). Note that this value does no affect the annotation fonts (KEY = 3). Use the /TSPEC command for annotation font size.  - Val5

            unused - Val6

            unused - PC: The values are encoded in a PC logical font structure.  Value 1 is a
                     character string, and the remaining values are integers:

            Val1 - Family name (e.g., Courier*New) Substitute an asterisk (*) for any blank
                   character that appears in a family name. If Val1 = MENU, all
                   other values are ignored and a font selection menu appears
                   (GUI must be active). When this value is blank ANSYS uses
                   the first available resource it finds.

            Val2 - Weight (0 - 1000)

            Val3 - Orientation (in tenths of a degree)

                   text size is precisely the default size.  If PERCENT = 200,
                   the new text size is twice the default text size.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shellip
            Number of shell integration points used for output (defaults to 3).
            For element SHELL163, each integration point is associated with a
            layer. SHELLIP must be  3. If SHELLIP = 3, results are written for
            the shell top, middle, and bottom. If SHELLIP >3, then the results
            for the first SHELLIP layers are written.

        beamip
            Number of beam integration points used for stress output for
            BEAM161 (defaults to 4).

        Notes
        -----
        The number of integration points is defined by the element real
        constant NIP for both the beam elements (in the cross section) and the
        shell elements (through the thickness).

        For shell elements that have only 1 or 2 integration points (NIP = 1 or
        2), use the default of SHELLIP = 3. If NIP = 1, the same results are
        reported at the top, middle, and bottom layers.  If the NIP = 2, the
        results at the bottom correspond to integration point 1, the results at
        the top correspond to integration point 2, and the results at the
        middle are an average of the top and bottom results.

        For shell elements with 2 x 2 integration points in the plane, the data
        from the four points are averaged, and there is a single output value
        for each layer.

        If you set BEAMIP = 0, no stress output is written for BEAM161
        elements. In this case, the beams will not appear in any POST1 plots

        Fit a response surface for an output parameter in a solution set.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rslab
            Response surface set label. Identifies the response surface results
            for later postprocessing. This label can be used as Rlab for
            postprocessing response surface results, and for evaluating the fit
            results with RSPLOT and RSPRNT. You must have separate
            identification labels for the solution sets and for the response
            surface sets, because you can perform a response surface fit based
            on Monte Carlo results. For this case, the original Monte Carlo
            results are identified by the solution set label provided in the
            PDEXE command and the results generated with the fitted response
            surfaces are identified by the response surface set label (RSlab)
            provided here. RSlab must not contain blanks. Maximum length of
            this field is 16 characters; if this field contains more than 16
            characters, it will be truncated to 16 characters.

        slab
            Solution set label that identifies the probabilistic analysis
            containing the results to be fitted. This solution set label is
            defined with the PDEXE command.

        name
            Parameter name. The parameter must have been previously defined as
            a random output parameter with the PDVAR command. The result values
            of this parameter (stored in the solution set identified by Slab)
            are fitted as a function of all random input variables.

        rmod
            Regression model to use for the evaluation of the response surface.

            LIN - Regression model with linear terms only.

            QUAD - Regression model with linear and pure quadratic terms (no cross-terms).

            QUAX - Regression model with linear and all quadratic terms (including cross-terms).
                   (Default.)

        ytrans
            Option for the transformation type applied to the output parameter
            identified with Name.

            NONE - The values of the output parameter Name are not transformed (default).

            EXP - The values of the output parameter Name are transformed according to Y* =
                  exp(Y). The transformed values Y* are used for the fitting
                  process.

            LOGA - The values of the output parameter Name are transformed according to Y* =
                   loga(Y), where the basis a is specified by Yval. The
                   transformed values Y* are used for the fitting process.

        yval
            Value needed for Ytrans = LOGA, Ytrans = POW, and Ytrans = BOX.
            Ignored for all other options of Ytrans. For Ytrans = LOGA and
            Ytrans = POW, the default value is Yval = 1.0. For Ytrans = BOX,
            the default value is Yval = 0.01.

        xfilt
            Option that specifies if irrelevant terms of the regression model
            should be filtered out.

            NONE - Regression term filtering is not done. A full regression model as specified
                   with the Rmod option is evaluated.

            FSR - Use the "forward-stepwise-regression" to automatically filter out individual
                  and irrelevant terms of the regression model. If irrelevant
                  terms are sorted out this leads to a smaller number of
                  coefficients to be determined in the regression analysis,
                  which then leads to increased accuracy of the coefficients of
                  the remaining terms in the regression model (default).

        conf
            Confidence level that is used to filter the terms of the regression
            model if the Xfilt = FSR option has been selected. The value of
            CONF must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (default is 0.95). The higher this
            value, the more terms will be filtered out. Consequently, higher
            CONF values lead to a fewer terms in the regression model.
            Likewise, lower CONF values lead to more terms being included in
            the regression model.

        Notes
        -----
        Evaluates a response surface for a random output parameter Name. The

        only one response surface set for each solution set. A response surface

        set for which Monte Carlo simulations have already been generated using
        the RSSIMS command then these Monte Carlo samples are deleted by the

        nsim
            Number of simulation loops per repetition cycle.

        nrep
            Number of repetition cycles of the analysis.

        isopt
            Latin-Hypercube sampling divides the domain of each random input
            variable into intervals of equal probability. The interval sampling
            option ISopt determines where the samples are located within each
            interval.

            RAND - Picks a random location within the interval (default).

            MEAN - Picks the mean value location within the interval.

            MEDI - Picks the median value location within the interval.

        --
            Unused field.

        astop
            Autostop option label.

            AUTO - Enable Autostop. When Autostop is used, the PDS feature continues the
                   simulation loops until the convergence criteria for the mean
                   value and the standard deviation have been met or until the
                   number of simulations NSIM are complete, whichever comes
                   first. The convergence criteria (mean value and standard
                   deviations of all random output parameters) are specified by
                   the ACCMEAN and ACCSTDEV parameters. The criteria are met if
                   the mean value and the standard deviations converge within
                   the accuracy specified in the ACCMEAN and ACCSTDEV options.
                   The convergence check is done every i-th loop, where i is
                   specified in the CHECK parameter.

            ALL - Disable Autostop option. All Monte Carlo Simulations as specified by NSIM and
                  NREP are performed (default).

        accmean
            Accuracy of the mean values of all random output parameters that
            must be met to activate Autostop. Default is 0.01 (1%). ACCMEAN is
            ignored for Astop = ALL. The convergence for the mean values is met
            if for all random output parameters y the following equation is
            true:

        accstdev
            Accuracy of the standard deviations of all random output parameters
            that must be met to activate Autostop. The default is 0.02 (2%).
            ACCSTDEV is ignored for Astop = ALL. The convergence for the
            standard deviations is met if for all random output parameters y
            the following equation is true:

        check
            Sets how often conditions for convergence are checked for Autostop.
            The PDS feature checks if the convergence criteria are met every
            i-th loop, where i is given by the CHECK parameter. The default
            value is 10. It not recommended to use CHECK = 1, because it could
            cause Autostop to terminate the simulations prematurely. The mean
            values and standard deviation might not show large differences
            between all simulation loops but might still have a visible
            "global" trend if viewed over several simulations. This behavior
            indicates that convergence has not really been achieved. If you set
            CHECK = 1, then Autostop is not able to detect such a global trend.
            CHECK is ignored for Astop = ALL.

        seed
            Seed value label. Random number generators require a seed value
            that is used to calculate the next random number. After each random
            number generation finishes, the seed value is updated and is used
            again to calculate the next random number. ANSYS initializes the
            seed value with the system time when the ANSYS session started.

            CONT - Continues updating using the derived seed value (default).

            TIME - Initializes the seed value with the system time. You can use this if you want
                   the seed value set to a specific value for one analysis and
                   then you want to continue with a "random" seed in the next
                   analysis. It is not recommended to "randomize" the seed
                   value with the Seed = TIME option for multiple analyses. If
                   the Monte Carlo simulations requested with this command will
                   be appended to previously existing simulations, then the
                   Seed option is ignored and Seed = CONT is used.

            INIT - Initializes the seed value using 123457 (a typical recommendation). This option
                   leads to identical random numbers for all random input
                   variables when the exact analysis will be repeated, making
                   it useful for benchmarking and validation purposes (where
                   identical random numbers are desired). If the Monte Carlo
                   simulations requested with this command will be appended to
                   previously existing simulations, then the Seed option is
                   ignored and Seed = CONT is used.

            Value - Uses the specified (positive) value for the initialization of the seed value.
                    This option has the same effect as Seed = INIT, except you
                    can chose an arbitrary (positive) number for the
                    initialization. If the Monte Carlo simulations requested
                    with this command will be appended to previously existing
                    simulations, then the Seed option is ignored and Seed =
                    CONT is used.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines the number of simulations per repetition cycle, number of
        repetition cycles, specification of the Autostop option, checking
        frequency for the Autostop option, and the seed value for random number
        generation.

        For Latin-Hypercube sampling, it is advantageous to divide the total
        number of requested simulations into a few repetitions. This adds more
        randomness to the sampling process. If NTOT is the total number of
        simulations, then as a rough rule of thumb NTOT should be NREP =
        repetitions. The number obtained with this rule of thumb must be
        adjusted such that NTOT = NREP*NSIM. For example if NTOT = 1000 then
        NREP =  = 10, so the 1000 simulations can be done in 100 simulations
        with 10 repetitions. If for example NTOT = 100 then NREP =  = 3.16,
        which means that the 100 simulations could be broken up into either
        2*50 or 4*25 simulations.

        If Autostop is enabled then the maximum number of simulations to be
        performed is given by NSIM*NREP. The Autostop option will terminate the
        simulations before the NSIM*NREP simulations are done if the
        convergence criteria are met.

        Notes
        -----
        Selecting by component is a convenient adjunct to individual item
        selection (e.g., VSEL, ESEL, etc.). CMSEL, ALL allows you to select
        components in addition to other items you have already selected.

        If Type = R for an assembly selection [CMSEL,R,<assembly-name>], the
        reselect operation is performed on each component in the assembly in
        the order in which the components make up the assembly.  Thus, if one
        reselect operation results in an empty set, subsequent operations will
        also result in empty sets.  For example, if the first reselect
        operation tries to reselect node 1 from the selected set of nodes 3, 4,
        and 5, the operation results in an empty set (that is, no nodes are
        selected).  Since the current set is now an empty set, if the second
        reselect operation tries to reselect any nodes, the second operation
        also results in an empty set, and so on.  This is equivalent to
        repeating the command CMSEL,R,<component-name> once for each component
        making up the assembly.

        value
            Degree-of-freedom value or table name reference for tabular
            boundary conditions.  To specify a table, enclose the table name in
            percent (%) signs (for example, D,Node,TEMP,%tabname%). Use the

            the degree of freedom allow a complex input, Value (above) is the
            real component and VALUE2 is the imaginary component.

        nend, ninc
            Specifies the same values of constraint at the range of nodes from
            Node to NEND (defaults to Node), in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).

        lab2, lab3, lab4, lab5, lab6
            Additional degree-of-freedom labels. The same values are applied to
            the nodes for these labels.

        Notes
        -----
        The available degrees of freedom per node are listed under "Degrees of
        Freedom" in the input table for each element type in the Element
        Reference.  Degrees of freedom are defined in the nodal coordinate
        system.  The positive directions of structural translations and
        rotations are along and about the positive nodal axes directions.
        Structural rotations should be input in radians.  The node and the
        degree-of-freedom label must be selected (NSEL, DOFSEL).

        In a structural analysis, you can apply only one displacement,
        velocity, or acceleration load at any degree of freedom. If multiple
        loads are specified, the last applied load overrides the previous ones.
        For example, the following commands apply loads to node 100:

        In this case, the velocity load (VELX) applied in the last command will
        override the displacement load (UX).

        For elements used in static and low frequency electromagnetic analysis
        (SOLID236 and SOLID237), the AZ degree of freedom is not a z-component
        of a vector potential, but rather the flux contribution on the element
        edge.  To specify a flux-parallel condition, set AZ = 0.  For more
        information, see 3-D Magnetostatics and Fundamentals of Edge-based
        Analysis in the Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Analysis Guide.

        In an explicit dynamic analysis, the D command can only be used to fix
        nodes in the model. The degree-of-freedom value must be zero; no other
        values are valid. Use the EDLOAD command to apply a nonzero
        displacement in an explicit dynamic analysis.

        For ELBOW290 cross-section degrees of freedom (Lab = SE, SO, SW, SRA,
        SRT, or SECT), the D command can only specify fixed constraints. The
        degree-of-freedom value must be zero; no other values are valid.

        For hydrostatic fluid elements (HSFLD241 and HSFLD242), the HDSP
        degree-of-freedom constraint at the pressure node prescribes the
        pressure value for all the fluid elements sharing the pressure node.

        Tabular boundary conditions (VALUE = %tabname%) are available only for
        the following degree-of-freedom labels: Electric (VOLT), structural
        (UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ, and velocity and acceleration loads
        VELX, VELY, VELZ, OMGX, OMGY, OMGZ, ACCX, ACCY, ACCZ, DMGX, DMGY,
        DMGZ), acoustic (PRES, UX, UY, UZ,), and temperature (TEMP, TBOT, TE2,
        TE3, . . ., TTOP). All labels are valid only in static (ANTYPE,STATIC)
        and full transient (ANTYPE,TRANS) analyses.

        %_FIX% is an ANSYS reserved table name. When VALUE is set to %_FIX%,
        ANSYS will prescribe the degree of freedom to the “current” relative
        displacement value. This option is only valid for the following labels:
        UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ. Alternatively, functions UX(), UY(), etc.
        may be used (see *GET for a complete list of available functions). In
        most cases, %_FIX% usage is efficient and recommended for all
        structural degrees of freedom.

        When Value = SUPPORT, specify only the minimum number of displacement
        constraints necessary to prevent rigid body motion: three constraints
        (or fewer, depending on the element type) for 2-D models and six (or
        fewer) for 3-D models.

        If constraints and initial conditions (IC) are applied at the same
        node, the constraint specification overrides. This combination is
        useful when a constraint degree-of-freedom value needs to start with a
        nonzero value at time = 0.0. For example, if the constraint degree-of-
        freedom value is prescribed to be a cosine function, then specifying an
        initial condition for the same node and degree of freedom ensures that
        the initial value for the constraint degree of freedom at time = 0.0 is
        same as the cosine function evaluated at time = 0.0. If initial
        conditions are not specified, the constraint degree-of-freedom value
        ramps from zero in the first substep of the first loadstep.

        If more than one rotational degrees of freedom are constrained with
        non-zero rotations (ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ), rotational velocities (OMGX,
        OMGY, OMGZ), or rotational accelerations (DMGX, DMGY, DMGZ), then the
        rotation of the constrained node from its initial configuration to its
        final configuration depends on the combination and the sequence in
        which the constraints are applied. See Rotations in a Large-Deflection
        Analysis in Structural Analysis Guide.

        Notes
        -----
        When adaptive meshing (adaptivity) is turned on, the mesh will

        Adaptive meshing is most commonly used in the analysis of large
        deformation processes such as metal forming, in which the blank would
        need to be adaptively meshed.

        Adaptive meshing is only valid for parts consisting of SHELL163
        elements. By default, adaptive meshing is OFF for all parts in the

            to the initial Jobname as specified on the ANSYS execution command,
            or to file if none specified.

        key
            Specify whether to use the existing log, error, lock, page, and
            output files (.LOG, .ERR, .LOCK, .PAGE and .OUT) or start new
            files.

            0, OFF - Continue using current log, error, lock, page, and output files.

            1, ON - Start new log, error, lock, page, and output files (old log and error files are
                    closed and saved, but old lock, page, and output files are
                    deleted). Existing log and error files are appended.

        Notes
        -----
        All subsequently created files will be named with this Jobname if Key =
        0.  Use Key = 1 to start new log, error, lock, page, and output files.
        The previous Jobname is typically defined on the ANSYS program
        execution line (see the Operations Guide).  This command is useful when
        different groups of files created throughout the run are to have
        different names.  For example, the command may be used before each
        substructure pass to avoid overwriting files or having to rename each
        file individually.

        This command is valid only at the Begin level.

        fluxtol
            Convergence tolerance for radiation flux. Defaults to 0.0001. This
            value is a relative tolerance.

        solver
            Choice of solver for radiosity calculation:

        maxfluxiter
            Maximum number of flux iterations to be performed according to the
            specified solver type:

            0 - If the FULL solver is specified (THOPT,FULL), convergence criteria are
                monitored and iterations are performed until convergence
                occurs. If the QUASI solver is specified (THOPT,QUASI),

        Notes
        -----
        The radiation heat flux is linearized, resulting in robust convergence.

        The radiation flux norm for FLUXTOL is expressed as:

        where i is the pass or iteration number and j is the surface facet for
        radiation.

        For a sufficiently small absolute tolerance value, relative tolerance
        converges in fewer iterations than absolute tolerance. For a
        sufficiently large absolute tolerance value, relative tolerance may
        cause convergence difficulties.

        ----------
        kywrd
            Specifies various TIFF file export options.

            COMP - If Kywrd = COMP, then OPT controls data compression for the output file. If

            COLOR - If Kywrd = COLOR, then OPT will determine the color attribute of the saved
                    file. OPT can be 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to Black and
                    White, Grayscale, and Color (default), respectively.

            TMOD - If Kywrd = TMOD, then OPT will determine the text method. OPT can be either 1
                   or 0, corresponding to bitmap text (default) or line stroke
                   text, respectively.

            DEFAULT - If Kywrd = DEFAULT, then all of the default values, for all of the Kywrd
                      parameters listed above, are active.

        opt
            OPT can have the following names or values, depending on the value

        Parameters
        ----------
        vpath
            Path name for a predefined path [PATH command] for calculating the
            EMF (voltage drop) from the conductor to a reference point. The
            path should start at the outer conductor wall and end at a
            reference voltage point.

        ipath
            Path name for a predefined path [PATH command] for calculating the
            MMF (current) in a conductor. The path should traverse a closed
            contour surrounding the conductor, and you should define the path
            in a counterclockwise direction.

        vsymm
            Symmetry factor applied to the calculated EMF (voltage drop). The
            EMF (voltage drop) from the conductor to the reference point is
            multiplied by Vsymm.

        isymm
            Symmetry factor applied to the calculated current. The calculated
            current is multiplied by Isymm.

        Notes
        -----
        Used in a harmonic high-frequency electromagnetic analysis, IMPD
        calculates the impedance of a conductor at a reference plane from the
        EMF (voltage) and MMF (current) at the reference plane. The EMF
        (voltage drop) is calculated by a line integral from the input path
        name (specified by the Vpath argument) that extends from the conductor
        to a reference point. The MMF (current) is calculated by a closed path
        around the conductor from the input path name (specified with Ipath).
        In cases having modeled symmetry, you can multiply the voltage drop or
        current by symmetry factors (Vsymm and Isymm respectively).

        This command macro returns the scalar parameters Zre and Zim,
        representing the real and imaginary components of the impedance.

        lab

            Reference.

        vali, valj

            keypoint (VALJ) of the line, or table name for specifying tabular
            boundary conditions.  If VALJ is blank, it defaults to VALI.  If

            film coefficients and VAL2I and VAL2J are the bulk temperatures.
            To specify a table, enclose the table name in percent signs (%),
            e.g., %tabname%.  Use the *DIM command to define a table.  If Lab =
            CONV and VALI = -N, the film coefficient may be a function of
            temperature and is determined from the HF property table for
            material N [MP].  If Lab = RAD, VALI and VALJ values are surface
            emissivities and VAL2I and VAL2J are ambient temperatures.  The
            temperature used to evaluate the film coefficient is usually the
            average between the bulk and wall temperatures, but may be user
            defined for some elements.  If Lab = RDSF, VALI is the emissivity
            value; the following condition apply: If VALI = -N, the emissivity
            may be a function of the temperature and is determined from the
            EMISS property table for material N [MP]. If Lab = FSIN in a Multi-
            field solver (single or multiple code coupling) analysis, VALI is
            the surface interface number. If Lab = FSIN in a unidirectional

        val2i, val2j
            Second surface load values (if any).  If Lab = CONV, VAL2I and
            VAL2J are the bulk temperatures. If Lab = RAD, VAL2I and VAL2J are
            the ambient temperatures. If Lab = RDSF, VAL2I is the enclosure

            enclosure numbers. If the enclosure is open, radiation will occur
            to the ambient. VAL2I and VAL2J are not used for other surface load
            labels.  If VAL2J is blank, it defaults to VAL2I.  If VAL2J is

        ----------
        lab
            Controls the degree of tessellation used in the calculation of area
            properties.  If LAB = DEFAULT, area calculations will use the
            degree of tessellation set through the /FACET command.  If LAB =

        Calculates and prints geometry statistics (volume, centroid location,
        moments of inertia, etc.) associated with the selected volumes.
        Geometry items are reported in the global Cartesian coordinate system.
        A unit density is assumed unless the volumes have a material
        association via the VATT command.  Items calculated by VSUM and later
        retrieved by a *GET or *VGET command are valid only if the model is not
        modified after the VSUM command is issued.

        Setting a finer degree of tessellation will provide area calculations
        with greater accuracy, especially for thin, hollow models.  However,
        using a finer degree of tessellation requires longer processing.

        For very thin volumes, such that the ratio of the minimum to the
        maximum dimension is less than 0.01, the VSUM command can provide
        erroneous volume information.  To ensure that such calculations are
        accurate, make certain that you subdivide such volumes so that the
        ratio of the minimum to the maximum is at least 0.05.

        option
             Plotting option (default = 1).

            1 - Plots the elements with the smallest time step sizes. The number of elements
                plotted and listed is equal to VALUE1 (which defaults to 100).
                Each element is shaded red or yellow based on its time step

            2 - Produces the same plot as for OPTION = 1, and also produces a list of the
                plotted elements and their corresponding time step values.

            3 - Produces a plot similar to OPTION = 1, except that all selected elements are
                plotted. Elements beyond the first VALUE1 elements are blue and
                translucent. The amount of translucency is specified by VALUE2.
                This option also produces a list of the first VALUE1 elements
                with their corresponding time step values.

        value1
            Number of elements to be plotted and listed (default = 100). For
            example, if VALUE1 = 10, only the elements with the 10 smallest
            time step sizes are plotted and listed.

        value2
            Translucency level ranging from 0 to 1 (default = 0.9). VALUE2 is
            only used when OPTION = 3, and only for the elements plotted in
            blue. To plot these elements as non-translucent, set VALUE2 = 0.

        Notes
        -----
        EDTP invokes an ANSYS macro that plots and lists explicit elements
        based on their time step size. For OPTION = 1 or 2, the number of
        elements plotted is equal to VALUE1 (default = 100). For OPTION = 3,
        all selected elements are plotted.

        The elements are shaded red, yellow, or blue based on their time step
        size. Red represents the smallest time step sizes, yellow represents
        the intermediate time step sizes, and blue represents the largest time
        step sizes. For example, if you specify VALUE1 = 30, and if T1 is the
        smallest critical time step of all elements and T30 is the time step of
        the 30th smallest element, then the elements are shaded as follows:

        val
            Maximum desired displacement (absolute value).  Valid only if Lab =

        node
            Node number corresponding to displacement used to compare with

            List of keypoints defining the area (18 maximum if using keyboard

        Keypoints (P1 through P18) must be input in a clockwise or
        counterclockwise order around the area.  This order also determines the
        positive normal direction of the area according to the right-hand rule.
        Existing lines between adjacent keypoints will be used; missing lines
        are generated "straight" in the active coordinate system and assigned
        the lowest available numbers [NUMSTR].  If more than one line exists
        between two keypoints, the shorter one will be chosen.  If the area is
        to be defined with more than four keypoints, the required keypoints and
        lines must lie on a constant coordinate value in the active coordinate
        system (such as a plane or a cylinder).  Areas may be redefined only if
        not yet attached to a volume.  Solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Type of entity on which the hard point will be created.

            LINE - Hard point will be created on a line.

            AREA - Hard point will be created within an area (not on the boundaries).

        entity
            Number of the line or area on which the hard point will be created.

        nhp
            Number assigned to the hard point.  Defaults to the lowest
            available hard point number.

        label
            If LABEL = COORD, VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3 are the respective global X,
            Y, and Z coordinates.  If LABEL = RATIO, VAL1 is the parameter
            value (this is available only for lines).  Valid parameter values
            are between 0 and 1.  VAL2 and VAL3 are ignored.

        val1
            If LABEL = RATIO, ratio value for line.  If LABEL = COORD, global X
            coordinate value.

        val2
            If LABEL = COORD, global Y coordinate value.

        val3
            If LABEL = COORD, global Z coordinate value.

        Notes
        -----
        The ability to enter a parameter value provides a simple way of
        positioning hard points on lines.  For example, to place a hard point
        halfway along a line, one can simply specify a VAL1 value of 0.5.

        For models imported through the DEFAULT IGES filter, you can place hard
        points on models only by specifying coordinates (you can't place a hard
        point using interactive picking).

        If you issue any commands that update the geometry of an entity, such
        as Boolean or simplification commands, any hard points associated with
        that entity are deleted.  Therefore, you should add any hard points
        after completing the solid model.  If you delete an entity that has
        associated hard points, those hard points are either

        Deleted along with the entity (if the hard point is not associated with
        any other entities).

        Detached from the deleted entity (if the hard point is associated with
        additional entities).

        When archiving your model (CDWRITE), hardpoint information cannot be
        written to the IGES file. The Jobname.cdb file can be written with the
        CDWRITE,DB option.

        Hard points are only applicable for area and volume meshing, not for

        Notes
        -----
        Defines the reference temperature for the thermal strain calculations
        in structural analyses and explicit dynamic analyses.  Thermal strains
        are given by : α *(T-TREF), where α is the coefficient of thermal
        expansion (for more on this see the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference).
        Input the strain via ALPX, ALPY, ALPZ (the secant or mean coefficient
        value), or CTEX, CTEY, CTEZ (the instantaneous coefficient value), or
        the thermal strain value (THSX, THSY, THSZ). T is the element
        temperature. If α is temperature-dependent, TREF should be in the range
        of temperatures you define using the MPTEMP command.

            Unused field.

        fname2
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including
            directory) to which cut-boundary D commands are written. If no
            specified directory path exists, the path defaults to your working

        ext2
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        kpos
            Position on Fname2 to write block of D commands:

            0 - Beginning of file (overwrite existing file).

            1 - End of file (append to existing file).

        clab
            Label (eight characters maximum, including the colon) for this
            block of D commands on Fname2.  his label is appended to the colon
            (:).  Defaults to CBn, where n is the cumulative iteration number
            for the data set currently in the database.  For imaginary data
            (see KIMG on the *SET command), Clab defaults to CIn.

        kshs
            Shell-to-solid submodeling key:

            0 - Solid-to-solid or shell-to-shell submodel.

            1 - Shell-to-solid submodel.

        tolout
            Extrapolation tolerance about elements, based on a fraction of the
            element dimension. Submodel nodes outside the element by more than
            TOLOUT are not accepted as candidates for DOF extrapolation.
            Defaults to 0.5 (50 percent).

        tolhgt
            Height tolerance above or below shell elements, in units of length.
            Used only for shell-to-shell submodeling (KSHS = 0). Submodel nodes
            off the element surface by more than TOLHGT are not accepted as
            candidates for degree-of-freedom interpolation or extrapolation.
            Defaults to 0.0001 times the maximum element dimension.

        tolthk
            Height tolerance above or below shell elements, based on a fraction
            of the shell element thickness. Used only for shell-to-solid
            submodeling (KSHS = 1). Submodel nodes off the element surface by
            more than TOLTHK are not accepted as candidates for DOF
            interpolation or extrapolation. Defaults to 0.1 times the average
            shell thickness.

        Notes
        -----
        File Fname1 should contain a node list for which boundary conditions
        are to be interpolated (NWRITE).  File Fname2 is created to contain
        interpolated boundary conditions written as a block of D commands.

        Boundary conditions are written for the active degree-of-freedom set
        for the element from which interpolation is performed. Interpolation
        occurs on the selected set of elements.  The block of D commands begins
        with an identifying colon label and ends with a /EOF command.  The
        colon label is of the form :Clab (described above).

        Interpolation from multiple results sets can be performed by looping
        through the results file in a user-defined macro.  Additional blocks
        can be appended to Fname2 by using KPOS and unique colon labels.  To
        read the block of commands, issue the /INPUT command with the
        appropriate colon label.

        If the model has coincident (or very close) nodes, the CBDOF must be
        applied to each part of the model separately to ensure that the mapping
        of the nodes is correct.  For example, if nodes belonging to two
        adjacent parts linked by springs are coincident, the operation should
        be performed on each part of the model separately.

        Resume the coarse model database at the beginning of the cut-boundary
        procedure. The database should have been saved after the first coarse
        model solution, as the number of nodes in the database and the results
        file must match, and internal nodes are sometimes created during the
        solution.

        Caution:: : Relaxing the TOLHGT or TOLTHK tolerances to allow submodel
        nodes to be “found” can produce poor submodel results.

                       0.0 through 1.0. Default = 0.9. (Valid only for Action =
                       ADD, Action = LIST, or Action = DELETE.)

            WEAR - This option is valid only for contact elements having surface wear specified
                   (TB,WEAR). Define VAL1 as a critical ratio of magnitude of
                   wear to the average depth of the solid element underlying
                   the contact element. Once this critical ratio is reached for
                   any element, the program morphs the mesh to improve the
                   quality of the elements. VAL1 must be a positive integer.
                   (Valid only for Action = ADD, Action = LIST, or Action =
                   DELETE.) The WEAR criterion cannot be combined with any
                   other criterion.

            ALL  - All options. (Valid only for Action = LIST or Action = DELETE. All subsequent
                   arguments are ignored.)

        Notes
        -----
        If a specified component (Component) is an assembly, the defined
        criterion applies to all element components included in the assembly.

        All components must be defined and selected before the first solve
        (SOLVE), although their nonlinear adaptivity criteria can be modified
        from load step to load step, and upon restart. For nonlinear adaptivity
        to work properly, ensure that all components are selected before each
        solve.

        After using this command to define a new criterion, the new criterion
        becomes active and is checked one time during each load step, roughly
        in mid-loading (unless this behavior is changed via Action = ON).

        When a criterion is defined, it overwrites a previously defined
        criterion (if one exists) through the same component, or through the
        component assembly that includes the specified component.

        During solution, the same criteria defined for an element through
        different components are combined, and the tightest criteria and action
        control (Action,ON,,,VAL1) are used. If an ON action is defined by a
        positive VAL1 value through one component and a negative VAL1 value
        through another, the program uses the positive value.

        For Action = ON, if VAL2 (start time) and/or VAL3 (end time) are
        unspecified or invalid, the program uses the start and/or end time
        (respectively) of the load step. If VAL1 < 0, the program checks VAL1
        points between VAL2 and VAL3. The time interval between each check
        points is determined by (VAL3 - VAL2) / (VAL1 + 1), with the first
        check point as close to VAL2 + (VAL3 - VAL2) / (VAL1 + 1) as possible.
        Fewer check points can be used if the number of substeps during
        solution is insufficient (as the program can only check at the end of a
        substep).

        Option = SKEWNESS applies to linear tetrahedral element SOLID285 only.
        When the skewness of a SOLID285 element is >= the defined value, the
        element is used as the core (seed) element of the remeshed region(s).
        If this criterion is used together with any other criteria for the same
        component, the other criteria defined for the component are ignored.
        The most desirable skewness value is 0, applicable when the element is
        a standard tetrahedral element; the highest value is 1, applicable when
        the element becomes flat with zero volume. For more information about
        skewness and remeshing, see Mesh Nonlinear Adaptivity in the Advanced
        Analysis Guide.

            Reference number of coordinate system where the pattern is to be

        Parameters
        ----------
        label
            One of the following labels:

            ADD - Adds a new specification to the set (default). The maximum number of
                  specifications that can be defined is 50.

            LIST - Lists the current set of specifications. Node, Item, Comp are ignored.

        node
            The node at which to evaluate the results. If Node is a nodal
            component, then all nodes in the component are included. All
            sectors containing this node (or set of nodes) are evaluated.

        item
            Specifies the type of values to evaluate:

            U - Displacement

            S - Stress

            EPEL - Elastic strain

            X,Y,Z - Direct components

            XY,YZ,XZ - Shear components (stress and strain only)

            1,2,3 - Principal values (stress and strain only)

            EQV - Equivalent value (stress and strain only)

            SUM - Vector sum (displacement only)

            NORM - L2 norm for the set of nodes (displacement only)

        Notes
        -----
        Up to 50 specifications can be defined for use in a subsequent CYCCALC
        command. If more than 50 specifications are desired, erase the table
        after the CYCCALC operation and add new specifications and repeat the
        CYCCALC command. All the specified nodes, items, and components are
        evaluated for all sectors and the maximum amplitude value output. For
        combined stresses and strains (Comp = 1,2,3 or EQV) or displacement
        vector sum (Comp = SUM), a 360 degree phase sweep is performed at each
        location to determine the maximum.

        Additional POST1 controls are used to refine the specification. For
        component values, components are in the RSYS direction. For shell
        elements, the results are at the SHELL location. For EPEL,EQV, the
        results are based on the EFFNU value on the AVPRIN command. The
        controls active when the CYCCALC command is issued determine the result
        values. If results at another SHELL location are desired, issue the new
        SHELL command and then re-issue the CYCCALC command.

        If a single node is input, the Item/Comp value at that location in each
        sector is output. If a node component is given, then the maximum
        Item/Comp value within the set of nodes of each sector is output, one
        value for each sector (the node of the maximum may vary from sector to
        sector). For stress and strain items, only corner nodes are valid.

        For the displacement norm option (Item = U, Comp = NORM), the L2 norm
        computed from all the nodes in the component is output, one per sector.

        Notes
        -----
        ADAMS invokes a predefined ANSYS macro that solves a series of analyses
        and then writes the modal neutral file, Jobname.MNF. This file can be
        imported into the ADAMS program in order to perform a rigid body
        dynamics simulation. For detailed information on how to use the ADAMS
        command macro to create a modal neutral file, see Rigid Body Dynamics
        and the ANSYS-ADAMS Interface in the Substructuring Analysis Guide.

        Before running the ADAMS command macro, you must specify the units with
        the /UNITS command. The interface points should be the only selected
        nodes when the command macro is initiated. (Interface points are nodes
        where constraints may be applied in ADAMS.) Only selected elements will
        be considered in the calculations.

        By default, stress and strain data is transferred to the ADAMS program
        for all nodes, as specified by the KSTRESS value.  If you want to
        transfer stress/strain data for only a subset of nodes, select the
        desired subset and create a node component named "STRESS" before
        running the ADAMS command macro.  For example, you may want to select
        exterior nodes for the purpose of visualization in the ADAMS program.

        The default filename for the modal neutral file is Jobname.MNF. In
        interactive (GUI) mode, you can specify a filename other than
        Jobname.MNF. In batch mode, there is no option to change the filename,
        and the modal neutral file is always written to Jobname.MNF.

            0 - Do not overwrite existing .Xnnn files (default). The total maximum number of
                .Xnnn files for one run is 999. If this number is reached

                this number of .Rnnn have been written, ANSYS will overwrite
                the first .Xnnn file of the subsequent multifield time step.

        -----
        This command sets up the restart parameters for a multiframe restart,
        allowing you to restart an analysis from any multifield time step for
        which there is a .Rnnn file. You can perform a multiframe restart only
        for nonlinear static and full transient structural, thermal and
        thermal- structural (see RESCONTROL for details).

        If you have many multifield time steps, and are writing .Xnnn files
        frequently, use MAXFILES to limit the number of .Xnnn files saved,
        since these files can fill up your disk quickly.

        For a CFX analysis, you must also configure the MFOUTPUT and MFRSTART
        settings to ensure consistent time points for postprocessing and
        restart simulation.

        For MFX simulation, the RESCONTROL command will be ignored.

        Default Behavior

        In nonlinear static and full transient analyses, the default behavior
        is multiframe restart. (MFRC,LAST). By default, the .Rnnn file is
        written at the last multifield time step . An .Rnnn file and
        corresponding load set of .ldhi files is also written at the multifield
        time step prior to the abort point of the run if an abort file was
        used, or if the job terminated because of a failure to converge or some
        other solution error. No information at the aborted multifield time
        step is saved in either the .Rnnn file or the .ldhi file.

        This command cannot be issued after restarting a multifield analysis.

        The missing mass calculation is valid only for single point excitation
        response spectrum analysis (SPOPT, SPRS) and for multiple point
        response spectrum analysis (SPOPT, MPRS) performed with base excitation
        using acceleration response spectrum loading. Missing mass is supported
        in a spectrum analysis only when the preceding modal analysis is
        performed with the Block Lanczos, PCG Lanczos, Supernode, or Subspace
        eigensolver (Method =LANB, LANPCG, SNODE, or SUBSP on the MODOPT
        command).

        The velocity solution is not available (Label = VELO on the combination
        command: SRSS, CQC...) when the missing mass calculation is activated.

        The missing mass calculation is not supported when the spectrum
        analysis is based on a linear perturbation modal analysis performed
        after a nonlinear base analysis.

        The missing mass is not supported when superelements are present.

        To take into account the contribution of the truncated modes, the
        residual vector (RESVEC) can be used in place of the missing mass
        response. This is of particular interest if the velocity solution is
        requested or if a nonlinear prestress is included in the analysis
        (linear perturbation), or if a superelement is present, since the
        missing mass cannot be used in these cases.

        In a multiple point response spectrum analysis (SPOPT,MPRS), the MMASS
        command must precede the participation factor calculation command
        (PFACT).

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

                   command.

            MPRS - Multiple point excitation response spectrum.

            DDAM - Dynamic design analysis method.

        modereusekey

            NO - No spectrum analysis has been performed yet (default).

            YES - This is not the first spectrum analysis.  The MODE file will be reused and the

        Parameters
        ----------
        na1, na2, na3, . . . , na6
            List of areas in the pattern to be dragged (6 maximum if using
            keyboard entry).  If NA1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).  If
            NA1 = ALL, all selected areas will be swept along the path.  A
            component name may also be substituted for NA1.

        nlp1, nlp2, nlp3, . . . , nlp6
            List of lines defining the path along which the pattern is to  be
            dragged (6 maximum if using keyboard entry).  Must be a continuous
            set of lines.  To be continuous, adjacent lines must share the
            connecting keypoint (the end keypoint of one line must also be
            first keypoint of the next line).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates volumes (and their corresponding keypoints, lines, and areas)
        by sweeping a given area pattern along a characteristic drag path.  If
        the drag path consists of multiple lines, the drag direction is
        determined by the sequence in which the path lines are input (NLP1,
        NLP2, etc.).  If the drag path is a single line (NLP1), the drag
        direction is from the keypoint on the drag line that is closest to the
        first keypoint of the given area pattern to the other end of the drag
        line.

        The magnitude of the vector between the keypoints of the given pattern
        and the first path keypoint remains constant for all generated keypoint
        patterns and the path keypoints.  The direction of the vector relative
        to the path slope also remains constant so that patterns may be swept
        around curves.  Lines are generated with the same shapes as the given
        pattern and the path lines.

        Keypoint, line, area, and volume numbers are automatically assigned
        (beginning with the lowest available values [NUMSTR]).  Adjacent lines
        use a common keypoint, adjacent areas use a common line, and adjacent
        volumes use a common area.  For best results, the entities to be
        dragged should be orthogonal to the start of the drag path.  Drag
        operations that produce an error message may create some of the desired
        entities prior to terminating.

        If element attributes have been associated with the input area via the
        AATT command, the opposite area generated by the VDRAG operation will
        also have those attributes (i.e., the element attributes from the input
        area are copied to the opposite area).  Note that only the area
        opposite the input area will have the same attributes as the input
        area; the areas adjacent to the input area will not.

        If the input areas are meshed or belong to a meshed volume, the area(s)
        can be extruded to a 3-D mesh.  Note that the NDIV argument of the
        ESIZE command should be set before extruding the meshed areas.
        Alternatively, mesh divisions can be specified directly on the drag
        line(s) (LESIZE).  See the Modeling and Meshing Guide for more
        information.

        You can use the VDRAG command to generate 3-D interface element meshes
        for elements INTER194 and INTER195. When generating interface element
        meshes using VDRAG, you must specify the line divisions to generate one
        interface element directly on the drag line using the LESIZE command.
        The source area to be extruded becomes the bottom surface of the
        interface element. Interface elements must be extruded in what will
        become the element's local x direction, that is, bottom to top.

            Names of existing element components for which Maxwell or virtual

        Notes
        -----
        FMAGSUM invokes an ANSYS macro that summarizes the Maxwell and virtual
        work forces.  The element components must have had appropriate Maxwell
        or virtual work boundary conditions established in the preprocessor
        prior to solution in order to retrieve forces (see FMAGBC, SF, BF
        commands). The forces are also stored on a per-element basis for the
        adjacent air layer surrounding the components in the element table
        [ETABLE].  Maxwell forces are stored as items FMX_X, FMX_Y, and FMX_Z,
        and virtual work forces are stored as items FVW_X, FVW_Y, and FVW_Z.
        Use the PLETAB and PRETAB commands to plot and list the element table
        items.

         If using elements PLANE121, SOLID122, SOLID123, PLANE233, SOLID236,
        and SOLID237, use EMFT to summarize electromagnetic force and torque.

        FMAGSUM can also be used to summarize time-average forces from a 2-D

            Reference number of coordinate system where the pattern is to be

        np1, np2, ninc
            Transfer keypoints from pattern beginning with NP1 to NP2 (defaults
            to NP1) in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).  If NP1 = ALL, NP2 and

            keypoint numbers are assigned [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            0 - Generate nodes and point elements associated with the original keypoints, if
                they exist.

            1 - Do not generate nodes and elements.

        imove
            Specifies whether keypoints will be moved or newly defined:

            0 - Generate additional keypoints.

            1 - Move original keypoints to new position retaining the same keypoint numbers
                (KINC and NOELEM are ignored).  Valid only if the old keypoints
                are no longer needed at their original positions.

        APDL Command: ASEL

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Label identifying the type of select:

            S - Select a new set (default)

            R - Reselect a set from the current set.

            A - Additionally select a set and extend the current set.

            U - Unselect a set from the current set.

            ALL - Restore the full set.

            NONE - Unselect the full set.

            INVE - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            STAT - Display the current select status.

        Notes
        -----
        Selects a subset of areas. For example, to select those areas with area
        numbers 1 through 7, use ASEL,S,AREA,,1,7.  The selected subset is then
        used when the ALL label is entered (or implied) on other commands, such
        as ALIST,ALL.  Only data identified by area number are selected.  Data
        are flagged as selected and unselected; no data are actually deleted
        from the database.

        In a cyclic symmetry analysis, area hot spots can be modified.
        Consequently, the result of an area selection may be different before
        and after the CYCLIC command.

        If Item = ACCA, the command selects only those areas that were created
        by concatenation.  The KSWP field is processed, but the Comp, VMIN,
        VMAX, and VINC fields are ignored.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        For Selects based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.),
        items that are within the range VMIN-Toler and VMAX+Toler are selected.
        The default tolerance Toler is based on the relative values of VMIN and
        VMAX as follows:

        If VMIN = VMAX, Toler = 0.005 x VMIN.

        If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, Toler = 1.0E-6.

         If VMAX ≠ VMIN, Toler = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

        Use the SELTOL command to override this default and specify Toler
        explicitly.

        value
            Relaxation value. Defaults to 0.75 for all labels.

            LINT  - Uses a linear interpolation for loaf transfer.

        Notes

        MFRELAX sets relaxation values for the load transfer variables at a

        stable and smooth load transfer and is suitable for strongly coupled
        problems (such as FSI problems). Option = LINT is suitable for weakly
        coupled problems because it will transfer the full load in fewer
        stagger iterations.

        APDL Command: DCVSWP

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Sweep option:

            GV - Perform voltage sweep up to given voltage Vmax.

        elem
            Element number of the ROM element for the ROM use pass analysis.

        cnum
            Number of sweep conductor.

        vmax
            Maximum voltage. For the PI option, this voltage should be below
            the pull-in voltage value.

        vinc1
            Voltage increment for Vmax (default = Vmax/20).

        vinc2
            Voltage increment for pull-in voltage (default = 1).

        gap
            Gap elements option:

            0 - Create gap elements (COMBIN40) (default).

        Notes
        -----
        Vinc1 is used to ramp the sweep conductor voltage from 0 to Vmax. Vinc2
        is used to increase the sweep conductor voltage from Vmax to the pull-
        in value if the PI sweep option is used.

        Because ramping the voltage may lead to the unstable region of an
        electromechanical system, DCVSWP might not converge when the sweep
        conductor voltage approaches the pull-in value. To avoid non-converged
        solutions, you should use the gap option to create a set of spring-gap
        elements (COMBIN40). By default, DCVSWP creates two spring-gap elements
        with opposite orientations for each active modal displacement DOF of
        the ROM element. The gap size is set to the maximum absolute values of
        the deflection range for the corresponding mode, as calculated by
        RMMSELECT or modified  using the RMMRANGE command. The spring constants
        are set to 1.E5 for all the COMBIN40 elements. Along with the spring-
        gap elements, DCVSWP creates a set of constraint equations relating the
        ROM element modal displacements DOF (EMF) and the displacement DOF (UX)
        of the gap elements. Constraining the modal displacements using the
        spring-gap elements allows DCVSWP to converge in the pull-in range. The
        DCVSWP macro has a limit of 900 equilibrium iterations. If this limit
        is not sufficient to reach convergence, try the advanced techniques
        given in Overcoming Convergence Problems in the Structural Analysis
        Guide. For more information on gap elements, see Using Gap Elements

            Coordinate system type:

            0 or CART - Cartesian

            1 or CYLIN - Cylindrical (circular or elliptical)

            2 or SPHE - Spherical (or spheroidal)

            3 or TORO - Toroidal

        porig
            Keypoint defining the origin of this coordinate system.  If PORIG =
            P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields
            are ignored (valid only in the GUI).

        pxaxs
            Keypoint defining the positive x-axis orientation of this
            coordinate system.

        pxypl
            Keypoint defining the x-y plane (with PORIG and PXAXS) in the first
            or second quadrant of this coordinate system.

        par1
            Used for elliptical, spheroidal, or toroidal systems.  If KCS = 1
            or 2, PAR1 is the ratio of the ellipse Y-axis radius to X-axis
            radius (defaults to 1.0 (circle)).  If KCS = 3, PAR1 is the major
            radius of the torus.

        par2
            Used for spheroidal systems.  If KCS = 2, PAR2 = ratio of ellipse
            Z-axis radius to X-axis radius (defaults to 1.0 (circle)).

        PLCRACK displays circles at locations of cracking or crushing in
        concrete elements.  Cracking is shown with a circle outline in the
        plane of the crack, and crushing is shown with an octahedron outline.
        If the crack has opened and then closed, the circle outline will have
        an X through it.  Each integration point can crack in up to three
        different planes.  The first crack at an integration point is shown
        with a red circle outline, the second crack with a green outline, and
        the third crack with a blue outline.

        Symbols shown at the element centroid (LOC = 1) are based on the status
        of all of the element's integration points.  If any integration point
        in the element has crushed, the crushed (octahedron) symbol is shown at
        the centroid.  If any integration point has cracked or cracked and
        closed, the cracked symbol is shown at the element centroid.  If at
        least five integration points have cracked and closed, the cracked and
        closed symbol is shown at the element centroid.  Finally, if more than
        one integration point has cracked, the circle outline at the element

            ZLOC - Define by Z levels.

            PIP - Associate an internal pipe or pipes with an external pipe.

        zonename
            The ocean zone name. If no name is specified, the program assigns
            one.

        compnameint
            For Zonetype = COMP, the required name of a component.

        compnameext
            For Zonetype = PIP, the required name of an external pipe
            component.

        Notes
        -----
        The OCZONE command specifies the type of ocean zone data to follow
        (component, Z-level, or internal pipes associated with an external
        pipe). An ocean zone is a local space where you can override global
        ocean-loading parameters.

        Names specified for ZoneName, CompNameInt, and CompNameExt can consist
        of up to 32 alphanumeric characters. The name cannot contain
        punctuation, special characters, or spaces.

        For Zonetype = COMP, the zone is defined by a component. Only the
        elements in the component are affected by the local parameters. A
        partial component can be defined as the zone via the Z input on the
        OCTABLE command.

        For Zonetype = ZLOC, the zone is defined by Z levels. Structural
        elements (such as BEAM188, BEAM189, PIPE288, PIPE289, and LINK180) in
        the Z levels are included in the zone.

        For Zonetype = PIP, the zone is prepared for a special configuration of
        pipes. It associates an internal pipe or pipes with an external pipe to
        remove the hydrodynamic effect on the internal pipe. Only hydrostatic
        pressure is applied on the internal pipe.

            or 3.

        keyshape
            One of the following element shape options:

            ANYSHAPE - Any shape (that is, no specified shape). This value is the default. (The ANSYS
                       MeshTool is unavailable.)

            POINT - Point.

            LINE - Straight line.

            TRIAN - Triangle.

            QUAD - Quadrilateral. This shape can be degenerated to a triangle.

            TET - Tetrahedron.

            BRICK - Brick. This shape can be degenerated to a wedge, pyramid, or tetrahedron.

        nreal
            The number of real constants.

        nsavevars
            The number of saved variables.

        nrsltvar
            The number of variables saved in results files.

        keyansmat
            Key for element formulation control:

            0 - Create your own material codes within the element formulation. In this case,
                the real constants are available to input material properties.
                You can also input linear material properties via MP and MPDATA
                commands .

            1 - Use ANSYS standard material routines or the USERMAT subroutine to form
                structural material data. ANSYS material properties must be
                input in the standard way (as you would for non-user-defined
                elements). This value is invalid when KeyShape = ANYSHAPE.

        nintpnts
            The maximum number of integration points (used when KEYANSMAT = 1).

        kestress
            Key for the element stress state (used when KEYANSMAT = 1):

            0 - Plane stress elements.

            1 - Axisymmetric elements.

            2 - Plane strain elements.

            8 - 3-D shell elements.

            9 - Axisymmetric shell elements.

        keysym
            Key for specifying whether element stiffness matrices are symmetric
            or unsymmetric:

            0 - Symmetric.

            1 - Unsymmetric.

        Notes
        -----
        The USRELEM command specifies the characteristics of the user-defined
        element USER300.

        Although you can intersperse other commands as necessary for your
        analysis, issue the USRELEM command as part of the following general
        sequence of commands:

        Issue the ET command for element USER300, followed by the related TYPE
        command.

        Issue both the USRELEM and USRDOF commands (in either order).

        Define your element using USER300.

        The number of real constants (NREAL) can refer to geometry quantities,
        material quantities, or any parameters for element formulation.

        ANSYS saves variables in the .esav file to preserve element data when
        you specify a positive NSAVEVARS value. When KEYANSMAT = 0, all
        variables of both material and kinematic formulation are saved. When
        KEYANSMAT = 1, only the variables for kinematic formulation (such as
        deformation gradient tensor) are saved; in this case, the material
        routine saves all necessary material data automatically.

        Element data saved in results files (NRSLTVAR) are accessible only as
        nonsummable miscellaneous data.  ANSYS saves stress and total strain
        data for structural elements in the .rst file automatically (as it does
        for equivalent variables such as thermal gradient and thermal flux in
        thermal elements); therefore, NRSLTVAR does not need to include stress
        and total strain data.

        min
             Minimum contact entity number to be selected and plotted (default
            = 1).

        max
            Maximum contact entity number to be selected and plotted (default =

        Notes
        -----
        EDPC invokes an ANSYS macro which selects and plots explicit dynamic
        contact entities. The plot will consist of nodes or elements, depending
        on the method (node components or parts) that was used to define the
        contact surfaces (see the EDCGEN command). For single surface contact
        definitions, all external surfaces within the model are plotted.

        Note:: : EDPC changes the selected set of nodes and elements. After
        plotting contact entities, you must reselect all nodes and elements
        (NSEL and ESEL) required for subsequent operations, such as SOLVE

        Use the EDCLIST command to list the contact entity numbers for all
        defined contact.

        option
            Specify the operations for which you intend to enable/disable
            parallel behavior:

            ALL  - Enable/disable parallel for all areas (default).

        Notes
        -----
        Use this command in shared-memory parallel operations.

        This command is useful when you encounter minor discrepancies in a
        nonlinear solution when using different numbers of processors. A
        parallel operation applied to the element matrix generation can produce
        a different nonlinear solution with a different number of processors.
        Although the nonlinear solution converges to the same nonlinear
        tolerance, the minor discrepancy created may not be desirable for
        consistency.

        Enabling/disabling parallel behavior for the solution (Option = SOLU)
        supersedes the activation/deactivation of parallel behavior for element
        matrix generation (FORM), equation solver (SOLV), and element results
        calculation (RESU).

        The SOLV option supports only the sparse direct and PCG solvers
        (EQSLV,SPARSE or PCG). No other solvers are supported.

        -----
        The /GTYPE command controls which entities the GPLOT command displays.
        NODE, ELEM, KEYP, LINE, AREA, and VOLU are on by default.  When ELEM is
        activated, you can control the type of element displayed via the /GCMD
        command (which also controls the type of graph display).  When the GRPH
        entity type is activated, all other entity types are deactivated.
        Conversely, when any of the NODE, ELEM, KEYP, LINE, AREA, and VOLU
        entity types are active, the GRPH entity type is deactivated.

        The /GTYPE command gives you several options for multi-window layout:

        One window

        Two windows (left and right or top and bottom of the screen)

        Three windows (two at the top and one at the bottom of the screen, or

        APDL Command: QUAD

        Parameters
        ----------
        node1
            Begin fill-in from this node location.  If NODE1 = P, graphical
            picking is enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored
            (valid only in the GUI).

        nintr
            Intermediate or guiding node.  Quadratic curve will pass through
            this location.  NINTR may have any node number and any location.
            If the quadratic line also generates a node with number NINTR, the
            generated location overrides the previous NINTR location.

        node2
            End quadratic fill-in at this node location.

        nfill
            Fill-in NFILL nodes between NODE1 and NODE2 (defaults to
            |NODE2-NODE1|-1).  NFILL must be positive.

        nstrt
            Node number assigned to first filled-in node (defaults to NODE1 +
            NINC).

        ninc
            Add this increment to each of the remaining filled-in node numbers
            (may be positive or negative).  Defaults to (NODE2-NODE1)/(NFILL +
            1), i.e., linear interpolation.

        pkfac
            Peak location factor.  If PKFAC=0.5, the peak of the quadratic
            shape occurs at the NINTR location.  If 0.0 < PKFAC < 0.5, the peak
            occurs to the NODE2 side of the NINTR location.  If 0.5 < PKFAC <
            1.0, the peak occurs to the NODE1 side of the NINTR location.
            Defaults to 0.5.

        Notes
        -----
        Generates a quadratic line of nodes (in the active coordinate system)
        from three nodes.  The three nodes determine the plane of the curve and
        may have been defined in any coordinate system.  Any number of nodes
        may be filled-in and any node number sequence may be assigned.

        The quadratic line feature uses three nodes (NODE1,NINTR,NODE2) to
        determine the plane of the curve.  The curve passes through the three
        points, beginning from NODE1, through the intermediate (or guiding)
        point NINTR, and toward NODE2.

        Generated nodes are also quadratically spaced.  If the guiding node
        number is within the set being generated, it will be relocated
        according to the quadratic spacing.

        The peak location factor is used to determine how the quadratic fits
        through the three points.  Various nodal progressions can be obtained
        by different combinations of PKFAC and the guiding node location.  If
        the guiding node is at mid-length between NODE1 and NODE2, 0.293:
        PKFAC< 0.707 will ensure that all generated nodes fall within the
        NODE1,NODE2 bounds.  In the limit, as PKFAC approaches 0.0, the peak
        approaches the line through NODE1 and NINTR at an infinite distance
        from NODE1.  The QUAD command generates quadratic lines of nodes, which
        in turn may be used as a base line for generating irregular surfaces of
        nodes (by repeating [*REPEAT], generating [NGEN, NSCALE], etc.).
        Irregular surfaces may also be generated with the meshing commands.

        key
            Large-deflection key:

            OFF - Ignores large-deflection effects (that is, a small-deflection analysis is

                 according to the element type.

        Notes
        -----
        Large-deflection effects are categorized as either large deflection (or
        large rotation) or large strain, depending on the element type. These
        are listed (if available) under Special Features in the input data
        table for each element in the Element Reference. When large deflection
        effects are included (NLGEOM,ON), stress stiffening effects are also
        included automatically.

        If used during the solution (/SOLU), this command is valid only within
        the first load step.

        In a large-deflection analysis, pressure loads behave differently than
        other load types. For more information, see Load Direction in a Large-
        Deflection Analysis.

        The gyroscopic matrix (that occurs due to rotational angular velocity)
        does not support large-deflection effects. The theoretical formulations
        for the gyroscopic matrix support small deflection (linear formulation)
        only.

        When large-deflection effects are included in a substructure or CMS
        transient analysis use pass, the OUTRES command ignores DSUBres = ALL.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        In ANSYS Professional NLT, large deflection effects should not be
        turned on if 2-D solid (PLANEn) or 3-D solid (SOLIDn) elements are

        The NUMCMP command effectively compresses out unused item numbers by
        renumbering all the items, beginning with one and continuing throughout

        defined items are renumbered, regardless of whether or not they are
        actually used or selected.  Applicable related items are also checked

        Parameters
        ----------
        kpoi
            Keypoint at which force is to be specified.  If ALL, apply to all
            selected keypoints [KSEL].  If KPOI = P, graphical picking is
            enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in
            the GUI).  A component name may also be substituted for KPOI.

        lab
            Valid force label.  Structural labels:  FX, FY, or FZ (forces); MX,
            MY, or MZ (moments).  Thermal labels:  HEAT, HBOT, HE2, HE3, . . .,
            HTOP (heat flow).  Fluid labels:  FLOW (fluid flow).  Electric
            labels:  AMPS (current flow), CHRG (electric charge).  Magnetic
            labels:  FLUX (magnetic flux);  CSGX, CSGY, or CSGZ (magnetic
            current segments). Diffusion labels: RATE (diffusion flow rate).

        value
            Force value or table name reference for specifying tabular boundary
            conditions.  To specify a table, enclose the table name in percent
            signs (%), e.g., FK, KPOI, HEAT,%tabname%).  Use the *DIM command
            to define a table.

        value2
            Second force value (if any).  If the analysis type and the force
            allow a complex input, VALUE (above) is the real component and
            VALUE2 is the imaginary component.

        Notes
        -----
        This command specifies entity numbering and coloring for subsequent
        plots.

        The MAT, TYPE, REAL, and ESYS labels activate both the numbering and

        APLOT, and VPLOT. The ELEM, MAT, TYPE, REAL, ESYS, PART (ANSYS LS-DYNA
        only), and LOC labels are mutually exclusive, i.e., only one can be
        specified at a time. Also, turning on a LINE, AREA, or VOLU label will
        turn off the MAT, TYPE, REAL, and PART labels.

        PowerGraphics [/GRAPHICS,POWER] displays for/PNUM can be problematic.
        /PNUM,ELEM will display erratically depending on other display command

        field (EF), and uses path operations for the calculations. All path
        items are cleared when the macro finishes executing.

        The EMF macro sets the "ACCURATE" mapping method and "MAT"

        Reads a file containing IGES data and transfers it into the ANSYS

        file.  IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) is a neutral
        format developed by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Institute of
        Standards and Technology.  There is no output transfer file written
        since the transferred data is read directly into the ANSYS database.

        You can import multiple files into a single database, but you must use
        the same import option (set with the IOPTN command) for each file.

        The IOPTN command sets the parameters for reading the file.  Files read
        via the SMOOTH method (the only available method) use the standard

            Node number on this element for which data are to be stored. If
            blank, store the average element value (except for FMAG values,
            which are summed instead of averaged). If NODE = P, graphical
            picking is enabled (valid only in the GUI).

        item
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in
            Table 134: ESOL - General Item and Component Labels below. Some
            items also require a component label.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are
            shown in Table 134: ESOL - General Item and Component Labels below.
            If Comp is a sequence number (n), the NODE field will be ignored.

        name
            Thirty-two character name for identifying the item on the printout
            and displays.  Defaults to a label formed by concatenating the
            first four characters of the Item and Comp labels.

        Notes
        -----
        See Table: 134:: ESOL - General Item and Component Labels for a list of
        valid item and component labels for element (except line element)
        results.

        The ESOL command defines element results data to be stored from a
        results file (FILE). Not all items are valid for all elements. To see
        the available items for a given element, refer to the input and output
        summary tables in the documentation for that element.

        Two methods of data access are available via the ESOL command. You can
        access some simply by using a generic label (component name method),
        while others require a label and number (sequence number method).

        Use the component name method to access general element data (that is,
        element data generally available to most element types or groups of
        element types).

        The sequence number method is required for data that is not averaged
        (such as pressures at nodes and temperatures at integration points), or
        data that is not easily described in a generic fashion (such as all
        derived data for structural line elements and contact elements, all
        derived data for thermal line elements, and layer data for layered
        elements).

        Element results are in the element coordinate system, except for
        layered elements where results are in the layer coordinate system.
        Element forces and moments are in the nodal coordinate system. Results
        are obtainable for an element at a specified node. Further location
        specifications can be made for some elements via the SHELL, LAYERP26,
        and FORCE commands.

        Notes
        -----
        The EDCNSTR command allows you to define several types of constraints
        in an explicit dynamic analysis. A brief description of each constraint
        type is given below. See Constraints and Initial Conditions in the
        ANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide for more information.

        Extra Node Set Added to a Rigid Body (Ctype = ENS)

        The ability to add extra nodes to an existing rigid body has many
        potential applications, including placing nodes where joints will be
        attached between rigid bodies, defining nodes where point loads will be
        applied, and defining a lumped mass at a specific location. The extra
        nodes specified by Comp2 may be located anywhere in the model and may
        have coordinates outside those of the original rigid body specified by
        Comp1.

        Nodal Rigid Body (Ctype = NRB)

        Unlike typical rigid bodies that are defined with the EDMP command,
        nodal rigid bodies defined with the EDCNSTR command are not associated
        with a part number. This can be advantageous for modeling rigid
        (welded) joints in a model. For a rigid joint, portions of different
        flexible components (having different MAT IDs) act together as a rigid
        body. It is difficult to define this type of rigid body with a unique
        MAT ID (and corresponding part number). However, the rigid joint can be
        easily defined using a nodal rigid body.

        Shell Edge to Solid Tie (Ctype = STS)

        The STS option ties regions of solid elements to regions of shell
        elements. A single shell node may be tied to up to nine brick element
        nodes that define a “fiber” vector. Solid element nodes constrained in
        this way remain linear throughout the analysis but can move relative to
        each other in the fiber direction.

        Rivet between Two Nodes (Ctype = RIVET)

        The RIVET option defines a massless rigid constraint between two nodes,
        similar to spotwelds defined with the EDWELD command. Unlike a
        spotweld, however, rivets contain nodes that are noncoincident, and
        failure cannot be specified. When a rivet is defined, the distance
        between the nodes is kept constant throughout any motion that occurs
        during a simulation. Nodes connected by a rivet cannot be part of any
        other constraints specified in the model.

        The EDCNSTR command is also valid in SOLUTION.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sfirst
            First section ID to be summarized. Defaults to first available
            section in the database.

        slast
            Last section ID to be summarized. Defaults to last available
            section in the database.

        sinc
            Increment of the section ID; defaults to 1.

        details
            Determines the content of the summarized information for beams and
            shells.

            BRIEF - For beams, lists only the section integrated properties (such as Area, Iyy, and
                    Iyz). This option is the default.

            FULL - For beams, lists the section integrated properties, as well as the section
                   nodal coordinates, section cell connectivity information,
                   and section cell integration point coordinates. For shells,
                   the section stiffness (membrane, bending, membrane-bending
                   coupling and transverse shear) are printed.

            The shell section stiffness listed considers elastic behavior of materials at reference temperature only. The elements that use the section data may alter the transverse shear stiffness based on slenderness considerations (in addition to the shear correction factors shown).  - Section stiffness terms listed via the FULL option do not include section
                              offsets. The ANSYS program considers section
                              offsets during the solution phase of the
                              analysis.

            GROUP - If a section calls other sections, this option lists those sections too.

        type
            The section type. Valid arguments are ALL (the default) and the
            types available on the SECTYPE command.

        Notes
        -----
        By default, the command lists information concerning all sections;

        mrun
            Keyword for the processing of the simulation loops

            SER - Executes the simulation loops of the probabilistic analysis using a single
                  machine; serial processing (default).

            PAR - Executes the simulation loops of the probabilistic analysis in parallel using
                  the ANSYS parallel-processing tool. See Probabilistic Design
                  in the Advanced Analysis Guide.

        nfail
            This parameter sets the number of loops that are allowed to fail
            before the execution of the probabilistic analysis is terminated.
            For example, if geometric parameters are used as random variables
            then for some simulations (loops) the loop will fail because
            meshing was not successful. This might happen infrequently which
            might be acceptable. However, if the probabilistic problem is
            incorrectly defined then loops could fail frequently or even in
            every loop. You can define an upper limit for the number of failed
            loops that will be tolerated before the probabilistic analysis will
            be terminated. If you use NFAIL = 0 (default) then failed loops are
            not tolerated and the probabilistic analysis will terminate the
            first time a loop fails. NFAIL is used only if MRUN = PAR.

        fopt
            Keyword for the file option. This determines if a copy of the
            sample file should be saved or not.

            DEL - The sample file will be deleted (default).

            COPY - A copy of the sample file will be saved as the file name specified with the
                   Fname option.

        fname
            Name of the copy of the sample file. The directory for storing the
            sample file is always the current working directory. The file
            extension is always .csmp. This option is ignored for FOPT = DEL.

        Notes
        -----
        Runs the probabilistic analysis. The results of the probabilistic
        analysis are identified with the solution label specified here. This
        solution label is used for the postprocessing of the results. The
        maximum number of probabilistic analyses that can be executed, stored,
        and post-processed based on the same deterministic and probabilistic
        model in one session with the PDS is 10. However, it is not counted as
        a separate probabilistic analysis if the same solution label is used
        multiple times in order to append to or overwrite previous results.

        The probabilistic results are stored in result files in ASCII format.

        If you specify a solution label that has already been used, the results
        will be appended at the end of the results file.

        After the PDEXE command has been issued, you can no longer change the
        probabilistic model using probabilistic preprocessing commands; doing
        so would invalidate the probabilistic analysis results and potentially
        corrupt the probabilistic database. Also, you are not allowed to change
        the probabilistic analysis file using a PDANL command after the first
        PDEXE has been executed.

        If you need to change the probabilistic model (analysis file, random
        input variables, etc.) after the PDEXE command has been issued, you
        should use the PDCLR, POST command to clear the probabilistic results.
        We recommend that you first save the results using the PDSAVE command.

        By default, ANSYS creates a sample file (called Jobname.samp)
        containing all values of all random input parameters; unless you
        specify otherwise, this file is deleted after the analysis is finished.
        With the FOPT and Fname options you can determine if and where a copy
        of that file should be stored for later use in another analysis.

        "Mapped triangle meshing" refers to the ANSYS program's ability to take
        a map-meshable area and mesh it with triangular elements, based on the

        element that supports only triangles), and you have also specified
        mapped meshing [MSHKEY,1] to mesh an area.

        Notes
        -----
        Initiates the element reordering based upon the previously defined
        starting wave lists (if any).  Reordering affects only the element
        order for the solution phase and not the element numbers (input
        referring to element numbers, such as element pressures, is unaffected
        by reordering).

        Note:: : The new order is retained only if new the new maximum or RMS
        wavefront values are lower than the old values, as described below.
        See the WSORT command for another reordering procedure.  The resulting
        element ordering can be shown by listing the wavefront history
        [WFRONT,1] or by displaying elements with their element location
        numbers [/PNUM].

        The WAVES reordering procedure is based upon a list of nodes defining
        where the element reordering is to start (either input on the WSTART
        command, or automatically determined if not input).  If a list is
        input, additional starting wave lists may be defined to allow the user
        to block or guide the wave.  An input starting list usually consists of
        one node for a line element model, a line of nodes for an area element
        model, or a plane of nodes for a volume element model.  Elements are
        ordered from the first starting wave list in a direction that attempts
        to minimize the wavefront.  Nodes are deleted and added to the total
        wave list set as reordering progresses through the model.  Elements
        attached to nodes on succeeding starting lists, if any, are ignored at
        this time, thereby temporarily blocking that path.  Whenever no more
        elements can be reordered, the procedure is repeated starting from the
        nodes defined on the second starting list (if any).  The same node
        number should not appear on more than one list.  If no starting list is
        input, a starting node is automatically selected from an element
        weighting procedure (see Element Reordering in the Mechanical APDL
        Theory Reference).

        Reordering may be made from the previously reordered model or from the
        initial model (by issuing the SAVE command before reordering and then
        restoring that model back to PREP7 with the RESUME command after
        reordering).  The WFRONT command is useful for calculating and printing
        the current wavefront statistics at any time without causing any
        reordering of the elements.  If a model is to be used for both a
        thermal and a structural analysis, the reordered statistics should be
        based upon the structural model (because of the higher number of
        degrees of freedom per node).

        The reordering procedure treats separate portions of the model (i.e.,
        not connected by elements) as discontinuous.  Reordering automatically
        continues across a discontinuity as best as possible.

            No - Do not combine solution files.

        Notes
        -----
        The DMPOPTION command controls how solution files are written during a
        distributed memory parallel (Distributed ANSYS) solution. This command
        is most useful for controlling how results files (.RST,.RTH, etc.) are
        written.

        In a distributed memory parallel solution, a local results file is
        written by each process (JobnameN.ext, where N is the process number).
        By default, the program automatically combines the local results files
        (for example, JobnameN.RST) upon leaving the SOLUTION processor (for
        example, upon the FINISH command) into a single global results file
        (Jobname.RST) which can be used in ANSYS postprocessing. To reduce the
        amount of communication and I/O performed by this operation, you can
        issue the command DMPOPTION,RST,NO to bypass this step of combining the
        local results files; the local files will remain on the local disks in
        the current working directory. You can then use the RESCOMBINE command
        macro in the POST1 general postprocessor (/POST1) to read all results
        into the database for postprocessing.

        The RESCOMBINE command macro is intended for use with POST1. If you
        want to postprocess distributed parallel solution results using the
        POST26 time-history postprocessor (/POST26), it is recommended that you
        combine your local results files into one global results file
        (DMPOPTION,RST,YES or COMBINE).

        Local .EMAT, .ESAV, .MODE, .MLV, .IST, .RFRQ, .RDSP, and .FULL files
        are also written (when applicable) by each process in a distributed
        memory parallel solution. If these files are not needed for a
        downstream solution or operation, you can issue the command
        DMPOPTION,FileType,NO for each file type to bypass the file combination
        step and thereby improve performance. You should not bypass the file
        combination step if a downstream PSD analysis or modal expansion pass
        will be performed.

        If DMPOPTION,MODE,NO or DMPOPTION,RST,NO is specified in a modal
        analysis, element results cannot be written to the combined mode file
        (Jobname.MODE). In this case, if Distributed ANSYS is used in a
        downstream harmonic or transient analysis that uses the mode-
        superposition method, the MSUPkey on the MXPAND command can retain its
        value. However, if shared memory parallel processing is used in the
        downstream harmonic or transient analysis, the MSUPkey is effectively
        set to NO.

        The DMPOPTION command can be changed between load steps; however, doing
        so will not affect which set of solution files are combined. Only the
        last values of FileType and Combine upon leaving the solution processor
        will be used to determine whether the solution files are combined. For
        example, given a two load step solution and FileType = RST, setting
        Combine = NO for the first load step and YES for the second load step
        will cause all sets on the local results files to be combined. If the
        opposite is true (Combine = YES for the first load step and NO for the
        second load step), no results will be combined.

        After using DMPOPTION to suppress file combination, you may find it
        necessary to combine the local files for a specific FileType for use in
        a subsequent analysis. In this case, use the COMBINE command to combine
        local solution files into a single, global file.

        ratio in each element plots as a red line, the next largest as green,
        and the smallest as blue.

        COMBIN14, COMBIN39, and MASS21 are displayed with a graphics icon, with
        the offset determined by the real constants and KEYOPT settings.

        BEAM188, BEAM189, PIPE288, PIPE289 and ELBOW290 are displayed as solids
        with the shape determined via the section-definition commands (SECTYPE
        and SECDATA). The arbitrary section option (Subtype = ASEC) has no
        definite shape and appears as a thin rectangle to show orientation. The
        elements are displayed with internal lines representing the cross-
        section mesh.

        SOLID272 and SOLID273 are displayed as solids with the shape determined
        via the section-definition commands (SECTYPE and SECDATA).  The 2-D
        master plane is revolved around the prescribed axis of symmetry.

        Contour plots are available for these elements in postprocessing for
        PowerGraphics only (/GRAPHICS,POWER). To view 3-D deformed shapes for
        the elements, issue OUTRES,MISC or OUTRES,ALL for static or transient
        analyses. To view 3-D mode shapes for a modal or eigenvalue buckling
        analysis, expand the modes with element results calculation ON (Elcalc
        = YES for MXPAND).

        SOURC36, CIRCU124, and TRANS126 elements always plot using /ESHAPE when
        PowerGraphics is activated (/GRAPHICS,POWER).

        In most cases, /ESHAPE renders a thickness representation of your
        shell, plane and layered elements more readily in PowerGraphics
        (/GRAPHICS,POWER). This type of representation employs PowerGraphics to
        generate the enhanced representation, and will often provide no
        enhancement in Full Graphics (/GRAPHICS,FULL). This is especially true
        for POST1 results displays, where /ESHAPE is not supported for most
        element types with FULL graphics.

        When PowerGraphics is active, /ESHAPE may degrade the image if adjacent
        elements have overlapping material, such as shell elements which are
        not co-planar. Additionally, if adjacent elements have different
        thicknesses, the polygons depicting the connectivity between the
        “thicker” and “thinner” elements along the shared element edges may not
        always be displayed.

        For POST1 results displays (such as PLNSOL), the following limitations
        apply:

        Rotational displacements for beam elements are used to create a more
        realistic displacement display. When /ESHAPE is active, displacement
        plots (via PLNSOL,U,X and PLDISP, for example) may disagree with your
        PRNSOL listings. This discrepancy will become more noticeable when the
        SCALE value is not equal to one.

        When shell elements are not co-planar, the resulting PLNSOL display
        with /ESHAPE will actually be a PLESOL display as the non-coincident
        pseudo-nodes are not averaged. Additionally, /ESHAPE should not be used
        with coincident elements because the plot may incorrectly average the
        displacements of the coincident elements.

        When nodes are initially coincident and PowerGraphics is active,
        duplicate polygons are eliminated to conserve display time and disk
        space. The command may degrade the image if initially coincident nodes
        have different displacements. The tolerance for determining coincidence
        is 1E-9 times the model’s bounding box diagonal.

        If you want to view solution results (PLNSOL, etc.) on layered elements
        (such as SHELL181, SOLSH190, SOLID185 Layered Solid, SOLID186 Layered
        Solid, SHELL208, SHELL209, SHELL281, and ELBOW290), set KEYOPT(8) = 1
        for the layer elements so that the data for all layers is stored in the
        results file.

        You can plot the through-thickness temperatures of elements SHELL131
        and SHELL132 regardless of the thermal DOFs in use by issuing the
        PLNSOL,TEMP command (with PowerGraphics and /ESHAPE active).

        The /ESHAPE,1 and /ESHAPE,FAC commands are incompatible with the
        /CYCEXPAND command used in cyclic symmetry analyses.

        Define your data tables as field-variable-dependent (via the
        appropriate TB command shown below), then issue the TBFIELD command to
        define the field values.

        Define data values in ascending order for all field quantities. If a
        field value is to be held constant, define it only once; subsequent
        definitions are ignored.

        There is no limit on the number of values you can specify. The
        specified field value remains active until the next TBFIELD command is
        input.

        After you have defined the field value(s), define your data for the
        data tables (TBDATA).

        See Understanding Field Variables in the Material Reference for more
        information about the interpolation scheme used for field-dependent
        material properties.

        See Full Harmonic Analysis in the Structural Analysis Guide for more
        information about using TBFIELD with TB,ELASTIC or TB,SDAMP.

        The TBFIELD command supports the following material models (TB,Lab
        commands):

        The TEMP value specified on this command corresponds to the average
        temperature on the contact surface for contact elements CONTA171,
        CONTA172, CONTA173, CONTA174, CONTA175, CONTA176, and CONTA177. For
        contact element CONTA178, the TEMP value corresponds to the average
        temperature of the nodes.

        The TIME value specified on this command corresponds to the analysis
        time specified on the TIME command.

        The algebraic sliding distance (SLDA) specified on this command is the
        total sliding distance (the algebraic sum) as reported in the element
        output definitions table for the contact elements (for example, TASS
        and TASR output items for CONTA174).

        The absolute sliding distance (SLDI) specified on this command is the
        total accumulated sliding distance (the absolute sum) as reported in
        the element output definitions table for the contact elements (for
        example, AASS and AASR output items for CONTA174).

        When used with TB,FRIC, field variables defined by TBFIELD are only
        available for isotropic friction (TBOPT = ISO) and orthotropic friction
        (TBOPT = ORTHO); they are not available for user-defined friction

        Parameters
        ----------

            Normal distance key

            ON - Activates normal distance checking.

            OFF - Deactivates normal distance checking (default).

        value
            The normal distance tolerance for surface mapping.  Defaults to
            1.0e-6. If Toler = REL, Value is dimensionless. If Toler = ABS,
            Value has the dimensions of length.

        toler
            Tolerance definition key

            REL - Activates relative gap tolerance, which is independent of units (default).

            ABS - Activates absolute gap tolerance.

        Notes
        -----
        For a dissimilar mesh interface, the nodes of one mesh are mapped to
        the local coordinates of an element in the other mesh. When normal
        distance checking is activated, the mapping tool checks the normal
        distance from the node to the nearest element. The node is considered
        improperly mapped if the normal distance exceeds the tolerance value.
        The mapping tool creates a component to graphically display the
        improperly mapped nodes. See Mapping Diagnostics in the Coupled-Field
        Analysis Guide for more information.

        When using relative gap tolerance (Toler = REL), the normal distance
        tolerance is derived from the product of the relative tolerance Value
        and the largest dimension of the Cartesian bounding box for a specific
        interface. Therefore, each interface will have a different normal
        distance tolerance , even though MFTOL is a global command.

        This command imposes a rigid body motion on the nodes attached to the
        constraint equation or coupled set and makes sure that no internal
        forces are generated for such rigid body motions. Generation of
        internal forces by rigid body motions usually indicates an error in the
        equation specification (possibly due to nodal coordinate rotations).
        The THERM option does a similar check to see that no internal forces
        are created by the equations if the body does a free thermal expansion
        (this check assumes a single isotropic coefficient of expansion).

            Accumulation key:

            REPL - Subsequent values replace the previous values (default).

            ADD - Subsequent values are added to the previous values.

            IGNO - Subsequent values are ignored.

        rfact
            Scale factor for the real component.  Zero (or blank) defaults to
            1.0.  Use a small number for a zero scale factor.

        ifact
            Scale factor for the imaginary component.  Zero (or blank) defaults
            to 1.0.  Use a small number for a zero scale factor.

        tbase
            Base temperature for temperature difference.  Used only with
            temperature degree of freedom.  Scale factor is applied to the
            temperature difference (T-TBASE) and then added to TBASE.  T is the
            current temperature.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows repeated degree of freedom constraint values (displacement,
        temperature, etc.)  to be replaced, added, or ignored.  Operations
        apply to the selected nodes [NSEL] and the selected degree of freedom
        labels [DOFSEL]. This command also operates on velocity and
        acceleration loads applied in a structural analysis.

        The operations occur when the next degree of freedom constraints are
        defined.  For example, issuing the command D,1,UX,.025 after a previous
        D,1,UX,.020 causes the new value of the displacement on node 1 in the
        x-direction to be 0.045 with the add operation, 0.025 with the replace
        operation, or 0.020 with the ignore operation.  Scale factors are also
        available to multiply the next value before the add or replace
        operation.  A scale factor of 2.0 with the previous "add" example
        results in a displacement of 0.070.  Scale factors are applied even if
        no previous values exist.  Issue DCUM,STAT to show the current label,
        operation, and scale factors.  Solid model boundary conditions are not
        affected by this command, but boundary conditions on the FE model are
        affected.

        Note:: : FE boundary conditions may still be overwritten by existing
        solid model boundary conditions if a subsequent boundary condition
        transfer occurs.

        DCUM does not work for tabular boundary conditions.

        Specifies adaptive meshing controls for an explicit dynamic analysis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        freq
            Time interval between adaptive mesh refinements (default = 0.0).
            Use FREQ = STAT to list the current adaptive meshing control
            settings.

        tol
            Adaptive angle tolerance (in degrees) for which adaptive meshing
            will occur (default = 1e31). If the relative angle change between
            elements exceeds the specified tolerance value, the elements will
            be refined.

        opt
            Adaptivity option:

            1 - Angle change (in degrees) of elements is based on original mesh configuration
                (default).

            2 - Angle change (in degrees) of elements is incrementally based on previously
                refined mesh.

        maxlvl
            Maximum number of mesh refinement levels (default = 3). This
            parameter controls the number of times an element can be remeshed.
            Values of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. allow a maximum of 1, 4, 16, 64, etc.
            elements, respectively, to be created for each original element.

        btime
            Birth time to begin adaptive meshing (default = 0.0).

        dtime
            Death time to end adaptive meshing (default = 1e31).

        lcid
            Data curve number (previously defined on the EDCURVE command)
            identifying the interval of remeshing (no default). The abscissa of
            the data curve is time, and the ordinate is the varied adaptive
            time interval. If LCID is nonzero, the adaptive frequency (FREQ) is
            replaced by this load curve. Note that a nonzero FREQ value is
            still required to initiate the first adaptive loop.

        adpsize
            Minimum element size to be adapted based on element edge length
            (default = 0.0).

        adpass
            One or two pass adaptivity option.

            0 - Two pass adaptivity (default).

            1 - One pass adaptivity.

        ireflg
            Uniform refinement level flag (no default). Values of 1, 2, 3, etc.
            allow 4, 16, 64, etc. elements, respectively, to be created
            uniformly for each original element.

        adpene
            Adaptive mesh flag for starting adaptivity when approaching
            (positive ADPENE value) or penetrating (negative ADPENE value) the
            tooling surface (default = 0.0).

        adpth
            Absolute shell thickness level below which adaptivity should begin.
            This option works only if the adaptive angle tolerance (TOL) is
            nonzero. If thickness based adaptive remeshing is desired without
            angle change, set TOL to a large angle. The default is ADPTH = 0.0,
            which means this option is not used.

        maxel
            Maximum number of elements at which adaptivity will be terminated
            (no default). Adaptivity is stopped if this number of elements is
            exceeded.

        Notes
        -----
        The EDCADAPT command globally sets the control options for all part IDs
        that are to be adaptively meshed (see the EDADAPT command). Because
        FREQ defaults to zero, you must input a nonzero value in this field in
        order to activate adaptive meshing. You must also specify a reasonable
        value for TOL since the default adaptive angle tolerance (1e31) will
        not allow adaptive meshing to occur.

        The EDCADAPT command is not supported in an explicit dynamic full
        restart analysis (EDSTART,3).

        active coordinate system before summing and printing. The FORCE command
        can be used to specify which component (static, damping, inertia, or
        total) of the nodal load is to be used. This command output is included
        in the NFORCE command.

        The command should not be used with axisymmetric elements because it
        might calculate a moment where none exists. Consider, for example, the
        axial load on a pipe modeled with an axisymmetric shell element.  The
        reaction force on the end of the pipe is the total force (for the full
        360 degrees) at that location. The net moment about the centerline of
        the pipe would be zero, but the program would incorrectly calculate a
        moment at the end of the element as the force multiplied by the radius.

        The command is not valid for elements that operate solely within the
        nodal coordinate system with 1-D option activated and rotated nodes
        (NROTAT).

        APDL Command: LSSCALE

        Parameters
        ----------
        nl1, nl2, ninc
            Set of lines (NL1 to NL2 in steps of NINC) that defines the pattern
            to be scaled.  NL2 defaults to NL1, NINC defaults to 1.  If NL1 =

        rx, ry, rz
            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, Z keypoint coordinates in
            active coordinate system (RR, Rθ, RZ for cylindrical; RR, Rθ, RΦ
            for spherical).  Note that the Rθ and RΦ scale factors are
            interpreted as angular offsets.  For example, for CSYS,1, RR, Rθ,
            RZ input of (1.5,10,3) would scale the specified keypoints 1.5
            times in the radial and 3 times in the Z direction, while adding an
            offset of 10 degrees to the keypoints.  Zero, blank, or negative
            scale factor values are assumed to be 1.0.  Zero or blank angular
            offsets have no effect.

        kinc
            Increment to be applied to keypoint numbers for generated set.  If
            zero, the lowest available keypoint numbers will be assigned
            [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            0 - Nodes and line elements associated with the original lines will be generated
                (scaled) if they exist.

            1 - Nodes and line elements will not be generated.

        imove
            Specifies whether lines will be moved or newly defined:

            0 - Additional lines will be generated.

            1 - Original lines will be moved to new position (KINC and NOELEM are ignored).
                Use only if the old lines are no longer needed at their
                original positions.  Corresponding meshed items are also moved

        Defines a body force load (such as temperature in a structural

        the BFTRAN or SBCTRAN commands.  Interpolation will be used to apply
        loads to the nodes on the lines between keypoints.  All keypoints on a
        given area (or volume) must have the same BFK specification, with the
        same values, for the loads to be transferred to interior nodes in the
        area (or volume).  If only one keypoint on a line has a BFK

                   command (where N refers to a layer number), the results
                   appear in the layer coordinate system. (SOLU is the default
                   for spectrum analyses.)

            LSYS - Layer coordinate system. For layered shell and solid elements, the results
                   appear in their respective layer coordinate systems.  For a
                   specific layer of interest, issue a LAYER,N command (where N
                   refers to a layer number). If a model has both nonlayered
                   and layered elements, you can use RSYS,SOLU and RSYS,LSYS
                   simultaneously (with RSYS,SOLU applicable to nonlayered
                   elements and RSYS,LSYS applicable to layered elements).  To
                   reverse effects of the LSYS option, issue an RSYS,0 command.
                   LSYS is the default for spectrum analysis.

        Notes
        -----
        The RSYS command activates a coordinate system for printing or
        displaying element results data such as stresses and heat fluxes, and
        nodal results data such as degrees of freedom and reactions. ANSYS
        rotates the results data to the specified coordinate system during
        printout, display, or element table operations (such as PRNSOL, PRESOL,
        PLNSOL, and ETABLE). You can define coordinate systems with various
        ANSYS commands such as LOCAL, CS, CLOCAL, and CSKP.

        If you issue RSYS with KCN > 10 (indicating a local coordinate system),
        and the specified system is subsequently redefined, you must reissue
        RSYS for results to be rotated into the redefined system.

        Note:: : The default coordinate system for certain elements, notably
        shells, is not global Cartesian and is frequently not aligned at
        adjacent elements.

        The use of RSYS,SOLU with these elements can make nodal averaging of
        component element results, such as SX, SY, SZ, SXY, SYZ, and SXZ,
        invalid and is not recommended.

        The RSYS command has no effect on beam or pipe stresses, which ANSYS
        displays (via /ESHAPE,1 and PowerGraphics) in the element coordinate
        system.

        Element results such as stresses and heat fluxes are in the element
        coordinate systems when KCN = SOLU. Nodal requests for element results
        (for example, PRNSOL,S,COMP) average the element values at the common
        node; that is, the orientation of the node is not a factor in the
        output of element quantities.  For nearly all solid elements, the
        default element coordinate systems are parallel to the global Cartesian
        coordinate system. For shell elements and the remaining solid elements,
        the default element coordinate system can differ from element to
        element. For layered shell and layered solid elements, ANSYS initially
        selects the element coordinate system when KCN = SOLU; you can then
        select the layer coordinate system via the LAYER command.

        Nodal results such as degrees of freedom and reactions can be properly
        rotated only if the resulting component set is consistent with the
        degree-of-freedom set at the node. (The degree-of-freedom set at a node
        is determined by the elements attached to the node.) For example, if a
        node does not have a UZ degree of freedom during solution, then any Z
        component resulting from a rotation does not print or display in POST1.
        Therefore, results at nodes with a single degree-of-freedom (UY only,
        for example) should not be rotated; that is, they should be viewed only
        in the nodal coordinate system or a system parallel to the nodal
        system. (The global Cartesian system--the RSYS command default--may not
        be parallel to the nodal system.) Results at nodes with a 2-D degree-
        of-freedom set (UX and UY, for example) should not be rotated out of
        the 2-D plane.

        PowerGraphics

        For PowerGraphics, ANSYS plots PLVECT vector arrow displays (such
        temperature, velocity, and force) in the global Cartesian coordinate
        system (RSYS = 0). Subsequent operations revert to your original
        coordinate system.

        PGR File

        When you generate a .PGR file in SOLUTION, you can use the Results
        Viewer to display your stresses only in the coordinate system in which
        you write your .PGR file. To view stresses in other coordinate systems,
        load your results file into the Results Viewer and regenerate the data.

        Large Deflections

        If large deflection is active (NLGEOM,ON), ANSYS rotates the element
        component result directions by the amount of rigid body rotation.

        ANSYS displays the element component results in the initial global
        coordinate system for the following elements: SHELL181, SHELL281,
        ELBOW290, PLANE182, PLANE183, SOLID185, SOLID186, SOLID187, SOLID272,
        SOLID273, SOLID285, SOLSH190, SHELL208, and SHELL209. All other element
        result transformations are, therefore, also relative to the initial
        global system. Nodal degree-of-freedom results are based on the initial
        (and not the updated) geometry. For all other element types, component
        results displayed in the co-rotated coordinate system include the
        element rigid body rotation from the initial global coordinate system,
        and all other element result transformations are relative to the
        rotated global system.

        LS-DYNA

        You can use the RSYS command to rotate stress data for all explicit
        (ANSYS LS-DYNA) elements except BEAM161, COMBI165, and composite
        SHELL163 (KEYOPT(3) = 1). In models that contain these element types
        combined with other explicit elements, you must unselect the
        unsupported elements before issuing the RSYS command. The command does
        not support strain data for any explicit element types. If you request
        strain results for explicit elements when RSYS is not set to the global
        Cartesian coordinate system (KCN = 0), ANSYS ignores the printing or
        plotting command. (ANSYS always rotates displacements into the results
        coordinate system, independent of the explicit element type.)

        APDL Command: PRSECT

        Calculates and prints linearized stresses along a section path.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rho
            In-plane (X-Y) average radius of curvature of the inside and
            outside surfaces of an axisymmetric section.  If zero (or blank), a
            plane or 3-D structure is assumed.  If nonzero, an axisymmetric
            structure is assumed.  Use any large number (or -1) for an
            axisymmetric straight section.

        kbr
            Through-thickness bending stresses key for an axisymmetric analysis
            (RHO  ≠ 0):

            0 - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses.

            1 - Ignore the thickness-direction bending stresses.

            2 - Include the thickness-direction bending stress using the same formula as the Y
                (axial direction ) bending stress. Also use the same formula
                for the shear stress.

        Notes
        -----
        You may choose to linearize the stresses through a section and separate
        them into categories for various code calculations.  PRSECT calculates
        and reports linearized stresses along a section path.  The linearized
        stresses are also separated into membrane, bending, membrane plus
        bending, peak, and total stress categories.

        First, define your section path using the PATH and PPATH (with the NODE
        option) commands.  Your path must lie entirely within the selected set
        of elements (that is, there must be no element gaps along the path).
        PATH and PPATH are used only to retrieve the two end nodes.  The path
        data is not retained.  The section path is defined by the two end
        nodes, and by 47 intermediate points that are automatically determined
        by linear interpolation in the active display coordinate system [DSYS].
        The number and location of the intermediate points are not affected by
        the number of divisions set by PATH,,,,nDiv.

        Your  linearized component stress values are obtained by interpolating
        each element’s  average corner nodal values along the section path
        points within each path element.  PRSECT reports the linearized
        component and principal stresses for each stress category at the
        beginning, mid-length, and end of the section path.  PRPATH can be used
        to report the total stresses at the intermediate points.

        Section paths may be through any set of solid (2-D plane, 2-D
        axisymmetric or 3-D) elements.  However, section paths are usually
        defined to be through the thickness of the structure and normal to the
        inner and outer structure surfaces.  Section paths (in-plane only) may
        also be defined for shell element structures.  See the Mechanical APDL
        Theory Reference for details.

        If the RHO option is set to indicate the axisymmetric option (non-
        zero), PRSECT reports the linearized stresses in the section
        coordinates (SX – along the path, SY – normal to the path, and SZ –
        hoop direction).  If the RHO option is set to indicate the 2-D planar
        or 3-D option (zero or blank), PRSECT reports the linearized stresses
        in the active results coordinate system [RSYS].  If the RHO option is
        zero or blank and either RSYS, SOLU or RSYS, -1 are active, the
        linearized stresses are calculated and reported in the global Cartesian
        coordinate system.  It is recommended that linearized stress
        calculations be performed in a rectangular coordinate system.
        Principal stresses are recalculated from the component stresses and are
        invariant with the coordinate system as long as SX is in the same
        direction at all points along the defined path.  The PLSECT command
        displays the linearized stresses in the same coordinate system as
        reported by PRSECT.

        Stress components through the section are linearized by a line integral
        method and separated into constant membrane stresses, bending stresses
        varying linearly between end points, and peak stresses (defined as the
        difference between the actual (total) stress and the membrane plus
        bending combination).

        For nonaxisymmetric structures,  the bending stresses are calculated
        such that the neutral axis is at the midpoint of the path.
        Axisymmetric results include the effects of both the radius of
        revolution (automatically determined from the node locations) and the
        in-plane average radius of curvature of the section surfaces (user
        input).

        For axisymmetric cases, Mechanical APDL calculates the linearized
        bending stress in the through-thickness direction as the difference
        between the total outer fiber stress and the membrane stress if KBR =
        1. The calculation method may be conservative for locations with a
        highly nonlinear variation of stress in the through-thickness
        direction.  Alternatively, you can specify KBR = 2 to calculate the
        bending stress using the same method and formula as the Y (axial
        direction) bending stress. For more information, see the discussion of
        axisymmetric cases (specifically Equation: 17–40) in the Mechanical
        APDL Theory Reference.

        APDL Command: EDCURVE

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Label identifying the option to be performed.

            ADD - Define a data curve (default). If Option = ADD, Par1 and Par2 must be
                  previously defined array parameters.

            DELE - Delete the specified data curve (LCID). If LCID is blank, all data curves are
                   deleted. Par1 and Par2 are ignored for this option.

            LIST - List defined data curve (LCID). If LCID is blank, all data curves are listed.
                   Par1 and Par2 are ignored for this option.

            PLOT - Plot defined data curve (LCID). If Option = PLOT, LCID must be previously
                   defined with an EDCURVE command. Otherwise a warning message
                   will report that LCID has not been defined. Par1 and Par2
                   are ignored for this option.

        lcid
            Data curve ID number (no default). Must be a positive integer.

        par1
            Name of user-defined array parameter that contains the abscissa
            values of the curve data (e.g., time, effective plastic strain,
            effective strain rate, displacement, etc.).

        par2
            Name of user-defined array parameter that contains the ordinate
            values of the curve data (e.g., damping coefficients, initial yield
            stress, elastic modulus, force, etc.) corresponding to the abscissa
            values in Par1.

        Notes
        -----
        EDCURVE can be used to define material data curves (e.g., stress-
        strain) and load data curves (force-deflection) associated with
        material models in an explicit dynamics analysis. Material data
        specified by this command is typically required to define a particular
        material behavior (e.g., TB,HONEY), and the LCID number is used as
        input on the TBDATA command.

        EDCURVE can also be used to define load curves that represent time
        dependent loads (force, displacement, velocity, etc.). Par1 must
        contain the time values, and Par2 must contain the corresponding load
        values. The LCID number assigned to the load curve can be used as input
        on the EDLOAD command.

        Note:: : You cannot update a previously defined data curve by changing
        the array parameters that were input as Par1 and Par2. The data curve
        definition is written to the database at the time EDCURVE is issued.
        Therefore, subsequent changes to the array parameters that were used as
        input on EDCURVE will not affect the load curve definition. If you need
        to change the load curve definition, you must delete the load curve
        (EDCURVE,DELE,LCID) and define it again.

        LCID identifies the data curve. If the value input for LCID is the same
        as the ID number for a data curve previously defined by EDCURVE, the
        previous data will be overwritten. Use EDCURVE,LIST and EDCURVE,PLOT to
        check existing data curves.

        A starting array element number must be specified for Par1 and Par2.
        The input for these fields must be a single column array parameter, or
        a specific column from a multi-column array parameter. When using the
        GUI with multi-column parameters, you must specify the parameter name
        and starting position for Par1 and Par2 by typing the EDCURVE command
        in the Input Window. This is because only the parameter name is
        available through the dialog box, which pulls in the first position of
        a single-column array parameter.

        If you need to change a curve definition in an explicit dynamic small
        restart analysis, issue EDSTART,2 first (to specify the restart), then
        issue the EDCURVE command. The revised curve must contain the same
        number of points as the curve it replaces. This limitation does not
        apply to a full restart analysis (EDSTART,3).

        APDL Command: PDDMCS

        Specifies options for Monte Carlo Simulations using direct sampling.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nsim
            Number of simulation loops of the analysis.

        --
            Unused field.

        astop
            Autostop option label.

            AUTO - Enable Autostop. When Autostop is used, the PDS feature continues the
                   simulation loops until the convergence criteria for the mean
                   value and the standard deviation have been met or until the
                   number of simulations NSIM are complete, whichever comes
                   first. The convergence criteria (mean value and standard
                   deviations of all random output parameters) are specified by
                   the ACCMEAN and ACCSTDEV parameters. The criteria are met if
                   the mean value and the standard deviations converge within
                   the accuracy specified in the ACCMEAN and ACCSTDEV options.
                   The convergence check is done every i-th loop, where i is
                   specified in the CHECK parameter.

            ALL - Disable Autostop option. All Monte Carlo Simulations as specified by NSIM are
                  performed (default).

        accmean
            Accuracy of the mean values of all random output parameters that
            must be met for the Autostop option. Default is 0.01 (1%). ACCMEAN
            is ignored for Astop = ALL. The convergence of the mean values is
            met if for all random output parameters y the equation holds:

        accstdev
            Accuracy of the standard deviations of all random output parameters
            that must be met for the Autostop option. The default is 0.02 (2%).
            ACCSTDEV is ignored for Astop = ALL. The convergence for the
            standard deviations is met if for all random output parameters y
            the equation holds:

        check
            Sets how often conditions for convergence are checked for Autostop.
            The PDS checks if the convergence criteria are met every i-th loop,
            where i is given by the CHECK parameter. The default value is 10.
            It is not recommended to use CHECK = 1, because it could cause
            Autostop to terminate the simulations prematurely. The mean values
            and standard deviation might not show large differences between
            consecutive simulation loops but might still have a visible
            "global" trend if viewed over several simulations. This behavior
            indicates that convergence has not really been achieved. If you set
            CHECK = 1 (or another small number), then Autostop is not able to
            detect such a global trend. CHECK is ignored for Astop = ALL.

        seed
            Seed value label. Random number generators require a seed value
            that is used to calculate the next random number. After each random
            number generation finishes, the seed value is updated and is used
            again to calculate the next random number. ANSYS initializes the
            seed value with the system time when the ANSYS session started.

            CONT - Continues updating using the derived seed value (default).

            TIME - Initializes the seed value with the system time. You can use this if you want
                   the seed value set to a specific value for one analysis and
                   then you want to continue with a "random" seed in the next
                   analysis. It is not recommended to "randomize" the seed
                   value with the Seed = TIME option for multiple analyses. If
                   the Monte Carlo simulations requested with this command will
                   be appended to previously existing simulations, then the
                   Seed option is ignored and Seed = CONT is used.

            INIT - Initializes the seed value using 123457 (a typical recommendation). This option
                   leads to identical random numbers for all random input
                   variables when the exact analysis will be repeated, making
                   it useful for benchmarking and validation purposes (where
                   identical random numbers are desired). If the Monte Carlo
                   simulations requested with this command will be appended to
                   previously existing simulations, then the Seed option is
                   ignored and Seed = CONT is used.

            Value - Uses the specified (positive) value for the initialization of the seed value.
                    This option has the same effect as Seed = INIT, except you
                    can chose an arbitrary (positive) number for the
                    initialization. If the Monte Carlo simulations requested
                    with this command will be appended to previously existing
                    simulations, then the Seed option is ignored and Seed =
                    CONT is used.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines the number of simulations, the specification of the Autostop
        option, how frequently the Autostop option is checked and the seed
        value for random number generation. If the Autostop option is enabled,
        then the number of simulations given for NSIM can be regarded as the
        maximum number of simulations to be performed. The Autostop option may
        terminate the simulations before NSIM simulations are done if the
        convergence criteria are met.

        Calculates modal assurance criterion (MAC) and matches nodal solutions
        from two results files or from one results file and one universal
        format file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file1
            File name (32 characters maximum) corresponding to the first
            results file (.rst or .rstp file). If the file name does not
            contain the extension, it defaults to .rst.

        lstep1
            Load step number of the results to be read in File1.

            N  - Reads load step N. Defaults to 1.

        sbstep1
            Substep number of the results to be read in File1.

            N  - Reads substep N.

            All  - Reads all substeps. This value is the default.

        file2
            File name (32 characters maximum) corresponding to the second file
            (.rst, .rstp, or .unv file). If the file name does not contain the
            extension, it defaults to .rst.

        lstep2
            Load step number of the results to be read in File2.

            N  - Reads load step N. Defaults to 1.

        sbstep2
            Substep number of the results to be read in File2.

            N  - Reads substep N.

            All  - Reads all substeps. This value is the default.

        tolern
            Tolerance for nodes matching. If TolerN = -1, the nodes on File2
            are mapped into the selected elements of File1. If TolerN is
            positive, the selected nodes of File1 are matched to the nodes of
            File2. The default value is 0.01.

        maclim
            Smallest acceptable MAC value. Must be  0 and  1. The default value
            is 0.90.

        cname
            Name of the component from the first file (File1). The component
            must be based on nodes. If unspecified, all nodes are matched and
            used for MAC calculations. If a component name is specified, only
            nodes included in the specified component are used. Not applicable
            to node mapping (TolerN=-1).

        keyprint
            Printout options:

            0  - Printout matched solutions table. This value is the default.

            1  - Printout matched solutions table and full MAC table.

            2  - Printout matched solutions table, full MAC table and matched nodes table.

        unvscale
            Scaling of the nodal coordinates when File2 is a universal format
            file (.unv).

            Blank or 0  - No scaling (default).

            Non-zero value  - Scaling factor applied to the nodal coordinates.

        keymass
            Key to include the mass matrix diagonal in the calculations.

            ON  - Include the mass matrix diagonal. This is the default.

            OFF  - Do not include the mass matrix diagonal.

        Notes
        -----
        The RSTMAC command allows the comparison of the solutions from either:

        Two different results files

        One result file and one universal format file

        The modal assurance criterion (MAC) is used.

        The meshes read on File1 and File2 may be different. If TolerN>0, the
        nodes are matched. This is the default. If TolerN = -1, the nodes are
        mapped and the solutions are interpolated from File1.

        Units and coordinate systems must be the same for both models. When a
        universal format file is used, the nodal coordinates can be scaled
        using UNVscale.

        The corresponding database file (.db) for File1 must be resumed before
        running the command only if a component (Cname) is used or if the nodes
        are mapped (TolerN = -1).

        Results may be real or complex; however, if results from File1 have a
        different type from results in File2, only the real parts of the
        solutions are taken into account in MAC calculations. The analysis type
        can be arbitrary.

        Only structural degrees of freedom are considered. Degrees of freedom
        can vary between File1 and File2, but at least one common degree of
        freedom must exist.

        When node mapping and solution interpolation is performed (TolerN=-1),
        File1 must correspond to a model meshed in solid and/or shell elements.
        Other types of elements can be present but the node mapping is not
        performed for those elements. Interpolation is performed on UX, UY, and
        UZ degrees of freedom.

        The solutions read on the results files are not all written to the
        database, therefore, subsequent plotting or printing of solutions is
        not possible.  A SET command must be issued after the RSTMAC command to
        post-process each solution.

        RSTMAC comparison on cyclic symmetry analysis works only if the number
        of sectors on File1 and File2 are the same. Also comparison cannot be
        made between cyclic symmetry results and full 360 degree model results
        (File1 – cyclic solution, File2 – full 360 degree model solution).
        Comparing cyclic symmetry solutions written on selected set of node
        (OUTRES) is not supported.

        The modal assurance criterion values can be retrieved as parameters
        using the *GET command (Entity = RSTMAC).

        Two Models (RSTMAC) in the Basic Analysis Guide.

                           load step. The forces are ramped from the reaction
                           forces of the previous load step, regardless of

        Use THEXPAND,OFF to evaluate the material properties but not contribute
        to the load vector. This capability is particularly useful when

        Calculates the relative error in an electrostatic or electromagnetic

        Notes
        -----
        The relative error is an approximation of the mesh discretization error
        associated with a solution. It is based on the discrepancy between the
        unaveraged, element-nodal field values and the averaged, nodal field
        values. The calculation is valid within a material boundary and does
        not consider the error in continuity of fields across dissimilar
        materials.

        For electrostatics, the field values evaluated are the electric field
        strength (EFSUM) and the electric flux density (DSUM). A relative error
        norm of each is calculated on a per-element basis and stored in the
        element table [ETABLE] with the labels EF_ERR and D_ERR. Normalized
        error values EFN_ERR and DN_ERR are also calculated and stored in the
        element table. Corresponding quantities for electromagnetics are H_ERR,
        B_ERR, HN_ERR, and BN_ERR, which are calculated from the magnetic field
        intensity (HSUM) and the magnetic flux density (BSUM).  The normalized
        error value is the relative error norm value divided by the peak
        element-nodal field value for the currently selected elements.

        Use the PLETAB and PRETAB commands to plot and list the error norms and
        normalized error values.

        Notes
        -----
        Displays the solution results as element contours discontinuous across
        element boundaries for the selected elements.  For example, PLESOL,S,X
        displays the X component of stress S (that is, the SX stress
        component).  Various element results depend on the calculation method
        and the selected results location (AVPRIN, RSYS, and ESEL).  Contours
        are determined by linear interpolation within each element, unaffected
        by the surrounding elements (i.e., no nodal averaging is performed).
        The discontinuity between contours of adjacent elements is an
        indication of the gradient across elements.  Component results are

            Node J of gap (must be different from NODE1).  Non-grounded gap
            nodes must be defined as master degrees of freedom or be
            unconstrained, active DOF in a full analysis type.  Grounded gap
            nodes (those not defined as MDOF) need not appear elsewhere in the
            model.

        lab
            Direction of gap action in the nodal coordinate system (implied
            from the following force labels): FX, FY, FZ, MX, MY, MZ.

        stif
            Stiffness (Force/Length) of closed gap (may be positive or
            negative).

        gap
            Initial size of gap.  A zero (or positive) value assumes an
            initially open gap.  A negative value defines an interference
            condition.  For a rotational gap, GAP should be in radians.

        damp
            Damping coefficient (Force*Time/Length) of closed gap using pseudo
            velocity (Newmark finite difference expansion scheme).

        Notes
        -----
        Defines a gap condition for the mode superposition transient analysis
        (ANTYPE,TRANS with TRNOPT,MSUP). If used in SOLUTION, this command is
        valid only within the first load step. Gap conditions specified in
        subsequent load steps are ignored.

        Repeat GP command for additional gap conditions. Gaps are numbered
        sequentially as input.

        Note:: : Gaps may be renumbered by the program during the solution (see
        output listing)

        The mode-superposition transient analysis does not allow gap action
        with the standard gap elements. However, you can define gap conditions
        which are similar to gap elements; gap conditions can be specified
        between surfaces that are expected to contact (impact) each other
        during the transient. The gap condition simulates the basic gap action
        of the COMBIN40 element.

        The gap condition is treated as an explicit force (equal to the
        interference times contact stiffness) and affects only the load vector
        calculation and not the stiffness matrix. The interference is
        calculated from the displacement extrapolated from the previous time
        points.

        Gap conditions can only be defined between two master degree of freedom
        (DOF) nodes or between master DOF nodes and ground, as shown in the
        following figure.

        Master degrees of freedom are the unconstrained and active degrees of
        freedom. Gap nodes not defined as active degrees of freedom or attached
        to an element are assumed to be grounded. Grounded gap nodes do not
        need a spatial location, nor do they need to be located on an element.

        Gap conditions may be defined in parallel (across the same nodes), with
        varying gap and stiffness values, to simulate a nonlinear (piecewise)
        force-deflection curve.

        The gap direction is determined from the force label input on the GP
        command; i.e., FX defines a translational gap acting in the UX nodal
        degree of freedom direction, and MZ defines a rotational gap acting in
        the nodal ROTZ degree of freedom direction. The actual degree of
        freedom directions available for a particular node depends upon the
        degrees of freedom associated with the element types [ET] at that node.

        If the coordinate systems of the nodes connecting the gap are rotated
        relative to each other, the same degree of freedom may be in different
        directions. The gap, however, assumes only a one-dimensional action.
        Nodes I and J may be anywhere in space (preferably coincident).  No
        moment effects are included due to noncoincident nodes. That is, if the
        nodes are offset from the line of action, moment equilibrium may not be
        satisfied.

        The contact stiffness value represents the stiffness of the closed gap.
        Stiffness values are related to the integration time step size and
        should be physically reasonable. High stiffness will require a small
        integration time step; otherwise, due to the displacement
        extrapolation, the solution may go unstable. Negative stiffness values
        may be used with gaps in parallel to produce a decreasing force-
        deflection curve.

        The order of specifying the gap nodes is important; i.e., a gap
        condition connecting two nodes will act differently depending upon
        which node is specified first on the GP command.  For example, for Node
        1 at X = 0.0, Node 2 at X = 0.1, and the gap defined from Node 1 to 2,
        a displacement of Node 1 greater than Node 2 will cause the gap to
        close.  For the gap defined from Node 2 to 1, a displacement of Node 2
        greater than Node 1 will cause the gap to close (like a hook action).
        In general, the gap closes whenever the separation (defined as UJ - UI
        + GAP) is negative.  UJ is the displacement of node J, UI is the
        displacement of node I, and GAP is the input gap value.  The gap force
        output appears in the printout only for the time steps for which the
        gap is closed.  A negative spring force is always associated with a
        closed gap (even with the hook option).

        Some guidelines to define gap conditions are presented below:

        Use enough gap conditions to obtain a smooth contact stress
        distribution between the contacting surfaces.

        Define a reasonable gap stiffness. If the stiffness is too low, the
        contacting surfaces may overlap too much. If the stiffness is too high,
        a very small time step will be required during impact. A general
        recommendation is to specify a gap stiffness that is one or two orders
        of magnitude higher than the adjacent element stiffness. You can
        estimate the adjacent element stiffness using AE/L, where A is the
        contributing area around the gap condition, E is the elastic modulus of
        the softer material at the interface, and L is the depth of the first
        layer of elements at the interface.

        A mode-superposition transient using the nonlinear gap damping provided
        through the DAMP field runs faster than a full transient analysis using
        a gap element (COMBIN40).

        Use the GPLIST command to list gap conditions and the GPDELE command to
        delete gap conditions.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        APDL Command: EEXTRUDE

        Extrudes 2-D plane elements into 3-D solids.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action
            Specifies one of the following command behaviors:

            AUTO - Extrudes plane elements (PLANE182 and PLANE183) based on the KEYOPT(3) setting.
                   Complementary elements are also extruded. (See Notes for
                   more information.) This behavior is the default.

            PLANE - Extrudes elements in the global Z direction. KEYOPT(3) of the parent elements
                    is ignored.

            AXIS - Extrudes elements about the global Y axis. KEYOPT(3) of the parent elements is
                   ignored.

            TANGENT - Similar to Action = AXIS, except that target elements are extruded in the
                      global Z direction.

        nelem
            Number of elements to generate in the extruded direction. If you do
            not specify a number, the program calculates a number automatically
            based on the average element size and extrusion distance.

        space
            Spacing ratio. If positive, this value is the nominal ratio of the
            last division size to the first division size (if > 1.0, sizes
            increase, if < 1.0, sizes decrease). If negative, |SPACE| is the
            nominal ratio of the center division size to the end division size.
            The default value is 1.0 (uniform spacing).

        dist
            Distance to extrude in the global Z direction for the plane strain
            case (Action = PLANE). The default is 1.

        theta
            Ending angle (in degrees) to extrude about the global Y axis for
            the axisymmetric case (Action = AXIS). The beginning angle is
            always 0 degrees. The ending angle defaults to 360 degrees.

        tfact
            Factor for increasing the rigid target size. The size of the
            extruded rigid target elements is determined automatically based on
            the size of the contact elements. The default value is 0.2.

        Notes
        -----
        The EEXTRUDE command extrudes current-technology elements PLANE182 and
        PLANE183. Complementary elements TARGE169, CONTA171, CONTA172, and
        REINF263 will also extrude. Extrusion operates automatically on
        elements in the selected element set.

        For automatic PLANE182 and PLANE183 extrusion (Action = AUTO), based on
        the element behavior of the plane elements, the command performs as
        follows:

        Plane stress; the element is ignored.

        Axisymmetric; the element is extruded 360 degrees about the Y-axis.
        THETA is ignored.

        Plane strain (Z strain = 0.0); the element is extruded a unit distance
        in the global Z direction.

        Plane stress with thickness input; the element is extruded in the
        Z-direction as specified by the thickness input via a real constant.

        Generalized plane strain; the element is ignored.

        For an axisymmetric extrusion (Action = AUTO with KEYOPT(3) = 1, Action
        = AXIS, or Action = TANGENT), the command merges any nodes within the
        specified tolerance (SELTOL,TOLER) of the axis into a single node, then
        forms degenerate tetrahedrons, pyramids, or wedges. The default
        tolerance value is 1.0E-6.

        When issuing the EEXTRUDE command within the MAP2DTO3D environment
        using KEYOPT(3) = 3, mapping results do not provide the correct 3-D
        results state; therefore, KEYOPT(3) = 3 is suggested only as a tool for
        extruding the mesh itself as a geometric feature.

        For an axisymmetric extrusion, SHELL208 and SHELL209 will extrude.

        You can control shape-checking options via the SHPP command.

        The extrusion behavior of accompanying contact (CONTA171 and CONTA172)
        is determined by the plane element settings. Rigid target (TARGE169)
        elements are extruded in the global Z direction unless axisymmetric
        extrusion (Action = AXIS) is in effect.

        The following table shows each 2-D element capable of extrusion and its
        corresponding post-extrusion 3-D element:

        All element properties are also transferred consistently during
        extrusion. For example, a  2-D element is extruded to a  3-D element,
        and a mixed u-P 2-D element is extruded to a mixed u-P 3-D element.

        Activates the arc-length method and sets the minimum and maximum
        multipliers for controlling the arc-length radius based on the initial
        arc-length radius.

        The initial arc-length radius, t0, is proportional (in absolute value)
        to the initial load factor. The initial load factor is given by:

        Initial Load Factor = TIME / NSBSTP

        where TIME is the time specified by the TIME command for the arc-length
        load step, and NSBSTP is the number of substeps specified by the NSUBST
        command.

        The factors MAXARC and MINARC are used to define the range for the arc-
        length radius to expand and shrink during the substep solution:

        In each substep, the arc-length radius is kept constant throughout the
        equilibrium iterations. After each converged substep, the arc-length
        radius for the next substep is modified depending on the convergence
        behavior. If the substep converges and the program heuristic predicts
        an easy convergence, the arc-length radius is enlarged. If the enlarged
        value is greater than tMAX, the arc-length radius is reset to tMAX. If
        the substep does not converge, bisection will take place until the arc-
        length radius is reduced to tMIN. If further nonconvergence is
        encountered, the solution terminates.

        The arc-length method predicts the next time increment (that is, load
        factor increment). Therefore, the AUTOTS and PRED commands are ignored

        The STABILIZE and LNSRCH commands are also ignored.

        The arc-length method cannot be used in a multiframe restart.

        For difficult problems, one suggestion is to increase the initial
        number of substeps (NSUBST), and to prevent the arc-length radius from
        increasing too rapidly (MAXARC = 1).

        ARCLEN cannot be used for any load step that has no applied load or
        displacement.

        The arc-length method does not support tabular loads. In order to use
        the arc-length method, you must replace tabular loads by other load
        types and then run the analysis again.

        cm_name
            The name of the element component.

        omegax, omegay, omegaz
            If the X2, Y2, Z2 fields are not defined, OMEGAX, OMEGAY, and

        -----
        Specifies the rotational velocity components OMEGAX, OMEGAY, and OMEGAZ
        of an element component CM_NAME about a user-defined rotational axis.
        The rotational axis can be defined either as a vector passing through a
        single point or a vector connecting two points.

        You can define rotational velocity and rotational axis for these
        analysis types:

        Static (ANTYPE,STATIC)

        Harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC) -- Full or modal superposition

        Transient (ANTYPE,TRANS)  -- Full or modal superposition

        Substructuring (ANTYPE,SUBSTR)

        Modal (ANTYPE,MODAL)

        Rotational velocities are combined with the element mass matrices to
        form a body force load vector term. Units are radians/time. Related
        commands are ACEL, CGLOC, CGLOC,  CGOMGA, CMDOMEGA, DCGOMG, DOMEGA.

        See Analysis Tools in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for more
        information.

        You can use the CMOMEGA command in conjunction with either one of the
        following two groups of commands, but not with both groups
        simultaneously:

        Components for which you want to specify rotational loading must
        consist of elements only. The elements you use cannot be part of more
        than one component, and elements that share nodes cannot exist in
        different element components. You cannot apply the loading to an
        assembly of element components.

        If you have applied the Coriolis effect (CORIOLIS) using a stationary
        reference frame, the CMOMEGA command takes the gyroscopic damping
        matrix into account for the elements listed under “Stationary Reference
        Frame” in the notes section of the CORIOLIS command. ANSYS verifies
        that the rotation vector axis is parallel to the axis of the element;
        if not, the gyroscopic effect is not applied. If you issue a CMOMEGA
        command when the Coriolis or gyroscopic effect is present, a
        subsequently issued OMEGA command has no effect.

        The CMOMEGA command supports tabular boundary conditions (%TABNAME_X%,
        %TABNAME_Y%, and %TABNAME_Z%) for CMOMEGA_X, CMOMEGA_Y, and CMOMEGA_Z
        input values (*DIM) for full transient and harmonic analyses.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply
        the load in the modal portion of the analysis. Mechanical APDL
        calculates a load vector and writes it to the MODE file, which you can
        apply via the LVSCALE command.

            Time at the end of the load step.

        Notes
        -----
        Associates the boundary conditions at the end of the load step with a
        particular TIME value.

        TIME must be a positive, nonzero, monotonically increasing quantity
        that "tracks" the input history.  Units of time should be consistent
        with those used elsewhere (for properties, creep equations, etc.).

        Typically, for the first load step TIME defaults to 1. However, for the
        first load step of a mode-superposition transient analysis
        (ANTYPE,TRANS and TRNOPT,MSUP), the TIME command is ignored and a
        static solution is performed at TIME = 0.

        For a full transient analyses, the command's default behavior does not
        apply. You must specify a time for each load step and it must be
        greater than the time at the end of the prior load step.

        TIME does not apply to modal (ANTYPE,MODAL), harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC),

                   side and the mapped Mechanical APDL target side during the
                   solution.

        Notes
        -----
        The FLUREAD command reads one-way Fluent-to-Mechanical APDL coupling
        data from a .cgns file. The Fluent one-side fast Fourier transformation
        (FFT) peak complex pressure values are mapped to the Mechanical APDL
        structure model during the acoustic-structural solution at each FFT
        frequency.

        The command can be used only for the model with the acoustic elements.

        To apply complex pressure to the structure model, define the SURF154
        surface element, then define the one-way coupling interface (SF,,FSIN)
        on the element.

        You can define the solving frequency range via the HARFRQ command. The
        solver selects the FFT frequencies between the beginning and ending
        frequencies. The number of substeps is determined by the number of FFT
        frequencies over the frequency range. The number of substeps defined
        via the NSUBST command is overwritten.

        For better mapping performance, consider the following:

        Calculations for out-of-bound points require much more processing time
        than do points that are within bounds.

        For each point in the structural destination mesh, the command searches
        all possible triangles in the Fluent source mesh to find the best
        triangle containing each point, then performs a linear interpolation
        inside this triangle. For faster and more accurate results, consider
        your interpolation method and search criteria carefully. (See LIMIT.)

        It is possible to apply one-way coupling excitation to multiple
        frequencies. The one-side FFT peak complex pressure values are
        necessary to do so.

        toler
            Tolerance for coincidence (based on maximum coordinate difference
            in each global Cartesian direction for node locations and on angle
            differences for node orientations).  Defaults to 0.0001.   Only

        Defines coupled degrees of freedom between coincident nodes (within a
        tolerance).  May be used, for example, to "button" together elements
        interfacing at a seam, where the seam consists of a series of node
        pairs.  One coupled set is generated for each selected degree of

        enum
            Element number having the normal direction that the reoriented
            elements are to match. If ENUM = P, graphical picking is enabled

        Notes

        Reorients shell elements so that their outward normals are consistent
        with that of a specified element. ENORM can also be used to reorder
        nodal connectivity of line elements so that their nodal ordering is
        consistent with that of a specified element.

        For shell elements, the operation reorients the element by reversing
        and shifting the node connectivity pattern. For example, for a 4-node
        shell element, the nodes in positions I, J, K and L of the original
        element are placed in positions J, I, L and K of the reoriented
        element. All 3-D shell elements in the selected set are considered for
        reorientation, and no element is reoriented more than once during the
        operation. Only shell elements adjacent to the lateral (side) faces are
        considered.

        The command reorients the shell element normals on the same panel as
        the specified shell element. A panel is the geometry defined by a
        subset of shell elements bounded by free edges or T-junctions (anywhere
        three or more shell edges share common nodes).

        Reorientation progresses within the selected set until either of the
        following conditions is true:

        The edge of the model is reached.

        More than two elements (whether selected or unselected) are adjacent to
        a lateral face.

        In situations where unselected elements might undesirably cause case b
        to control, consider using ENSYM,0,,0,ALL instead of ENORM.  It is
        recommended that reoriented elements be displayed and graphically
        reviewed.

        You cannot use the ENORM command to change the normal direction of any
        element that has a body or surface load. We recommend that you apply
        all of your loads only after ensuring that the element normal
        directions are acceptable.

        Parameters

        elem
             Non-structural elements to which mesh movement (morph) applies.
            If ALL, apply morphing to all selected elements [ESEL]. If ELEM =
            P, graphical picking is enabled.  A component may be substituted
            for ELEM.

        dimn
            Problem dimensionality.  Use "2" for a 2-D problem and "3" for a
            3-D problem (no default).

        rmshky
            Remesh flag option:

            0 - Remesh the selected non-structural regions only if mesh morphing fails.

            1 - Remesh the selected non-structural regions and bypass mesh morphing.

            2 - Perform mesh morphing only and do not remesh.

        Notes
        -----
        The selected elements should include only non-structural regions
        adjacent to structural regions. The exterior nodes of the selected
        elements will usually be on the boundary of the region which will have
        node positions displaced. For DIMN = 2, elements must lie on a flat
        plane. The DEMORPH command requires a single domain grouping of
        elements be provided (multiple domains of elements are not permitted).
        Exterior nodes will be assumed fixed (no nodes will be morphed) unless
        they coincide with structural nodes having nonzero displacements.

        Nodes in the structural regions move in accordance with computed
        displacements. Displacements from a structural analysis must be in the
        database prior to issuing DEMORPH.

        By default (RMSHKY = 0), DEMORPH will remesh the selected non-
        structural regions entirely if a satisfactory morphed mesh cannot be
        provided.

        If boundary conditions and loads are applied directly to nodes and
        elements, the DEMORPH command requires that these be removed before
        remeshing can take place.

        Exercise care with initial conditions defined by the IC command. Before
        a structural analysis is performed for a sequentially coupled analysis,
        the DEMORPH command requires that initial conditions be removed from
        all null element type nodes in the non-structural regions. Use ICDELE
        to delete the initial conditions.

        Pipes, Axisymmetric, Taper, Shells, Pretension, Joints, Reinforcing,
        and Contact.

        The data input on the SECDATA command is interpreted based on the most
        recently issued SECTYPE command. The data required is determined by the
        section type and subtype, and is different for each one.

        Beam sections are referenced by BEAM188 and BEAM189 elements. Not all
        SECOFFSET location values are valid for each subtype.

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: RECT

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: QUAD

        Degeneration to triangle is permitted by specifying the same
        coordinates for cells along an edge.

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: CSOLID

        Type: BEAM, Subtype: CTUBE

        Notes
        -----
        This command specifies output to be written during an explicit dynamics
        solution. The data corresponding to each Option is written to a
        separate ASCII file having the same name as the Option label. The data
        is written for the entire model at time intervals specified by the
        EDHTIME command. If no time interval is specified, output is written at
        1000 steps over the analysis. (See also the EDHIST command which
        specifies time-history output for a portion of the model.)  The data
        written to the MATSUM file is actually for each PART number (EDPART) at
        time intervals specified by the EDHTIME command, but the data is listed
        following the Mat no. in the file.

        For Option = NODOUT and ELOUT, you must specify a component; you must
        issue EDHIST before issuing EDOUT,NODOUT or EDOUT,ELOUT.

        Use EDOUT,LIST to list the current time-history output specifications.
        (The listing will include output requested with the EDHIST command.)
        Use EDOUT,DELE to delete all output specifications that have been
        defined with the EDOUT command.

        In order for the specified output files to be written, you must also
        request that explicit dynamics results be written to an LS-DYNA output
        file [EDWRITE,LSDYNA or EDWRITE,BOTH].

        In an explicit dynamic small restart analysis (EDSTART,2) or full
        restart analysis (EDSTART,3), the same ASCII files that were requested
        for the original analysis are written by default for the restart. You
        can request different files by issuing the appropriate EDOUT commands
        in the restart analysis.

        time
            Total Trace Time (seconds) (defaults to 0, which is the full flow
            trace).

        spacing
            Particle spacing in seconds (defaults to 0).

        offset
            Particle offset in seconds (defaults to 0).  It is used internally
            in the ANFLOW macro to produce an animation of particle flow in a
            flowing fluid or charged particle motion in an electric or magnetic
            field.

        size
            Particle size (defaults to 0, which is a line).

        Notes
        -----
        The TRTIME command varies the type of   PLTRAC display produced.
        Particle flow or charged particle traces follow a particle's path in
        the forward and backward direction of travel. The DOF selected
        determines the color of the particle trace.  SPACING defines the
        particle spacing in seconds from adjacent particles in the stream line.
        OFFSET defines the offset in seconds from the spacing set by the
        SPACING argument.

        LENGTH defines the particle length fraction.  The default value (.1),
        means the particle occupies 10% of the flow region, and the other 90%
        is a color-coded line.

        SIZE sets the radius of the particle. Use SPACING, OFFSET and LENGTH
        only when SIZE is nonzero (i.e., the particle is bigger than the line).

            ATTR - Sets carryover of particular pattern area attributes (materials, real
                   constants, and element coordinate systems) of the pattern
                   area elements to the generated volume elements. (See 2.)
                   Val1 can be:

            0 - Sets volume elements to use current MAT command settings.

            1 - Sets volume elements to use material attributes of the pattern area elements.

            Val2 can be:  - 0

            Sets volume elements to use current REAL command settings. - 1

            Sets volume elements to use real constant attributes of the pattern area elements. - Val3 can be:

            1 - Sets volume elements to use element coordinate system attributes of the pattern
                area elements.

            Val4 can be:  - 0

            Sets volume elements to use current SECNUM command settings. - 1

            Sets volume elements to use section attributes of the pattern area elements. - 

            ESIZE - Val1 sets the number of element divisions in the direction of volume generation
                    or volume sweep. For VDRAG and VSWEEP, Val1 is overridden
                    by the LESIZE command NDIV setting. Val2 sets the spacing
                    ratio (bias) in the direction of volume generation or
                    volume sweep. If positive, Val2 is the nominal ratio of

                    increase, if < 1.0, sizes decrease). If negative, Val2 is

            ACLEAR - Sets clearing of pattern area mesh. (See 3.) Val1 can be:

            0 - Sets pattern area to remain meshed when volume generation is done.

            1 - Sets pattern area mesh to clear when volume generation is done. Val2, Val3 ,
                and Val4 are ignored.

            VSWE - Indicates that volume sweeping options will be set using Val1 and Val2.
                   Settings specified with EXTOPT,VSWE will be used the next
                   time the VSWEEP command is invoked. If Lab = VSWE, Val1

                   or if VSWE should automatically determine the source and
                   target. If Val1 = AUTO, Val2 is ON by default. VSWE will
                   automatically determine the source and target for VSWEEP.
                   You will be allowed to pick more than one volume for
                   sweeping. When Val2 = OFF, the user will be prompted for the
                   source and target for VSWEEP. You will only be allowed to
                   pick one volume for sweeping.

            TETS - Indicates whether VSWEEP will tet mesh non-sweepable volumes or leave them
                   unmeshed. If Val1 = TETS, Val2 is OFF by default. Non-
                   sweepable volumes will be left unmeshed. When Val2 = ON, the
                   non-sweepable volumes will be tet meshed if the assigned
                   element type supports tet shaped elements.

        val1, val2, val3, val4
            Additional input values as described under each option for Lab.

        node
            Nodes at which the edge-flux (AZ) constraints corresponding to the
            uniform magnetic flux are to be specified.  Valid options are ALL
            (default) or Component Name. If ALL, constraints are applied to all

            Imaginary components of magnetic flux B.

        Notes
        -----
        The DFLX command sets the constraints on the edge-flux (AZ) degrees of
        freedom to produce a uniform magnetic flux B in an edge-based
        electromagnetic analysis using elements SOLID236 and SOLID237. The
        command ignores the corner nodes of the elements (even if they were
        selected) and imposes the AZ-constraints on the mid-side nodes only.
        The AZ-constraints are imposed in the active Cartesian coordinate
        system. A non-Cartesian coordinate system will be ignored by the DFLX
        command.

        The edge-flux constraints at the mid-side nodes are derived from  the
        magnetic vector potential A, which is related to the imposed magnetic
        flux B as follows:

        where r is the position of the mid-side node.

        The DFLX command creates a component named _DFLX for the constrained
        midside nodes. You can use this component to delete the constraints
        imposed by the DFLX command.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        APDL Command: EREINF

        Generates reinforcing elements from selected existing (base) elements.

        Notes
        -----
        The EREINF command generates reinforcing elements (REINF264 and
        REINF265) directly from selected base elements (that is, existing
        standard elements in your model). The command scans all selected base
        elements and generates (if necessary) a compatible reinforcing element
        type for each base element. (ANSYS allows a combination of different
        base element types.)

        Although predefining the reinforcing element type (ET) is not required,
        you must define the reinforcing element section type (SECTYPE);
        otherwise, ANSYS cannot generate the reinforcing element.

        The EREINF command does not create new nodes. The reinforcing elements
        and the base elements share the common nodes.

        Elements generated by this command are not associated with the solid
        model.

        After the EREINF command executes, you can issue ETLIST, ELIST, and
        EPLOT commands to verify the newly created reinforcing element types
        and elements.

        Reinforcing elements do not account for any subsequent modifications
        made to the base elements. ANSYS, Inc. recommends issuing the EREINF
        command only after the base elements are finalized. If you delete or
        modify base elements (via EDELE, EMODIF, ETCHG, EMID, EORIENT, NUMMRG,
        or NUMCMP commands, for example), remove all affected reinforcing
        elements and reissue the EREINF command to avoid inconsistencies.

            Generate elements from selected pattern beginning with IEL1 to IEL2
            (defaults to IEL1) in steps of IEINC (defaults to 1). If IEL1 is
            negative, IEL2 and IEINC are ignored and the last |IEL1| elements
            (in sequence backward from the maximum element number) are used as
            the pattern to be repeated.  If IEL1 = ALL, IEL2 and IEINC are

            repeated. If P1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining
            command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A component
            name may also be substituted for IEL1 (IEL2 and INC are ignored).

        minc
            Increment material number of all elements in the given pattern by
            MINC each time after the first.

        tinc
            Increment type number by TINC.

        cinc
            Increment element coordinate system number by CINC.

        sinc
            Increment section ID number by SINC.

        dx, dy, dz
            Define nodes that do not already exist but are needed by generated
            elements (as though the NGEN,ITIME,INC,NODE1,,,DX,DY,DZ were issued

            Controls the degree of tessellation used in the calculation of area

        Calculates and prints geometry statistics (area, centroid location,
        moments of inertia, volume, etc.) associated with the selected areas.
        ASUM should only be used on perfectly flat areas.

        Geometry items are reported in the global Cartesian coordinate system.
        A unit thickness is assumed unless the areas have a non-zero total
        thickness defined by real constant or section data.

        For layered areas, a unit density is always assumed. For single-layer
        areas, a unit density is assumed unless the areas have a valid material
        (density).

        The thickness and density are associated to the areas via the AATT
        command.

        Items calculated via ASUM and later retrieved via a *GET or *VGET
        command are valid only if the model is not modified after issuing the
        ASUM command.

        Setting a finer degree of tessellation will provide area calculations
        with greater accuracy, especially for thin, hollow models.  However,
        using a finer degree of tessellation requires longer processing.

        For very narrow (sliver) areas, such that the ratio of the minimum to
        the maximum dimension is less than 0.01, the ASUM command can provide
        erroneous area information.  To ensure that the calculations are

        Generates nodes from a given node pattern by a symmetry reflection.
        Reflection is done in the active coordinate system by changing a
        particular coordinate sign.  Nodes in the pattern may have been
        generated in any coordinate system.   Nodal rotation angles are not
        reflected.

        Symmetry reflection may be used with any node pattern, in any
        coordinate system, as many times as desired.  Reflection is
        accomplished by a coordinate sign change (in the active coordinate
        system).  For example, an X-reflection in a Cartesian coordinate system
        generates additional nodes from a given pattern, with a node increment
        added to each node number, and an X coordinate sign change.  An
        R-reflection in a cylindrical coordinate system gives a reflected
        "radial" location by changing the "equivalent" Cartesian (i.e., the
        Cartesian system with the same origin as the active cylindrical system)
        X and Y coordinate signs.  An R-reflection in a spherical coordinate
        system gives a reflected "radial" location by changing the equivalent
        Cartesian X, Y, and Z coordinate location signs.  Nodal coordinate
        system rotation angles are not reflected.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you

            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        Notes
        -----
        The field to be imported should be written to a CDB file (CDWRITE
        command). This file is read into the database, offsetting all existing
        element type numbers, node numbers, etc. in order to accommodate the
        imported field. (See the NUMOFF command for information on offset
        capabilities.) It then updates all of the previously issued MFxx
        commands to the new element type numbers. A new field is created using
        the specified field number, which must not currently exist. If there
        are no ANSYS Multi-field solver command files written for the existing
        fields in the database, one will be written for each field with the
        default name (see the MFCMMAND command). A MFCMMAND will be issued for
        the imported field as well.

            ESEL - Unselects the valid elements.

        Notes
        -----
         Wherever two area or volume elements share a common face, MCHECK
        verifies that the way the elements are connected to the face is
        consistent with their relative normals or integrated volumes. (This may
        detect folds or otherwise overlapping elements.)

         MCHECK verifies that the element exterior faces form simply-connected
        closed surfaces. (This may detect unintended cracks in a mesh.)

         MCHECK warns if the number of element facets in a 2-D loop or 3-D
        shell is not greater than a computed limit. This limit is the smaller
        of either three times the number of faces on one element, or one-tenth
        the total number of element faces in the model. (This may detect holes
        in the middle of a mesh.)

        The MCHECK command will perform a number of validity checks on the
        selected elements, including:

        Normal check:  Wherever two area elements share a common edge, MCHECK
        verifies that the ordering of the nodes on each element is consistent
        with their relative normals.

        Volume check:  Wherever two volume elements share a common face, MCHECK
        verifies that the sign of the integrated volume of each element is
        consistent.

        Closed surface check:  MCHECK verifies that the element exterior faces
        form simply-connected closed surfaces (this may detect unintended
        cracks in a mesh).

        Check for holes in the mesh:  MCHECK warns if the number of element
        faces surrounding an interior void in the mesh is small enough to
        suggest one or more accidentally omitted elements, rather than a
        deliberately formed hole. For this test, the number of faces around the
        void is compared to the smaller of a) three times the number of faces

            FTOL - Employ a specified tolerance (FDBVAL) to determine rigid body modes in the
                   calculation.

            FAUTO - Automatically determine rigid body modes in the calculation. This method is the

            rigid body modes if FBDDEF = FNUM (where the value is an integer
            from 0 through 6), or the tolerance to employ if FBDDEF = FTOL

        Notes
        -----
        CMS employs the Block Lanczos eigensolution method in the generation
        pass.

        CMS supports damping matrix reduction when a damping matrix exists. Set
        the matrix generation key to 3 (SEOPT,Sename,SEMATR) to generate and
        then reduce stiffness, mass, and damping matrices.

        CMS does not support the SEOPT,,,,,RESOLVE command. Instead, ANSYS sets
        the expansion method for the expansion pass (EXPMTH) to BACKSUB.

        For more information about performing a CMS analysis, see Component
        Mode Synthesis in the Substructuring Analysis Guide.

        If IOKEY = TCMS is used to output the transformation matrix, then only
        ITEM = NSOL is valid in the OUTPR command.  In the interactive
        sessions, the transformation matrix will not be output if the model has

        entity
            Label identifying the type of geometry items to be grouped:

            NODE - Nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        Components may be further grouped into assemblies [CMGRP].  The
        selected items of the specified entity type will be stored as the
        component.  Use of this component in the select command [CMSEL] causes
        all these items to be selected at once, for convenience.

        A component is a grouping of some geometric entity that can then be
        conveniently selected or unselected.  A component may be redefined by
        reusing a previous component name.  The following entity types may
        belong to a component: nodes, elements, keypoints, lines, areas, and
        volumes.  A component may contain only 1 entity type, but an individual
        item of any entity may belong to any number of components.  Once
        defined, the items contained in a component may then be easily selected
        or unselected [CMSEL].  Components may be listed [CMLIST], modified
        [CMMOD] and deleted [CMDELE].  Components may also be further grouped
        into assemblies [CMGRP].  Other entities associated with the entities
        in a component (e.g., the lines and keypoints associated with areas)
        may be selected by the ALLSEL command.

        An item will be deleted from a component if it has been deleted by
        another operation (see the KMODIF command for an example).  Components
        are automatically updated to reflect deletions of one or more of their
        items.  Components are automatically deleted and a warning message is
        issued if all their items are deleted.  Assemblies are also
        automatically updated to reflect deletions of one or more of their
        components or subassemblies, but are not deleted if all their

        label
            Show symbols as selected from the following labels:

            CS - Local coordinate systems.

            NDIR - Nodal coordinate systems (on rotated nodes only).

            ESYS - Element coordinate systems (element displays only).

            LDIR - Line directions (line displays only).

            LDIV - Controls the display of element divisions on lines.

            ADIR - Area direction symbol (for keypoint, line, area and volume plots).

            LAYR - Layer orientations (relative to the projected element x-axis) or fiber
                   orientations in smeared reinforcing elements. Used only
                   within an element display. Use KEY to specify the layer
                   number.

            ECON - Element mesh symbols on keypoints and lines.

            DOT - Larger symbols displayed for node and keypoint locations.  When Label = DOT,
                  KEY = 1 by default.

            XNOD - Extra node of surface or circuit elements.

            FBCS - Force boundary condition scaling. Subsequent KEY value determines whether or
                   not to scale the applied and derived forces/moments to the
                   same maximum value.

            DEFA - Resets the symbol keys so that ANSYS displays none of the symbols controlled by
                   the /PSYMB command.  The value of the KEY field is ignored.

            STAT - Prints the status of the settings of the symbol keys controlled by the /PSYMB
                   command.  The KEY field is ignored.

        key
            Symbol key:

            -1  - Effective only if Label = LAYR and solid shape element display (/ESHAPE) is
                  active. Orientation of all layers appears with the solid
                  shape element display.

            0  - No symbol (default). If Label = LDIV, then KEY= 0 indicates that the displayed
                 element divisions will correspond to the existing mesh (the
                 word MESHED or EXISTING can also be substituted). Also, for
                 Label = LDIV, if you execute any meshing command (such as
                 AMESH or VMESH), KEY is set to 0 (MESHED) automatically. If
                 Label = FBCS, then KEY= 0 indicates that boundary condition
                 scaling will not be common. The applied and derived
                 forces/moments will be scaled to their respective maximum
                 values.

            1  - Include symbol. If Label = LDIV, then KEY = 1 indicates that the displayed line
                 divisions will correspond to the value assigned by LESIZE (the
                 word LESIZE can also be substituted). Also, for Label = LDIV,
                 if you execute the LESIZE command, KEY is set to 1 (LESIZE)
                 automatically. If Label = FBCS, then KEY= 1 indicates that
                 boundary condition scaling will be common. The applied and
                 derived forces/moments will be scaled to the same maximum
                 value.

            N  - If Label = LAYR, then N is equal to the layer number. If Label = DOT, then N
                 can be equal to 0,1,.....15, indicating the dot size. If Label
                 = LDIV, then KEY = -1, indicates that no element divisions
                 will be displayed (the word OFF can also be substituted).

        Notes
        -----
        Includes various symbols on the display.  Triads are right-handed with
        x displayed as the longest leg.  Where color is displayed, x is white,
        y is green, and z is blue.  For beams, x is always along the length of
        the element.   For lines, an arrow represents the direction of a line,
        from the beginning keypoint to the end keypoint.  See /PLOPTS command
        for additional display options.  Use /PSTATUS or /PSYMB,STAT to display
        settings.  Use /PSYMB,DEFA to reset all specifications back to their
        defaults.  The command /PSYMB,ECON,1 causes the symbol "M" to be
        displayed on keypoints and lines associated with meshed entities.  When
        you issue the command /PSYMB,DOT,1, a larger symbol is displayed for
        each node and keypoint location.

        PowerGraphics (/GRAPHICS,POWER) does not support /PSYMB,ESYS and
        /PSYMB,LAYR.

        If KEY = N and PowerGraphics is off, the centroid of the surface
        elements is connected to the extra node using a gray line.  However, if
        PowerGraphics is on, the color of the line connecting the centroid to
        the extra node is the same as that for the elements themselves (as
        determined by /PNUM).

        When Label = LAYR, the layer systems can be visualized with all
        current-technology layered elements and the smeared reinforcing element
        REINF265. To use /PSYMB,LAYR with REINF265, first set the vector-mode

            Defaults to 0.001.

        cnvflux
            Tolerance value on the program-calculated reference value for the
            magnetic flux convergence.  Used for all scalar potential solution
            options (OPT = 2, 3, 4).  Defaults to 0.001.

        neqit
            Maximum number of equilibrium iterations per load step.  Defaults
            to 25.

        biot
            Option to force execution of a Biot-Savart integral solution
            [BIOT,NEW] for the scalar potential options.  Required if multiple
            load steps are being performed with different current source
            primitives (SOURC36 elements).

            0 - Do not force execution of Biot-Savart calculation (default); Biot-Savart is
                automatically calculated only for the first solution.

            1 - Force execution of Biot-Savart calculation.

        cnvtol
            Sets the convergence tolerance for AMPS reaction. Defaults to 1e-3.

        Notes
        -----
        MAGSOLV invokes an ANSYS macro which specifies magnetic solution
        options and initiates the solution.  The macro is applicable to any
        ANSYS magnetostatic analysis using the magnetic vector potential (MVP),
        reduced scalar potential (RSP), difference scalar potential (DSP),
        general scalar potential (GSP), or combined MVP-RSP formulation
        options.  Results are only stored for the final converged solution.
        (In POST1, issue *SET,LIST to identify the load step of solution
        results.)  The macro internally determines if a nonlinear analysis is
        required based on magnetic material properties.

        If you use the BIOT option and issue SAVE after solution or
        postprocessing, the Biot-Savart calculations are saved to the database,
        but will be overwritten upon normal exit from the program.  To save
        this data after issuing SAVE, use the /EXIT,NOSAVE command.  You can
        also issue the /EXIT,SOLU command to exit ANSYS and save all solution
        data, including the Biot-Savart calculations, in the database.
        Otherwise, when you issue RESUME, the Biot-Savart calculation will be
        lost (resulting in a zero solution).

        The MVP, MVP-RSP, and edge formulation options perform a two-load-step
        solution sequence.  The first load step ramps the applied loads over a
        prescribed number of substeps (NRAMP), and the second load step
        calculates the converged solution.  For linear problems, only a single
        load step solution is performed.  The ramped load step can be bypassed
        by setting NRAMP to -1.

        The RSP option solves in a single load step using the adaptive descent
        procedure.  The DSP option uses two load steps, and the GSP solution
        uses three load steps.

        The following analysis options and nonlinear options are controlled by
        this macro:  KBC, NEQIT, NSUBST, CNVTOL, NROPT, MAGOPT, and OUTRES.

        You cannot use constraint equations with OPT = 4.

        read
            File read option:

            START - Reread start162.ans file (default).

        Notes

        Resets the ANSYS database to the conditions at the beginning of the
        problem.  Sets the import and Boolean options back to the ANSYS
        default. All items are deleted from the database and memory values are
        set to zero for items derived from database information.  All files are
        left intact.  This command is useful between multiple analyses in the
        same run, or between passes of a multipass analysis (such as between
        the substructure generation, use, and expansion passes).  Should not be
        used in a do-loop since loop counters will be reset.  The start162.ans
        file will be reread (by default) after the database is cleared, unless
        Read is set to NOSTART.  Additional commands cannot be stacked (using
        the $ separator) on the same line as the /CLEAR command.

        Use care when placing the /CLEAR command within branching constructs
        (for example, those employing *DO or *IF commands).  The command
        deletes all parameters including the looping parameter for do-loops.
        (You can preserve your iteration parameter by issuing a PARSAV command
        prior to the /CLEAR command, then following the /CLEAR command with a
        PARRES command.)

        /CLEAR resets the jobname to match the currently open session .LOG and
        .ERR files. This will return the jobname to its original value, or to
        the most recent value specified on /FILNAME with KEY = 1.

        ----------
        fname
            ASAS file name. Defaults to Jobname.

        key
            Key indicating type of file to produce:

            0 - ASAS file for use by ANSYS Aqwa (no loads written). Creates the file
                Fname.asas.

            1 - ASAS file (all data written, including loads). Creates the file Fname.asas.

            2 - ASAS(NL) file. Creates the file Fname.asnl.

        Notes
        -----
        This command creates an input file for the ANSYS Asas Finite Element
        Analysis System from the model and loads currently in the database,
        based on the currently selected set of elements. Most common structural
        element types are written, as well as sections (or real constants),
        materials, boundary conditions and loads, and solution and load step
        options.

        Data Written

        The following data is written:

        Solution control options

        Nodes

        Elements

        Material data

        Geometry data

        Section data

        ANSYS element components (ASAS sets)

        Boundary conditions

        Loads

        Added mass (via MASS21 element)

        Details are provided in the following sections.

        Not all data is written. You must verify the completeness and accuracy
        of the data. Only loading at the current step is transferred; hence, no
        load step history is captured.

        Solution Control Options

        The ASAS project name is defined as "ANSYS".

        The solution control options are converted as follows:

        JOB: STAT SPIT: KGEOM

        JOB: STAT SPIT: KGEOM

        For conversion to ASAS(NL), the large displacement option is set based
        on NLGEOM, final load solution time is set based on TIME, and sub-step
        times are set based on DELTIM or NSUBST (assuming constant step size).

        Element Data

        If you intend to use the data only with AQWA-WAVE, only the elements
        that form the wetted surface are required.  Selecting these elements
        before invoking the ANSTOASAS command will improve performance.  In
        order for AQWA-WAVE to identify the direction of the wave loading, all
        elements must be defined by nodes in a clockwise direction. For further
        information, refer to the AQWA-WAVE manual.

        The element types are converted as follows:

        nodes: are: not: coincident:  and: longitudinal: spring:

        Documentation for this legacy element type appears in the Feature
        Archive.

        Material Data

        Linear isotropic material conversion is supported for ASAS and
        ASAS(NL).

        Geometry Data

        The following ASAS element geometry data is supported:

        ----------
        part
            Part number for which the inertia is defined (the part number must
            have been previously generated using the EDPART command).  The part
            should be composed of a rigid material (EDMP,RIGID). For Option =
            ADD, you must input a value; there is no default. For Option = DELE
            or LIST, PART defaults to all parts.

        option


            ADD - Define inertia for the specified PART (default).

            DELE - Delete the inertia properties for the specified PART. The remaining fields are
                   ignored. If PART is blank, inertia properties previously
                   specified using EDIPART are deleted for all rigid parts.

                   ignored. If PART is blank, inertia properties are listed for
                   all rigid parts.

        cvect
            The vector containing the global Cartesian coordinates of the
            center of mass for the part. This vector must have been previously
            defined with a dimension of three (*DIM command) and filled in as
            shown below. If Cvect is blank, the global Cartesian origin (0,0,0)
            is used as the center of mass.

        tm
            Translation mass (no default, must be defined).

        ircs
            Flag for inertia tensor reference coordinate system.

            0 (or blank) - Global inertia tensor (default). You must supply all six inertia tensor
                           components (see Ivect).

            1 - Principal moments of inertia with orientation vectors. You must supply IXX,
                IYY, IZZ (see Ivect) and CID.

        ivect
            The name of a vector containing the components of the inertia
            tensor. This vector must have been previously defined (*DIM
            command) with a dimension of six and filled in as shown below.
            Vector entries 2, 3, and 5 are ignored if IRCS = 1. There is no
            default for this vector; it must be specified.

        vvect
            The name of a vector containing the initial velocity (relative to
            the global Cartesian coordinate system) of the rigid part. This
            vector must have been previously defined (*DIM command) with a
            dimension of six and filled in as shown below. If Vvect is blank,
            the initial velocity defaults to zero.

        cid
            Local coordinate system ID. This coordinate system must have been
            previously defined with the EDLCS command. You must input CID if
            IRCS = 1 (no default).

        Notes
        -----
        The EDIPART command applies only to rigid parts (EDMP,RIGID). It allows

        Notes
        -----
        Nonreflecting boundaries can be defined on the external surfaces of
        SOLID164 and SOLID168 elements that are being used to model an infinite
        domain. They are typically used in geomechanical applications to limit
        the size of the model. For example, when a half space is being modeled
        with a finite geometry, the nonreflecting boundary option can be used
        to prevent artificial stress wave reflections generated at the boundary
        from reentering the model and contaminating the results.

        When using nonreflecting boundaries, you should not constrain the nodes
        at the boundary; doing so would negate the presence of the dampers.
        Usually, the large mass of the finite domain is sufficient to resist
        motion.

            Value (or file name extension) as noted with label above.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a command generated by the GUI and will appear in the log file

        This command is used to define a group of simultaneously-processed

        field solvers ansys-code and cfx-code, enter MFPS,g1,ansys-code,cfx-
        code.

        To indicate groups of sequentially-processed field solvers for your MFX
        analysis, create two groups (g1 and g2).

        A field solver refers to a specific instance of an ANSYS or CFX solver
        execution that is defined by the respective input file(s) referenced
        when starting the solver (through the launcher or from the command
        line). The field solver names that are referenced in several MFX
        commands must be consistent with the names that will be used when
        starting the coupled simulation.

        Note:: : When running MFX from the launcher, you must use ANSYS and CFX
        (uppercase) as the field solver names (MFPSIMUL) in your input file.

            (concentration).

        value
            Degree of freedom value or table name reference for tabular
            boundary conditions.  To specify a table, enclose the table name in
            percent signs (%) (e.g., DK,NODE,TEMP,%tabname%).  Use the *DIM
            command to define a table.

        value2
            Second degree of freedom value (if any).  If the analysis type and
            the degree of freedom allow a complex input, VALUE (above) is the
            real component and VALUE2 is the imaginary component.

        kexpnd
            Expansion key:

            0 - Constraint applies only to the node at this keypoint.

            1 - Flags this keypoint for constraint expansion.

        lab2, lab3, lab4, . . . ,  lab6
            Additional degree of freedom labels.  The same values are applied
            to the keypoints for these labels.

        Notes
        -----
        A keypoint may be flagged using KEXPND to allow its constraints to be
        expanded to nodes on the attached solid model entities having similarly
        flagged keypoint constraints.  Constraints are transferred from
        keypoints to nodes with the DTRAN or SBCTRAN commands.  The expansion
        uses interpolation to apply constraints to the nodes on the lines
        between flagged keypoints.  If all keypoints of an area or volume
        region are flagged and the constraints (label and values) are equal,
        the constraints are applied to the interior nodes of the region.  See
        the D command for a description of nodal constraints.

        Tabular boundary conditions (VALUE = %tabname%) are available only for
        the following degree of freedom labels: Electric (VOLT), structural
        (UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ), Acoustic (PRES, UX, UY, UZ), and
        temperature (TEMP, TBOT, TE2, TE3, . . ., TTOP).

        Constraints specified by the DK command can conflict with other
        specified constraints.  See Resolution of Conflicting Constraint
        Specifications in the Basic Analysis Guide for details.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Label identifying the option to be performed:

            ADD - Define an equation to constrain two rigid bodies (default).

            DELE - Delete the equation (specified by NEQN) that constrains two rigid bodies. If
                   NEQN is blank, all equations constraining rigid bodies are
                   deleted.

            LIST - List constrained rigid bodies specified by NEQN. If NEQN is blank, all
                   constrained rigid bodies are listed.

        neqn
            Equation reference number. Defaults to PARTS.  NEQN should be a
            unique number for each pair of PARTM and PARTS. If it is not
            unique, the equation reference number defined last will overwrite
            any previously defined NEQN with the same number.

        partm
            PART number [EDPART] identifying the master rigid body. This value
            is ignored if the DELE or LIST labels are specified. No default;
            you must enter a value.

        parts
            PART number [EDPART] identifying the slave rigid body. This value
            is ignored if the DELE or LIST labels are specified. No default;
            you must enter a value.

        Notes
        -----
        EDCRB is valid only for materials defined as rigid bodies with the
        EDMP,RIGID command. EDCRB automatically generates a constraint equation
        to force the specified rigid bodies to behave as a single rigid body.
        The slave rigid body takes on the material properties and loading of
        the master rigid body. Any loads [EDLOAD] existing on the slave rigid
        body are ignored.

        To create a single large rigid body from several smaller bodies, use a
        series of EDCRB commands. With the first command, specify a master and
        slave to create the first combined rigid body. Then, using that body as
        the master, specify another slave to create a larger rigid body.
        Continue the process, using the expanding rigid body as the master and
        adding slave bodies until you have defined the desired large rigid
        body. All slave rigid bodies will take on the material properties and
        loading of the original master rigid body. Note that you will need to
        use different NEQN values for each pair of PARTM and PARTS.  This
        command will be ignored if you specify the previously-defined master
        rigid body as a slave rigid body in the same analysis. To change the
        master and slave definitions, first use the DELE option to delete all
        master and slave definitions, and then use the ADD option to redefine
        them.

        The equation number, NEQN, is a reference number by which the
        constrained bodies can be identified for listing and deleting purposes
        on the EDCRB command. For any other reference to the constrained bodies
        (loading, contact definitions, etc.), use the master body part number
        (PARTM).

        This command is also valid in SOLUTION.

        APDL Command: CNKMOD

        Modifies contact element key options.

        Parameters
        ----------
        itype
            Contact element type number as defined on the ET command.

        knum
            Number of the KEYOPT to be modified (KEYOPT(KNUM)).

        value
            Value to be assigned to the KEYOPT.

        Notes
        -----
        The CNKMOD command has the same syntax as the KEYOPT command. However,
        it is valid only in the SOLUTION processor. This command is intended
        only for use in a linear perturbation analysis, and can only be used to
        modify certain contact element KEYOPT values as described below.

        Modifying KEYOPT(12)

        One use for this command is to modify contact interface behavior
        between load steps in a linear perturbation analysis; it allows the
        user to control the contact status locally per contact pair. For this
        application, this command is limited to changing the contact interface
        behavior key option: KEYOPT(12) of CONTA171, CONTA172, CONTA173,
        CONTA174, CONTA175, CONTA176, and CONTA177; and KEYOPT(10) of CONTA178.

        When used for this purpose, the command adjusts the contact status from
        the linear perturbation base analysis (at the point of restart) as
        described in the table below. Note that CNKMOD allows you to take
        points in the base analysis that are near contact (within the pinball
        region) and modify them to be treated as "in contact" in the
        perturbation analysis; see the "1 - near-field" row with KEYOPT(12)
        values set to 4 or 5. CNKMOD also allows you to take points that are
        sliding in the base analysis and treat them as sticking in the
        perturbation analysis, irrespective of the MU value; see the "2 -
        sliding" row with KEYOPT(12) values set to 1,3, 5, or 6.

        Table: 128:: : Adjusted Contact Status with CNKMOD is Issued

        (if outside of the adjusted pinball region)

        (if inside of the adjusted pinball region)

        (if outside of the adjusted pinball region)

        (if inside of the adjusted pinball region)

        If an open gap exists at the end of the previous load step and the
        contact status is adjusted as sliding or sticking due to a “bonded” or
        “no seperation” contact behavior definition, then the program will
        treat it as near-field contact when executing CNKMOD in the subsequent
        load steps.

        In the linear perturbation analysis procedure, contact status can also
        be controlled or modified by the PERTURB command. The contact status
        always follows local controls defined by the CNKMOD command first, and
        is then adjusted by the global sticking or bonded setting (ContKey =
        STICKING or BONDED) on the PERTURB command (see the PERTURB command for
        details).

        Modifying KEYOPT(3)

        Another use for this command is to change the units of normal contact
        stiffness (contact element real constant FKN) in a linear perturbation
        modal analysis that is used to model brake squeal. For contact elements
        CONTA171, CONTA172, CONTA173, and CONTA174, KEYOPT(3) controls the
        units of normal contact stiffness. You can issue the command
        CNKMOD,ITYPE,3,1 during the first phase of the linear perturbation
        analysis in order to change the units of normal contact stiffness from
        FORCE/LENGTH3 (in the base analysis) to FORCE/LENGTH. Note that
        KEYOPT(3) = 1 is valid only when a penalty-based algorithm is used
        (KEYOPT(2) = 0 or 1) and the absolute normal contact stiffness value is
        explicitly specified (that is, a negative value input for real constant
        FKN).

                   step options, constraint equations, coupled nodes, results,
                   and GUI preference settings) then reads all the information

            LIST - Lists currently defined physics files and their titles.

            DELETE - Deletes a specified physics file and its title from the database.

            CLEAR - Deletes all material properties, solution options, load step options,

                    active physics file title from the database.

            STATUS - Displays information about all active elements and settings.

        title
            A user-defined title that quickly identifies a set of physics
            settings.  For example, you might use "Fluid," "Structural," or
            "Magnetic" as titles.  A title can contain up to 64 characters. It
            can be entered in lower or upper case. Lower case is internally
            converted to upper case within the program.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        Use the PHYSICS command when you are performing a multiphysics analysis
        that involves two different disciplines (for example, magnetic and
        structural analyses) and you cannot solve both analyses simultaneously.
        Once you have set up physics environments for both analyses, you can
        use the PHYSICS,READ command to change between the defined physics
        environments.  For more information about doing multiphysics analyses,
        see Sequential Coupled-Field Analysis in the Coupled-Field Analysis
        Guide.

        The PHYSICS command outputs all solution information, including
        analysis options, to the Jobname.PHn file described above.  Although it
        also outputs components, the ANSYS program does not list entities
        (nodes, elements, lines, etc.).

        PHYSICS,WRITE will overwrite existing physics files with the same title
        (even if the name is different). In other words, if the directory has a
        physics file with the same title as the active physics file title, but
        a different name, the PHYSICS,WRITE command will overwrite the existing
        physics file and use the existing filename, not the filename specified
        on the PHYSICS,WRITE command.

        isym
            Name of the array parameter vector containing the symmetry key for

        Calculates the coefficients of a Fourier series for a given curve, or
        evaluates the Fourier curve from the given (or previously calculated)
        coefficients.  The lengths of the COEFF, MODE, and ISYM vectors must be
        the same--typically two times the number of modes desired, since two
        terms (sine and cosine) are generally required for each mode.  The
        lengths of the CURVE and THETA vectors should be the same or the
        smaller of the two will be used.  There should be a sufficient number
        of points to adequately define the curve--at least two times the number
        of coefficients.  A starting array element number (1) must be defined
        for each array parameter vector.  The vector specifications *VLEN,

            OFF - Pivot values are not checked. This key causes the analysis to continue in spite

        prntcntrl
            Provides print options. Print output with these options will be
            sent to the default output file, not to the files created by the
            nonlinear diagnostic tools (NLDIAG).

            ONCE - Print only the maximum and minimum pivot information on the first call to the
                   sparse solver (which is the default solver). This is the
                   default behavior.

            EVERY - Print the maximum and minimum pivot information at every call to the sparse
                    solver. This option is provided for nonlinear analysis
                    diagnostics.

        Notes
        -----
        This command is valid for all analyses. In a nonlinear analysis, a
        negative pivot may be valid. In some cases, rigid body motions in a
        nonlinear analysis will be trapped by error routines checking
        infinitely large displacements (DOF limit exceeded) or nonconvergence
        status. An under-constrained model may avoid the pivot check, but fail
        with a DOF limit exceeded error.

        Machine precision may affect whether a small pivot triggers an error or
        bypasses this checking logic. You may wish to review the ratio of the
        maximum to absolute minimum pivot values. For ratios exceeding 12 to 14
        orders of magnitude, the accuracy of the computed solution may be
        degraded by the severe ill-conditioning of the assembled matrix.

        Note that negative pivots corresponding to Lagrange multiplier based
        mixed u-P elements are not checked or reported by this command.
        Negative pivots arising from the u-P element formulation and related
        analyses can occur and lead to correct solutions.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Activates a predictor in a nonlinear analysis on the degree-of-freedom
        solution for the first equilibrium iteration of each substep.

        When using the arc-length method (ARCLEN, ARCTRM), you cannot issue the
        DOF solution predictor command (PRED), the automatic time stepping
        command (AUTOTS), or the line search command (LNSRCH). If you activate
        the arc-length method after you set PRED, AUTOTS, or LNSRCH, a warning
        message appears. If you elect to proceed with the arc-length method,
        the program disables your DOF predictor, automatic time stepping, and
        line search settings, and the time step size is controlled by the arc-
        length method internally.

        When using step-applied loads, such as TUNIF, BFUNIF, etc., or other
        types of non-monotonic loads, the predictor may adversely affect the
        convergence. If the solution is discontinuous, the predictor may need
        to be turned off.

        When performing a nonlinear analysis involving large rotations, the

            EO - Excitation engine order.

            Value1 - The value of the excitation order, which must be an integer. The loadings on
                     the other sectors will be related to the loading on the
                     basic sector based on the engine order phase shift.

                            complex frequencies. The harmonic solution is not
                            performed.

        Notes
        -----
        The program solves a cyclically symmetric model (set up via the CYCLIC
        command during preprocessing) at the harmonic indices specified via the
        CYCOPT command.

        The aerodynamic coefficients are specified in a 5×(N×r) array (*DIM),
        where N is the number of blades and r can be any positive integer. Each
        column has the structure:

        where:

        One aerodynamic damping coefficient must be specified for each IBPA
        (equal to the number of blades) while keeping m and n constant.

        For constant (frequency-independent) mistuning, the stiffness
        parameters are specified in an N×1 array (*DIM) where N is the number
        of blades.

        For stiffness mistuning, each row entry represents the deviation of
        Young’s modulus from nominal,  (or equivalently, the ratio of the
        frequency deviation squared). Each frequency can also be independently
        mistuned, in which case the array is N×M, where M is the number of
        blade frequencies (Value3 of CYCFREQ,BLADE). The entries in each row
        therefore correspond to the ratio of the mistuned frequency to the
        tuned frequency squared minus one:

        The USER option activates the solution macro CYCMSUPUSERSOLVE.MAC. The
        normal solution is skipped. You may implement your own mistuning
        solution using APDL and APDL Math operations, or call your own program
        for the solution.

        The CYCFREQ command is valid in the preprocessing and solution stages
        of an analysis.

        The CYCFREQ,MODAL,ON command writes modal frequencies to the output
        file. No other postprocessing is available for this modal solve.

        When using CYCFREQ,RESTART, only mistuning parameters or frequency
        range may be changed. All other changes in parameters are ignored.

        Notes
        -----
        The NAXIS command generates or clears the nodes for general
        axisymmetric element sections. The command applies to elements SURF159,
        SOLID272, and SOLID273.

        The generate option (Action = GEN) operates automatically on any
        current-technology axisymmetric element. Any nodes within the tolerance
        value (TOLER) of the axis are merged into a single node. The default
        tolerance is 1.0e-4.

        If you want to change the number of nodes, use the clear option (Action

        use NAXIS,EFACET,NUM, where NUM > 1. In this case, the coordinate
        system specified for displaying element and nodal results (RSYS) must

        Parameters
        ----------
        nsector
            The number of sectors in the full 360 degrees, or one of the
            following options:

            STATUS - Indicates the current cyclic status.

            OFF - Resets model to normal (non-cyclic) status and removes the duplicate sector if
                  it exists. This option also deletes automatically detected
                  edge components (generated when USRCOMP = 0).

            UNDOUBLE - Removes the duplicate sector if it exists. The duplicate sector is created
                       during the solution (SOLVE) stage of a modal cyclic
                       symmetry analysis.

        angle
            The sector angle in degrees.

        kcn
            An arbitrary reference number assigned to the cyclic coordinate
            system.  The default value of 0 specifies automatic detection.

        name
            The root name of sector low- and high-edge components (line, area,
            or node components). The default root name (when USRCOMP = 0) is
            "CYCLIC". A root name that you specify can contain up to 11
            characters.

        usrcomp
            The number of pairs of user-defined low- and high-edge components
            on the cyclic sector (if any). The default value of 0 specifies
            automatic detection of sector edges; however, the automatic setting
            is not valid in all cases. (For more information, see the Notes
            section below.) If the value is greater than 0, no verification of
            user-defined components occurs.

        usrnmap
            The name of a user-defined array specifying the matching node pairs
            between the sector low and high edges. Valid only when USRCOMP = 0.
            Skips the automatic detection of sector edges. Node pairs may be
            input in any order, but the low edge node must be the first entry
            in each pair.

        Notes
        -----
        You can input your own value for NSECTOR, ANGLE or KCN; if you do so,
        the command verifies argument values before executing.

        When USRCOMP = 0 and USRNMAP = blank (default), the CYCLIC command
        automatically detects low- and high-edge components for models
        comprised of any combination of line, area, or volume elements. If a
        solid model exists, however, the  command uses only the lines, areas,
        and/or volumes to determine the  low- and high-edge components; the
        elements, if any, are ignored.

        Nodes will be automatically rotated unless CYCOPT,USERROT,YES has been
        specified.

        If you issue a CYCOPT,TOLER command to set a tolerance for edge-
        component pairing before issuing the CYCLIC command, the CYCLIC command
        uses the specified tolerance when performing automatic edge-component
        detection.

        For 2-D models, autodetection does not consider the CSYS,5 or CSYS,6
        coordinate system specification.  Autodetection for 180 degree (two-
        sector) models is not possible unless a central hole exists.

        The CYCLIC command sets values and keys so that, if possible, the area-
        mesh (AMESH) or volume-mesh (VMESH) command meshes the sector with
        matching node and element face patterns on the low and high edges. (The
        command has no effect on any other element-creation command.)

        Issue the CYCLIC command prior to the meshing command to, if possible,
        produce a mesh with identical node and element patterns on the low and
        high sector edges. Only the AMESH or VMESH commands can perform
        automated matching. (Other meshing operation commands such as VSWEEP
        cannot.) If you employ a meshing operation other than AMESH or VMESH,
        you should ensure that node and element face patterns match, if
        desired. The CYCLIC command output indicates whether each edge-
        component pair has or can produce a matching node pair.

        A cyclic solution (via the SOLVE command) allows dissimilar mesh
        patterns on the extreme boundaries of a cyclically symmetric model. The
        allowance for dissimilar patterns is useful when you have only finite-
        element meshes for your model but not the geometry data necessary to
        remesh it to obtain identical node patterns. In such cases, it is
        possible to obtain solution results, although perhaps at the expense of
        accuracy. A warning message appears because results may be degraded
        near the sector edges.

        The constraint equations (CEs) that tie together the low and high edges
        of your model are generated at the solution stage of the analysis from
        the low- and high-edge components (and nowhere else). You should verify
        that automatically detected components are in the correct  locations
        and that you can account for all components; to do so, you can list
        (CMLIST) or plot (CMPLOT) the components.

        If you issue the CYCLIC command after meshing and have defined element
        types with rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs), ANSYS generates cyclic
        CEs for rotational DOFs that may not exist on the sector boundaries.
        Issue the CYCOPT,DOF command to prevent unused rotational terms from
        being generated.

        Modal cyclic symmetry analysis is supported by the following
        eigensolvers:

        Block Lanczos (MODOPT,LANB)

        PCG Lanczos (MODOPT,LANPCG)

        Super Node (MODOPT,SNODE)

        Subspace (MODOPT,SUBSP)

        When using the: CYCLIC: command to automatically detect the sector, if

        sename
            The name (case-sensitive) of the file containing the original
            superelement matrix created by the generation pass (Sename.SUB).
            The default is the current Jobname.  If Sename is a number, it is
            the element number of a previously defined superelement in the
            current use pass.

        kcnto
            The reference number of the coordinate system to where the
            superelement is to be transferred. The default is the global
            Cartesian system.  Transfer occurs from the active coordinate
            system.

        inc
            The node offset.  The default is zero.  All new element node
            numbers are offset from those on the original by INC.

        file
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        dx, dy, dz
            Node location increments in the global Cartesian coordinate system.
            Defaults to zero.

        norot
            Node rotation key:

            0 - The nodal coordinate systems of the transferred superelement rotate into the
                KCNTO system. (That is, the nodal coordinate systems rotate
                with the superelement.) The superelement matrices remain
                unchanged. This value is the default.

            1 - The nodal coordinate systems do not rotate. (That is, they remain fixed in
                their original global orientation.)  The superelement matrices
                and load vectors are modified if any rotations occur.

        Notes
        -----
        The SETRAN command creates a superelement from an existing superelement
        and writes the new element to a file.  You can then issue an SE command
        to read the new element (during the use pass).

        You can create a superelement from an original by:

        Transferring the original's geometry from the active coordinate system
        into another coordinate system (KCNTO)

        Offsetting its geometry in the global Cartesian coordinate system (DX,
        DY, and DZ )

        Offsetting its node numbers (INC).

        A combination of methods is valid. If you specify both the geometry
        transfer and the geometry offset, the transfer occurs first.

        If you specify rotation of the transferred superelement's nodal
        coordinate systems into the KCNTO system (NOROT = 0), the rotated nodes
        cannot be coupled via the CP command; in this case, issue the CE
        command instead. If you specify no rotation of the nodal coordinate
        systems (NOROT = 1) for models with displacement degrees of freedom,
        and KCNTO is not the active system, the superelement Sename must have
        six MDOF at each node that has MDOF; therefore, only elements with all
        six structural DOFs are valid in such cases.

        There is no limit to the number of copies that can be made of a
        superelement, provided the copies are all generated from the same
        original superelement. However, nested copies are limited to five. In
        other words, the total number of different Sename usages on the SETRAN
        and SESYMM commands is limited to five.

        Parameters
        ----------
        --
            Unused field

        memory_option
            Memory allocation option:

            DEFAULT - Use the default memory allocation strategy for the sparse solver. The default
                      strategy attempts to run in the INCORE memory mode. If
                      there is not enough available physical memory when the
                      solver starts to run in the INCORE memory mode, the
                      solver will then attempt to run in the OUTOFCORE memory
                      mode.

            INCORE -  Use a memory allocation strategy in the sparse solver that will attempt to
                     obtain enough memory to run with the entire factorized
                     matrix in memory. This option uses the most amount of
                     memory and should avoid doing any I/O. By avoiding I/O,
                     this option achieves optimal solver performance. However,
                     a significant amount of memory is required to run in this
                     mode, and it is only recommended on machines with a large
                     amount of memory. If the allocation for in-core memory
                     fails, the solver will automatically revert to out-of-core
                     memory mode.

            OUTOFCORE - Use a memory allocation strategy in the sparse solver that will attempt to
                        allocate only enough work space to factor each
                        individual frontal matrix in memory, but will store the
                        entire factorized matrix on disk. Typically, this
                        memory mode results in poor performance due to the
                        potential bottleneck caused by the I/O to the various
                        files written by the solver.

            FORCE - This option, when used in conjunction with the Memory_Size option, allows you
                    to force the sparse solver to run with a specific amount of
                    memory. This option is only recommended for the advanced
                    user who understands sparse solver memory requirements for
                    the problem being solved, understands the physical memory
                    on the system, and wants to control the sparse solver
                    memory usage.

        memory_size
            Initial memory size allocation for the sparse solver in MB. This
            argument allows you to tune the sparse solver memory and is not
            generally required. Although there is no upper limit for
            Memory_Size, the Memory_Size setting should always be well within
            the physical memory available, but not so small as to cause the
            sparse solver to run out of memory. Warnings and/or errors from the
            sparse solver will appear if this value is set too low. If the
            FORCE memory option is used, this value is the amount of memory
            allocated for the entire duration of the sparse solver solution.

        --, --
            Unused fields

        solve_info
            Solver output option:

            OFF - Turns off additional output printing from the sparse solver (default).

            PERFORMANCE - Turns on additional output printing from the sparse solver, including a
                          performance summary and a summary of file I/O for the
                          sparse solver. Information on memory usage during
                          assembly of the global matrix (that is, creation of
                          the Jobname.FULL file) is also printed with this
                          option.

        Notes
        -----
        This command controls options related to the sparse solver in all
        analysis types where the sparse solver can be used. It also controls
        the Block Lanczos eigensolver in a modal or buckling analysis.

        The sparse solver runs from one large work space (that is, one large
        memory allocation). The amount of memory required for the sparse solver
        is unknown until the matrix structure is preprocessed, including
        equation reordering. The amount of memory allocated for the sparse
        solver is then dynamically adjusted to supply the solver what it needs
        to compute the solution.

        If you have a very large memory system, you may want to try selecting
        the INCORE memory mode for larger jobs to improve performance. When
        running the sparse solver on a machine with very slow I/O performance
        (for example, slow hard drive speed), you may want to try using the
        INCORE memory mode to achieve better performance. However, doing so may
        require much more memory compared to running in the OUTOFCORE memory
        mode.

        Running with the INCORE memory mode is best for jobs which comfortably
        fit within the limits of the physical memory on a given system. If the
        sparse solver work space exceeds physical memory size, the system will
        be forced to use virtual memory (or the system page/swap file). In this
        case, it is typically more efficient to run with the OUTOFCORE memory
        mode. Assuming the job fits comfortably within the limits of the
        machine, running with the INCORE memory mode is often ideal for jobs
        where repeated solves are performed for a single matrix factorization.
        This occurs in a modal or buckling analysis or when doing multiple load
        steps in a linear, static analysis.

        For repeated runs with the sparse solver, you may set the initial
        sparse solver memory allocation to the amount required for
        factorization. This strategy reduces the frequency of allocation and
        reallocation in the run to make the INCORE option fully effective. If
        you have a very large memory system, you may use the Memory_Size
        argument to increase the maximum size attempted for in-core runs.

        APDL Command: AVPRIN

        Parameters
        ----------
        key
            Averaging key:

            0 - Average the component values from the elements at a common node, then calculate
                the principal or vector sum from the averaged components
                (default).

            1 - Calculate the principal or vector sum values on a per element basis, then
                average these values from the elements at a common node.

        effnu
            Effective Poisson's ratio used for computing the von Mises
            equivalent strain (EQV). This command option is intended for use
            with line elements or in load case operations (LCOPER) only; ANSYS
            automatically selects the most appropriate effective Poisson's
            ratio, as discussed below.

        Notes
        -----
        Selects the method of combining components for certain derived nodal
        results when two or more elements connect to a common node.  The
        methods apply to the calculations of derived nodal principal stresses,
        principal strains, and vector sums for selects, sorts, and output
        [NSEL, NSORT, PRNSOL, PLNSOL, etc.].

        This command also defines the effective Poisson's ratio (EFFNU) used
        for equivalent strain calculations.  If you use EFFNU, the default
        effective Poisson's ratios shown below will be overridden for all
        elements by the EFFNU value. To return to the default settings, issue
        the RESET command. The default value for EFFNU is:

        Poisson's ratio as defined on the MP commands for EPEL and EPTH

        0.5 for EPPL and EPCR

        0.5 if the referenced material is hyperelastic

        0.0 for line elements (includes beam, link, and pipe elements, as well
        as discrete elements), cyclic symmetry analysis, mode superposition
        analyses (with MSUPkey = YES on the MXPAND command), and load case
        operations (LCOPER).

        For the von Mises equivalent strain (EQV), it is always computed using
        the average of the equivalent strains from the elements at a common
        node irrespective of the value of the averaging KEY. If EFFNU is input,
        though, the calculation will be performed according to the KEY setting.

        For a random vibration (PSD) analysis, issuing either AVPRIN,0 or
        AVPRIN,1 calculates the principal stresses using the appropriate
        averaging method. They are then used to determine SEQV.  The output
        will have non-zero values for the principal stresses.

        If AVPRIN is not issued, the Segalman-Fulcher method is used to
        calculate SEQV. This method does not calculate principal stresses, but
        directly calculates SEQV from the component stresses; therefore, the
        output will have zero values for the principal stresses. Beam and pipe
        elements are excluded

        This command is also valid in POST26, where applicable.

            1 - Result consistency is required

        ncpu
            Number of processors to use (applicable only with Option = SMP)

        Notes
        -----
        The EDRUN command specifies either serial (one CPU) processing or
        shared (multiple CPU) memory parallel processing (SMP). When using SMP,
        the calculations may be executed in a different order, depending on CPU
        availability and the load on each CPU. You may therefore see slight
        differences in the results when running the same job multiple times,
        either with the same number or a different number of processors.
        Comparing nodal accelerations often shows wider discrepancies. To avoid
        such differences, you can specify that consistency be maintained by
        setting CONS = 1. Maintaining consistency can result in an increase of
        up to 15 percent in CPU time.

        The parallel processing setting is only effective when you have
        multiple CPUs and licenses for the appropriate number of ANSYS LS-DYNA
        SMP tasks. If your site does not meet both requirements, the EDRUN
        command sets serial processing, regardless of command settings.

        For more information on using SMP, see Solution Features in the ANSYS
        LS-DYNA User's Guide.

        Defines an element by its nodes and attribute values. Up to 8 nodes may
        be specified with the E command.  If more nodes are needed for the
        element, use the EMORE command. The number of nodes required and the
        order in which they should be specified are described in Chapter 4 of
        the Element Reference for each element type.  Elements are
        automatically assigned a number [NUMSTR] as generated. The current (or
        default) MAT, TYPE, REAL, SECNUM and ESYS attribute values are also
        assigned to the element.

        When creating elements with more than 8 nodes using this command and
        the EMORE command, it may be necessary to turn off shape checking using
        the SHPP command before issuing this command. If a valid element type
        can be created without using the additional nodes on the EMORE command,
        this command will create that element. The EMORE command will then
        modify the element to include the additional nodes. If shape checking
        is active, it will be performed before the EMORE command is issued.
        Therefore, if the shape checking limits are exceeded, element creation
        may fail before the EMORE command modifies the element into an

        APDL Command: CEINTF

        Generates constraint equations at an interface.

        Parameters
        ----------
        toler
            Tolerance about selected elements, based on a fraction of the
            element dimension (defaults to 0.25 (25%)).  Nodes outside the
            element by more than the tolerance are not accepted as being on the
            interface.

        dof1, dof2, dof3, . . . , dof6
            Degrees of freedom for which constraint equations are written.
            Defaults to all applicable DOFs.  DOF1 accepts ALL as a valid
            label, in which case the rest are ignored (all DOFs are applied).

        movetol
            The allowed "motion" of a node (see Note below).  This distance is
            in terms of the element coordinates (-1.0 to 1.0).  A typical value
            is 0.05.  Defaults to 0 (do not move).  MoveTol must be less than
            or equal to TOLER.

        Notes
        -----
        This command can be used to "tie" together two regions with dissimilar
        mesh patterns by generating constraint equations that connect the
        selected nodes of one region to the selected elements of the other
        region.  At the interface between regions, nodes should be selected
        from the more dense mesh region, A, and the elements selected from the
        less dense mesh region, B.  The degrees of freedom of region A nodes
        are interpolated with the corresponding degrees of freedom of the nodes
        on the region B elements, using the shape functions of the region B
        elements.  Constraint equations are then written that relate region A
        and B nodes at the interface.

        The MoveTol field lets the nodes in the previously mentioned region A
        change coordinates when slightly inside or outside the elements of
        region B.  The change in coordinates causes the nodes of region A to
        assume the same surface as the nodes associated with the elements of
        region B.   The constraint equations that relate the nodes at both
        regions of the interface are then written.

        Solid elements with six degrees of freedom should only be interfaced
        with other six degree-of-freedom elements.  The region A nodes should
        be near the region B elements.   A location tolerance based on the
        smallest region B element length may be input.  Stresses across the
        interface are not necessarily continuous.  Nodes in the interface
        region should not have specified constraints.

        Use the CPINTF command to connect nodes by coupling instead of
        constraint equations.  Use the EINTF command to connect nodes by line
        elements.  See also the NSEL and ESEL commands for selecting nodes and
        elements.  See the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for a description
        of 3-D space used to determine if a node will be considered by this
        command.

        As an alternative to the CEINTF command, you can use contact elements
        and the internal multipoint constraint (MPC) algorithm to tie together
        two regions having dissimilar meshes. See Solid-Solid and Shell-Shell
        Assemblies for more information.

        descriptor for each data item written.  The write operation uses your
        system's available FORTRAN FORMAT conventions (see your system FORTRAN
        manual).  You can use any standard FORTRAN real format (such as
        (4F6.0), (E10.3,2X,D8.2), etc.) and alphanumeric format (A).
        Alphanumeric strings are limited to a maximum of 8 characters for any
        field (A8) using the Fortran format. Use the “C” format for string
        arrays larger than 8 characters. Integer (I) and list-directed (*)
        descriptors may not be used.  You can include text in the format as a
        quoted string.  The parentheses must be included in the format and the
        format must not exceed 80 characters (including parentheses).  The
        output line length is limited to 128 characters.

        The “C” format descriptors are used if the first character of the
        format descriptor line is not a left parenthesis. “C” format
        descriptors are up to 80 characters long, consisting of text strings
        and predefined "data descriptors" between the strings where numeric or
        alphanumeric character data will be inserted.  The normal descriptors
        are %I for integer data, %G for double precision data, %C for
        alphanumeric character data, and %/ for a line break. There must be one
        data descriptor for each specified value (8 maximum) in the order of
        the specified values. The enhanced formats described in *MSG may also
        be used.

        For array parameter items, you must define the starting array element
        number. Looping continues (incrementing the vector index number of each
        array parameter by one) each time you output a line, until the maximum
        array vector element is written.  For example, *VWRITE,A(1) followed by
        (F6.0) will write one value per output line, i.e., A(1), A(2), A(3),
        A(4), etc.  You write constants and scalar parameters with the same
        values for each loop.  You can also control the number of loops and
        loop skipping with the *VLEN and *VMASK commands.  The vector
        specifications *VABS,  *VFACT, and *VCUM  do not apply to this command.
        If looping continues beyond the supplied data array's length, zeros
        will be output for numeric array parameters and blanks for character
        array parameters.  For multi-dimensioned array parameters, only the
        first (row) subscript is incremented.  See the *VOPER command for
        details.  If you are in the GUI, the *VWRITE command must be contained
        in an externally prepared file and read into ANSYS (i.e., *USE, /INPUT,
        etc.).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        APDL Command: PRCAMP

        Prints Campbell diagram data for applications involving rotating

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Flag to activate or deactivate sorting of forward or backward whirl
            frequencies:

            0 (OFF or NO) - No sorting.

            1 (ON or YES) - Sort. This value is the default.

        slope
            The slope of the line to be printed. This value must be positive.

            SLOPE > 0  - The line represents the number of excitations per revolution of the rotor. For
                         example, SLOPE = 1 represents one excitation per
                         revolution, usually resulting from unbalance.

            SLOPE = 0  - The line represents the stability threshold for stability values or logarithmic
                         decrements printout (STABVAL = 1 or 2)

        unit
            Specifies the unit of measurement for rotational angular
            velocities:

            RDS - Rotational angular velocities in radians per second (rad/s). This value is the
                  default.

            RPM - Rotational angular velocities in revolutions per minute (RPMs).

        freqb
            The beginning, or lower end, of the frequency range of interest.
            The default is zero.

        cname
            The rotating component name.

        stabval
            Flag to print the stability values:

            0 (OFF or NO) - Print the frequencies (the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in Hz). This
                            value is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Print the stability values (the real parts of the eigenvalues in Hz).

            2 - Print the logarithmic decrements.

        keyallfreq
            Key to specify if all frequencies above FREQB are printed out:

            0 (OFF or NO) - A maximum of 10 frequencies are printed out. They correspond to the frequencies
                            displayed via the PLCAMP command. This value is the
                            default.

            1 (ON or YES) - All frequencies are printed out.

        keynegfreq
            Key to specify if the negative frequencies are printed out. It only
            applies to solutions obtained with the damped eigensolver
            (Method=DAMP on the MODOPT command):

            0 (OFF or NO) - Only positive frequencies are printed out. This value is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Negative and positive frequencies are printed out.

        Notes
        -----
        The following items are required when generating a Campbell diagram:

        Take the gyroscopic effect into account by issuing the CORIOLIS command
        in the SOLUTION module.

        Run a modal analysis using the QR damped (MODOPT,QRDAMP) or damped
        (MODOPT,DAMP) method. Complex eigenmodes are necessary
        (MODOPT,QRDAMP,,,,Cpxmod  = ON), and you must specify the number of
        modes to expand (MXPAND).

        Define two or more load step results with an ascending order of
        rotational velocity (OMEGA or CMOMEGA).

        In some cases where modes are not in the same order from one load step
        to the other, sorting the frequencies (Option = 1) can help to obtain a
        correct printout. Sorting is based on the comparison between complex
        mode shapes calculated at two successive load steps.

        At each load step, the application compares the mode shape to the loads
        to determine the whirl direction. If applicable, a label appears (on
        the rows of output data) representing the whirl mode (BW for backward
        whirl and FW for forward whirl).

        If you specify a non-zero slope (SLOPE > 0), the command prints the
        critical speeds corresponding to the intersection points of the
        frequency curves and the added line. In the case of a named component
        (Cname), critical speeds relate to the rotational velocity of the
        component. Critical speeds are available only if the frequencies are
        printed (STABVAL = OFF).

        If you specify a zero slope (SLOPE = 0), the command prints the
        stability threshold corresponding to the sign change of the stability
        values (or logarithmic decrements). In the case of a named component
        (Cname), stability thresholds relate to the rotational velocity of the
        component. Stability thresholds are available only if the stability
        values or logarithmic decrements are printed (STABVAL = 1 or 2).

        At each load step, the program checks for instability (based on the
        sign of the real part of the eigenvalue). The label “U” appears on the
        printout for each unstable frequency.

        If specified, the rotational velocities of the named component (Cname)
        are printed out along with the natural frequencies.

        In general, printing a Campbell diagram is recommended only when your
        analysis is performed in a stationary reference frame
        (CORIOLIS,,,,RefFrame = ON).

        name
            The 32-character user-specified name.

        item, comp
            Predetermined output item and component label for valid elements.
            See the Element Reference for more information.

        node
            Number identifying one of the following:

        elem
            Valid element number for element results. Used for ESOL items. If
            ELEM is specified, then a node number that belongs to the element
            must also be specified in the NODE field.

        shell
            Valid labels are TOP, MID or BOT. This field can specify the
            location on shell elements for which to retrieve data. Used only
            for element nodal data (ESOL).

        layer
            Layer number (for layered elements only). Used only for element
            nodal data (ESOL).

        stop_value
            Critical value of the tracked variable. This value is used to
            determine if the analysis should be terminated. This field is only
            valid for contact data (Key = PAIR or GCN).

        stop_cond
            Specifies the conditional relationship between the variable being
            tracked and the STOP_VALUE upon which the analysis will be
            terminated:

            -1 - Terminate the analysis when the tracked variable is less than or equal to
                 STOP_VALUE.

            0 - Terminate the analysis when the tracked variable equals STOP_VALUE.

            1 - Terminate the analysis when the tracked variable is greater than or equal to
                STOP_VALUE.

        Notes
        -----
        The NLHIST command is a nonlinear diagnostics tool that enables you to
        monitor diagnostics results of interest in real time during a solution.

        You can track a maximum of 50 variables during solution. The specified
        result quantities are written to the file Jobname.nlh. Nodal results
        and contact results are written for every converged substep
        (irrespective of the OUTRES command setting) while element results are
        written only at time points specified via the OUTRES command. For time
        points where element results data is not available, a very small number
        is written instead. If the conditions for contact to be established are
        not satisfied, 0.0 will be written for contact results.

        Results tracking is available only for a nonlinear structural analysis
        (static or transient), a nonlinear steady-state thermal analysis, or a
        transient thermal analysis (linear or nonlinear). All results are
        tracked in the Solution Coordinate System (that is, nodal results are
        in the nodal coordinate system and element results are in the element
        coordinate system).

        Contact results can be tracked for elements CONTA171 through CONTA177;
        they cannot be tracked for CONTA178.

        When contact results are tracked (Key = PAIR or GCN), the user-
        specified name (Name argument) is used to create a user-defined
        parameter. This enables you to monitor the parameter during solution.
        As an example, you can use a named parameter to easily convert the
        contact stiffness units from FORCE/LENGTH3 to FORCE/LENGTH based on the
        initial contact area CAREA. Be sure to specify Name using the APDL
        parameter naming convention.

        The STOP_VALUE and STOP_COND arguments enable you to automatically
        terminate the analysis when a desired value for a tracked contact
        result has been reached. This capability is only available for contact
        variables (Key = PAIR or GCN).

        The Jobname.nlh file is an ASCII file that lists each time point at
        which a converged solution occurs along with the values of the relevant
        result quantities.

        The GUI option Solution> Results tracking provides an interface to
        define the result items to be tracked. The GUI also allows you to graph
        one or more variables against time or against other variables during
        solution. You can use the interface to graph or list variables from any
        .nlh file generated by the ANSYS program.

        You can also track results during batch runs. Either access the ANSYS
        Launcher and select File Tracking from the Tools menu, or type
        nlhist162 at the command line. Use the supplied file browser to
        navigate to your Jobname.nlh file, and click on it to invoke the
        tracking utility. You can use this utility to read the file at any
        time, even after the solution is complete (the data in the file must be
        formatted correctly).

        MSAVE,ON only applies to and is the default for parts of the model
        using the following element types with linear material properties that
        meet the conditions listed below.

        SOLID186 (Structural Solid only)

        SOLID187

        The following conditions must also be true:

        The PCG solver has been specified.

        Small strains are assumed (NLGEOM,OFF).

        No prestress effects (PSTRES) are included.

        All nodes on the supported element types must be defined (i.e., the
        midside nodes cannot be removed using the EMID command).

        For elements with thermally dependent material properties, MSAVE,ON
        applies only to elements with uniform temperatures prescribed.

        The default element coordinate system must be used.

        If you manually force MSAVE,ON by including it in the input file, the
        model can include the following additional conditions:

        The analysis can be a modal analysis using the PCG Lanczos method
        (MODOPT,LANPCG).

        Large deflection effects (NLGEOM,ON) are included.

        SOLID185 (brick shapes and KEYOPT(2) = 3 only) elements can be
        included.

        All other element types or other parts of the model that don't meet the
        above criteria will be solved using global assembly (MSAVE,OFF). This
        command can result in memory savings of up to 70 percent over the
        global assembly approach for the part of the model that meets the
        criteria. Depending on the hardware (e.g., processor speed, memory
        bandwidth, etc.), the solution time may increase or decrease when this
        feature is used.

        This memory-saving feature runs in parallel when multiple processors
        are used with the /CONFIG command or with Distributed ANSYS. The gain
        in performance with using multiple processors with this feature turned
        on should be similar to the default case when this feature is turned
        off. Performance also improves when using the uniform reduced
        integration option for SOLID186 elements.

        This command does not support the layered option of the SOLID185 and
        SOLID186 elements.

        When using MSAVE,ON with the PCGOPT command, note the following
        restrictions:

        For static and modal analyses, MSAVE,ON is not valid when using a
        Lev_Diff value of 5 on the PCGOPT command; Lev_Diff will automatically
        be reset to 2.

        For modal analyses, MSAVE,ON is not valid with the StrmCk option of the
        PCGOPT command; Strmck will be set to OFF.

        For all analysis types, MSAVE,ON is not valid when the Lagrange
        multiplier option (LM_Key) of the PCGOPT command is set to ON; the
        MSAVE activation key will be set to OFF.

        For linear perturbation static and modal analyses, MSAVE,ON is not
        valid; the MSAVE activation key will be set to OFF.

        When using MSAVE,ON for modal analyses, no .FULL file will be created.
        The .FULL file may be necessary for subsequent analyses (e.g.,
        harmonic, transient mode-superposition, or spectrum analyses). To
        generate the .FULL file, rerun the modal analysis using the WRFULL
        command.

        APDL Command: IC

        Specifies initial conditions at nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        node
            Node at which initial condition is to be specified.  If ALL, apply
            to all selected nodes (NSEL).  If NODE = P, graphical picking is
            enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in
            the GUI). A component name may be substituted for NODE.

        lab
            Degree-of-freedom label for which the initial condition is to be
            specified.  If ALL, use all appropriate labels.

        value
            Initial value of the degree of freedom (first-order value).
            Defaults to the program default for that degree of freedom (0.0 for
            structural analysis, TUNIF for thermal analysis, etc.). Values are
            in the nodal coordinate system and in radians for rotational
            degrees of freedom.

        value2
            Second-order degree of freedom value, mainly used to specify
            initial structural velocity.  Defaults to the program default for
            that degree of freedom (0.0 for structural analysis).  Values are
            in the nodal coordinate system and in radians/time for rotational
            degrees of freedom.

        nend, ninc
            Specifies the same initial condition values at the range of nodes
            from NODE to NEND (defaults to NODE), in steps of NINC (defaults to
            1).

        Notes
        -----
        The IC command specifies initial conditions, which are the initial
        values of the specified degrees of freedom. It is valid only for a
        static analysis and full method transient analysis (TIMINT,ON and
        TRNOPT,FULL). For the transient, the initial value is specified at the
        beginning of the first load step, that is, at time = 0.0.

        Initial conditions should always be step applied (KBC,1) and not
        ramped.

        If constraints (D, DSYM, etc.) and initial conditions are applied at
        the same node, the constraint specification overrides. Exercise caution
        when specifying constraints. The degree-of-freedom values start from
        zero, or the first value given in the table when table name is
        specified. To match the nonzero initial condition value with the
        initial value for degree-of-freedom constraint, use a table for the
        degree-of-freedom constraint.

        For thermal analyses, any TUNIF specification should be applied before
        the IC command; otherwise, the TUNIF specification is ignored.  If the
        IC command is input before any TUNIF specification, use the ICDELE
        command and then reissue any TUNIF specification and then follow with
        the IC command.

        When issuing the IC command for elements SOLID278 Layered Thermal Solid
        and SOLID279 Layered Thermal Solid with through-the-thickness degrees
        of freedom (KEYOPT(3) = 2), layers are always interpolated linearly
        based on the location of the degrees of freedom.

        Define consistent initial conditions. For example, if you define an
        initial velocity at a single degree of freedom, the initial velocity at
        every other degree of freedom will be 0.0, potentially leading to
        conflicting initial conditions. In most cases, you should define
        initial conditions at every unconstrained degree of freedom in your
        model. If you define an initial condition for any degree of freedom at
        the pilot node of a rigid body (see Modeling Rigid Bodies in the
        Contact Technology Guide for the definition of rigid body), then the
        same initial condition must also be defined for the same degree of
        freedom on all other nodes of the rigid body.

        After a solution has been performed, the specified initial conditions
        are overwritten by the actual solution and are no longer available. You
        must respecify them if you want to perform a subsequent analysis. You
        may want to keep a database file saved prior to the first solution for
        subsequent reuse.

        If you use the CDWRITE command to archive your model, first-order
        values (initial displacements, temperatures, etc.) specified via the IC
        command are not written to the archive file; however, second-order
        (structural velocity) terms are written.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

            MCS - Monte Carlo Simulation

            RSM - Response Surface Method

        samp
            Label for the sampling techniques. The sampling technique
            determines the values of the random input variables during the
            simulation loops.

            DIR - Direct or Crude Monte Carlo Sampling. This technique randomly samples the
                  random input variables according to their distribution
                  functions without "memory" of previous simulations.

            The parameters for a Monte Carlo Simulation using direct sampling are specified with the PDDMCS command. - LHS

            Latin Hypercube Sampling (default). Valid only for Method = MCS. For this sampling technique the random input variables are sampled randomly according to their distribution functions, efficiently stratifying the samples into layers and avoiding the re-use of those layers. The sampling process has a "memory" of previous simulations, which prevents accumulation of clusters of samples. In addition, this sampling strategy forces the extreme ends of a distribution function to participate in the sampling. This generally leads to smoother distribution functions of the sampled set. - The parameters for a Monte Carlo Simulation using Latin-Hypercube sampling are
                              specified with the PDLHS command.

            USER - User specified sampling. Valid only for Method = MCS. In this case you provide
                   a file containing the sampling "points" (values) of all
                   random input variables for all simulation loops. These
                   samples are simply executed and it is your responsibility to
                   specify the samples correctly. The probabilistic design
                   system can perform only limited checks on the samples you
                   provide. ANSYS allows Monte Carlo specific postprocessing
                   operations on the results generated with user-specified
                   samples. The parameters for the user-supplied sampling
                   technique are specified with the PDUSER command.

            CCD - Central Composite Design. Valid only for Method = RSM. A central composite
                  design is composed of a center point, axis points, and corner
                  points, called factorial points. Using large numbers of
                  random input variables produces prohibitively large numbers
                  of factorial points; therefore, ANSYS automatically reduces
                  the number of factorial points by switching to a fractional
                  plan for the factorial part of the design. See the PDDOEL
                  command for more information.

            Note:This option is only valid for 2 to 20 random input variables. You will receive an error if you have specified fewer than 2 or more than 20 random input variables. - BBM

            Box-Behnken Matrix Design. Valid only for Method = RSM. A Box-Behnken Matrix design is composed of a center point plus the points at the middle of the edges of the hypercube in the space of random input variables. A Box-Behnken design might be advantageous if the corner points of the hypercube represent very extreme conditions that are undesirable and therefore should not be used for the sampling.  See the PDDOEL command for more information. - Note:  This option is only valid for 3 to 12 random input variables. You will
                              receive an error if you have specified fewer than
                              3 or more than 12 random input variables.

            USER - User specified sampling. In this case you provide a file containing the
                   sampling "points" (values) of all random input variables for
                   all simulation loops. These samples are simply executed and
                   it is your responsibility to specify the samples correctly.
                   The PDS can perform only limited checks on the samples you
                   provide, if user-supplied sampling technique are specified
                   with the PDUSER command.

        action
            Action to be performed:

            Define - Define a view factor summation (default)

            Clear - Resets the scaling method to 0 for all enclosures. All subsequent arguments are
                    ignored.

            Status - Outputs the OPT value for each enclosure in the model.

        encl
            Previously defined enclosure number for the view factor adjustment.

        opt
            Option key:

            0 - The view factor matrix values are not adjusted (default).

            1 - The view factor matrix values are adjusted so that the row sum equals 1.0.

            2 - The view factor matrix values are adjusted so that the row sum equals 1.0 and
                the reciprocity relationship is satisfied.

            3 - The view factor matrix values are adjusted so that the original row sum is
                maintained.

            4 - The view factor matrix values are adjusted so that the original row sum is
                maintained and the reciprocity relationship is satisfied.

        maxiter
            Maximum number of iterations to achieve convergence. Valid only
            when OPT = 2 or 4. Default is 100.

        conv
            Convergence value for row sum. Iterations will continue (up to
            MAXITER) until the maximum residual over all the rows is less than
            this value. Valid only when OPT = 2 or 4. Default is 1E-3.

        -----
        To have a good energy balance, it is important to satisfy both the row
        sum and reciprocity relationships. For more information, see View
        Factors in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference.

        OPT = 1 and 2 are suitable for perfect enclosures. OPT = 1 is less

        Parameters

            Real constant set identification number (arbitrary).  If same as a
            previous set number, set is redefined. Set number relates to that

            thickness, etc., as required for the particular element type using
            this set), or table names for tabular input of boundary conditions.

            input.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines the element real constants.  The real constants required for an
        element are shown in the Input Summary of each element description in
        the Element Reference.  Constants must be input in the same order as
        shown in that table.  If more than the required number of element real
        constants are specified in a set, only those required are used.  If
        fewer than the required number are specified, zero values are assumed
        for the unspecified constants.

        If using table inputs (SURF151, SURF152, FLUID116, CONTA171, CONTA172,
        CONTA173, CONTA174, and CONTA175 only), enclose the table name in %

        Specify NSET = GCN to define real constants for real constant sets that
        were previously assigned by the GCDEF command (that is, real constants
        used in general contact interactions).

        When copying real constants to new sets, ANSYS, Inc. recommends that
        you use the command input. If you do use the GUI, restrict the real
        constant copy to only the first six real constants (real constants

        APDL Command: ANCYC

        Applies a traveling wave animation to graphics data in a modal cyclic
        symmetry analysis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        numframes
            The number of plot frames for the animation. Valid values range
            from 5 through 36. The default is 18. A low value (because it
            specifies fewer graphical frames) produces a rougher animation but
            loads faster. A high value produces a smoother animation but
            requires more time to load.

        kcycl
            The animation mode:

            0 - Continuous animation cycle (forward-reverse-forward).

            1 - Discontinuous animation cycle (forward-reset-forward). This option is the
                default.

        delay
            The time delay (in seconds) between animation frames. Valid values
            range from 0.1 through 1.0. The default is 0.1 seconds, which
            produces a seemingly real-time animation. A higher value produces a
            slower animation.

        Notes
        -----
        The ANCYC command is valid in a modal cyclic symmetry analysis only.

        The command animates the cyclic symmetry mode shape plot in the General
        Post Processor (/POST1). When you issue a nodal- or element-results
        plot command (for example, PLNSOL, PLESOL, or PLDISP) and then issue
        the ANCYC command, ANSYS applies a traveling wave animation to the mode
        shape plot.

        Each frame of the animation is created by expanding the cyclic symmetry
        mode shape at increasing phase angles (via the /CYCEXPAND command)
        starting at zero in equal increments over 360°. The phase-angle
        increment is 360 / NUMFRAMES.

        The animation display shows the traveling wave of the result quantity
        being plotted. The traveling wave animation is applicable only to nodal
        diameters (harmonic indices) greater than 0 and less than N / 2 (where
        N is the number of cyclic sectors in the model).

        APDL Command: OCDATA

        Defines an ocean load using non-table data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        val1, val2, val3, . . . , val14
            Values describing the basic ocean load or a wave condition.

        Notes
        -----
        The OCDATA command specifies non-table data that defines the ocean
        load, such as the depth of the ocean to the mud line, the ratio of
        added mass over added mass for a circular cross section, or the wave
        type to apply. The terms VAL1, VAL2, etc. are specialized according to
        the input set required for the given ocean load.

        The program interprets the data input via the OCDATA command within the
        context of the most recently issued OCTYPE command.

        Input values in the order indicated.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        You can define the following ocean data types:

        For a better understanding of how to set up a basic ocean type, see
        Figure: 5:: Basic Ocean Data Type Components .

        DEPTH -- The depth of the ocean (that is, the distance between the mean
        sea level and the mud line). The water surface is assumed to be level
        in the XY plane, with Z being positive upwards. This value is required
        and must be positive.

        MATOC -- The material number of the ocean. This value is required and
        is used to input the required density. It is also used to input the
        viscosity if the Reynolds number is used (OCTABLE).

        KFLOOD -- The inside-outside fluid-interaction key:

        For beam subtype CTUBE and HREC used with BEAM188 or BEAM189 and ocean
        loading, KFLOOD is always set to 1.

        Cay -- The ratio of added mass of the external fluid over the mass of
        the fluid displaced by the element cross section in the y direction
        (normal). The added mass represents the mass of the external fluid
        (ocean water) that moves with the pipe, beam, or link element when the
        element moves in the element y direction during a dynamic analysis.

        If no value is specified, and the coefficient of inertia CMy is not
        specified (OCTABLE), both values default to 0.0.

        If no value is specified, but CMy is specified, this value defaults to
        Cay = CMy - 1.0.

        If this value should be 0.0, enter 0.0.

        Caz -- The ratio of added mass of the external fluid over the mass of a
        cross section in the element z direction (normal). The added mass
        represents the mass of the external fluid (ocean water) that moves with
        the pipe, beam, or link element when the element moves in the element z
        direction during a dynamic analysis.

        If no value is specified, and Cay is specified, this value defaults to
        Cay.

        If no value is specified, and the coefficient of inertia CMz is not
        specified (OCTABLE), both values default to 0.0.

        If no value is specified, but CMz is specified, this value defaults to
        Cay = CMz - 1.0.

        If this value should be 0.0, enter 0.0.

        Cb -- The ratio of buoyancy force used over buoyancy force based on the
        outside diameter and water density. Accept the default value in most
        cases. Adjust this option only when you must account for additional
        hardware (such as a control valve) attached to the pipe exterior. A
        non-default value may lead to small non-physical inconsistencies;
        testing is therefore recommended for non-default values.

        If no value is specified, this value defaults to 1.0.

        If this value should be 0.0 (useful when troubleshooting your input),
        enter 0.0.

        Zmsl -- A vertical offset from the global origin to the mean sea level.
        The default value is zero (meaning that the origin is located at the
        mean sea level).

        Two example cases for Zmsl are:

        A structure with its origin on the sea floor (Zmsl = DEPTH).

        A tidal change (tc) above the mean sea level (Zmsl = tc, and DEPTH
        becomes DEPTH + tc)

        Ktable -- The dependency of VAL1 on the OCTABLE command:

        Figure: 5:: : Basic Ocean Data Type Components

         KWAVE -- The incident wave type:

        THETA -- Angle of the wave direction θ from the global Cartesian X axis
        toward the global Cartesian Y axis (in degrees).

        WAVELOC (valid when KWAVE = 0 through 3, and 101+) -- The wave location
        type:

        SPECTRUM (valid when KWAVE = 5 through 7) -- The wave spectrum type:

        KCRC -- The wave-current interaction key.

        Adjustments to the current profile are available via the KCRC constant
        of the water motion table. Typically, these options are used only when
        the wave amplitude is large relative to the water depth, such that
        significant wave-current interaction exists.

        slope
            The slope of the line to be printed. This value must be positive.

            SLOPE > 0  - The line represents the number of excitations per revolution of the rotor. For
                         example, SLOPE = 1 represents one excitation per
                         revolution, usually resulting from unbalance.

                         decrements printout (STABVAL = 1 or 2)

        unit
            Specifies the unit of measurement for rotational angular
            velocities:

            RDS - Rotational angular velocities in radians per second (rad/s). This value is the
                  default.

            RPM - Rotational angular velocities in revolutions per minute (RPMs).

        freqb
            The beginning, or lower end, of the frequency range of interest.
            The default is zero.

        cname
            The rotating component name.

        stabval
            Flag to plot the stability values:

            0 (OFF or NO) - Plot the frequencies (the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in Hz). This value
                            is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Plot the stability values (the real parts of the eigenvalues in Hz).

            2 - Plot the logarithmic decrements.

        keyallfreq

            0 (OFF or NO) - Only positive frequencies are plotted. This value is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Negative and positive frequencies are plotted.

        Notes
        -----
        The following items are required when generating a Campbell diagram:

        Take the gyroscopic effect into account by issuing the CORIOLIS command
        in the SOLUTION module.

        Run a modal analysis using the QR damped (MODOPT,QRDAMP) or damped
        (MODOPT,DAMP) method. Complex eigenmodes are necessary
        (MODOPT,QRDAMP,,,,Cpxmod  = ON), and you must specify the number of
        modes to expand (MXPAND).

        Define two or more load step results with an ascending order of
        rotational velocity (OMEGA or CMOMEGA).

        In some cases where modes are not in the same order from one load step
        to the other, sorting the frequencies (Option = 1) can help to obtain a
        correct plot. Sorting is based on the comparison between complex mode
        shapes calculated at two successive load steps.

        At each load step, the application compares the mode shape to the loads
        at other load steps to determine whirl direction at the load step. If
        applicable, a label appears (in the plot legend) representing each
        whirl mode (BW for backward whirl and FW for forward whirl).

        At each load step, the program checks for instability (based on the
        sign of the real part of the eigenvalue). The labels “stable” or
        “unstable” appear in the plot legend for each frequency curve.

        The rotational velocities of a named component (Cname) are displayed on
        the X-axis.

        For information on plotting a Campbell diagram for a prestressed
        structure, see Solving for a Subsequent Campbell Analysis of a
        Prestressed Structure Using the Linear Perturbation Procedure in the
        Rotordynamic Analysis Guide.

        In general, plotting a Campbell diagram is recommended only when your
        analysis is performed in a stationary reference frame
        (CORIOLIS,,,,RefFrame = ON).

            Reference number identifying the spotweld or generalized weld.

        n1, n2
            For a spotweld, N1 and N2 are the nodes which are connected by the
            spotweld. For a generalized weld, input a nodal component name in
            N1 and leave N2 blank. The nodal component should contain all nodes
            that are to be included in the generalized weld.

        sn
            Normal force at spotweld failure.

        ss
            Shear force at spotweld failure.

        expn
            Exponent for normal spotweld force.

        exps
            Exponent for shear spotweld force.

        epsf
            Effective plastic strain at ductile failure (used only for a
            generalized weld).

        tfail
            Failure time for constraint set (used only for a generalized weld);
            default = 1.0e20.

        nsw
            Number of spot welds for the generalized weld.

        cid
            Coordinate system ID number (CID) to be used for output data (used
            only for a generalized weld). The coordinate system must be
            previously defined with the EDLCS command.

        Notes
        -----
        This command can be used to define a massless spotweld between two
        nodes or a generalized weld for a group of nodes.  For a spotweld, the
        nodes specified by N1 and N2 must not be coincident. For a generalized
        weld, coincident nodes are permitted, but CID must be specified when
        using coincident nodes. EDWELD is not updated after a node merge
        operation; therefore, node merging [NUMMRG,NODE] should be done before
        any EDWELD definitions. Nodes connected by a spotweld or generalized
        weld cannot be constrained in any other way.

        Failure of the weld occurs when:

        where fn and fs are normal and shear interface forces. Normal interface
        force fn is nonzero for tensile values only.

        You can graphically display spotwelds by issuing the command
        /PBC,WELD,,1.

        This command is also valid in SOLUTION.

        dtms
            Time step size for mass scaled solutions (defaults to 0).

        tssfac
            Scale factor for computed time step. Defaults to 0.9; if high
            explosives are used, the default is lowered to 0.67.

        Notes
        -----
        If DTMS is positive, the same time step size will be used for all
        elements and mass scaling will be done for all elements.  Therefore,
        positive values should only be used if inertial effects are
        insignificant.

        If DTMS is negative, mass scaling is applied only to elements whose
        calculated time step size is smaller than DTMS.  Negative values should
        only be used in transient analyses if the mass increases are
        insignificant.

        In order to use mass scaling in an explicit dynamic small restart
        analysis (EDSTART,2) or full restart analysis (EDSTART,3), mass scaling
        must have been active in the original analysis. The time step and scale

        vect1
            Name of the first vector that contains the noisy data set (i.e.,
            independent variable). You must create and fill this vector before

        vect2
            Name of the second vector that contains the dependent set of data.
            Must be the same length as the first vector. You must create and
            fill this vector before issuing EDNDTSD.

        datap
            Number of data points to be fitted, starting from the beginning of
            the vector. If left blank, the entire vector will be fitted. The
            maximum number of data points is 100,000 (or greater, depending on
            the memory of the computer).

        fitpt
            Curve fitting order to be used as a smooth representation of the
            data. This number should be less than or equal to the number of
            data points. However, because high order polynomial curve fitting
            can cause numerical difficulties, a polynomial order less than 7 is
            suggested. The default (blank) is one-half the number of data
            points or 7, which ever is less. The following values are
            available:

            1 - Curve is the absolute average of all of the data points.

            2 - Curve is the least square average of all of the data points.

            3 or more - Curve is a polynomial of the order (n-1), where n is the number of data fitting
                        order points.

        vect3
            Name of the vector that contains the smoothed data of the
            independent variable. This vector should have a length equal to or
            greater than the number of smoothed data points. In batch (command)
            mode, you must create this vector before issuing the EDNDTSD
            command. In interactive mode, the GUI automatically creates this
            vector (if it does not exist). If you do not specify a vector name,
            the GUI will name the vector smth_ind.

        vect4
            Name of the vector that contains the smoothed data of the dependent

            (command) mode, you must create this vector before issuing the
            EDNDTSD command. In interactive mode, the GUI automatically creates
            this vector (if it does not exist). If you do not specify a vector
            name, the GUI will name the vector smth_dep.

        disp
            Specifies how you want to display data. No default; you must
            specify an option.

            1 - Unsmoothed data only

            2 - Smoothed data only

            3 - Both smoothed and unsmoothed data

        Notes
        -----
        You can control the attributes of the graph using standard ANSYS
        controls (/GRID, /GTHK, /COLOR, etc.). If working interactively, these
        controls appear in this dialog box for convenience, as well as in their
        standard dialog boxes. You must always create Vect1 and Vect2 (using
        *DIM) and fill these vectors before smoothing the data. If you're
        working interactively, ANSYS automatically creates Vect3 and Vect4, but
        if you're working in batch (command) mode, you must create Vect3 and
        Vect4 (using *DIM) before issuing EDNDTSD.  Vect3 and Vect4 are then
        filled automatically by ANSYS.  In addition, ANSYS creates an
        additional TABLE type array that contains the smoothed array and the
        unsmoothed data to allow for plotting later with *VPLOT.  Column 1 in
        this table corresponds to Vect1, column 2 to Vect2, and column 3 to
        Vect4.  This array is named Vect3_SMOOTH, up to a limit of 32

        Specifies a surface load "function" to be used when the SF or SFE
        command is issued.  The function is supplied through an array parameter
        vector which contains nodal surface load values.  Node numbers are
        implied from the sequential location in the array parameter.  For
        example, a value in location 11 applies to node 11.  The element faces
        are determined from the implied list of nodes when the SF or SFE
        command is issued.  Zero values should be supplied for nodes that have
        no load.  A tapered load value may be applied over the element face.
        These loads are in addition to any loads that are also specified with
        the SF or SFE commands.  Issue SFFUN (with blank remaining fields) to
        remove this specification.  Issue SFFUN,STATUS to list current
        settings.

        Element body loads are applied with the BFE command.  Issue the BFELIST
        command to list the element body loads.  The operations occur when the
        next body loads are defined.  For example, issuing the BFE command with
        a temperature value of 25 after a previous BFE command with a
        temperature value of 20 causes the new value of that temperature to be
        25 with the replace operation, or 20 with the ignore operation.  A
        scale factor is also available to multiply the next value before the
        replace operation.  A scale factor of 2.0 with the previous "replace"
        example results in a temperature of 50.  The scale factor is applied

            MXCE - Maximum number of constraint equations.  Default and expansion as for MXND.

            NOELDB - Option to write or not write results into the database after a solution.  When
                     VALUE = 0 (default), write results into the database.
                     When VALUE = 1, do not write results into the database.

            DYNA_DBL - Option to invoke the double precision version of the explicit dynamics solver
                       LS-DYNA. When VALUE = 0 (default), the single precision
                       version is used. When VALUE = 1, the double precision
                       version is used.

            STAT - Displays current values set by the /CONFIG command.

        value
            Value (an integer number) assigned to the configuration parameter.

        Notes
        -----
        All configuration parameters have initial defaults, which in most cases
        do not need to be changed.  Where a specially configured version of the
        ANSYS program is desired, the parameters may be changed with this
        command.  Issue /CONFIG,STAT to display current values.  Changes must
        be defined before the parameter is required.  These changes (and
        others) may also be incorporated into the config162.ans file which is
        read upon execution of the program (see The Configuration File in the
        Basic Analysis Guide).  If the same configuration parameter appears in
        both the  configuration file and this command, this command overrides.

        Distributed ANSYS uses the default FSPLIT value, and forces NOELDB = 1
        and NORSTGM = 0 for all results files. The FSPLIT, NOELDB, and NORSTGM
        options cannot be changed when using Distributed ANSYS.

        The /CONFIG command is not valid for the ANSYS Multiphysics 1, 2, or 3
        products.

        The ANSYS Multi-field solver (MFS and MFX) does not support
        /CONFIG,NOELDB,1. The ANSYS Multi-field solver needs the updated ANSYS
        database.

        Parameters
        ----------
        iel
            Element number (next available number by default).

        node
            Node number connecting support structure and turbine.

        damp
            Damping option for the turbine:

            0 - Damping matrix obtained from the aeroelastic code plus Rayleigh damping
                (default).

            1 - Rayleigh damping only.

            2 - Damping from the aeroelastic code only.

        Notes
        -----
        WTBCREATE invokes a predefined ANSYS macro that will automatically
        generate a turbine element and issue relevant data commands that are
        necessary to run a full aeroelastic coupling analysis. For detailed
        information on how to perform a fully coupled aeroelastic analysis, see
        Fully Coupled Wind Turbine Example in Mechanical APDL in the Mechanical
        APDL Programmer's Reference.

        The generated USER300 turbine element will have 9 nodes with node
        numbers NODE, NMAX+1, NMAX+2, ..., NMAX+8, where NMAX is the maximum
        node number currently in the model.

        There are 6 freedoms on the first node of the element: UX, UY, UZ,
        ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ, and these are true structural freedoms. For all the
        other nodes (i.e., nodes 2 to 9), only the translational freedoms (UX,
        UY, UZ) are used. These are generalized freedoms that are internal to
        the turbine element and are used by the aeroelastic code only.

        The element type integer of the USER300 element is the current maximum
        element type integer plus one.

        The command will also set up the analysis settings appropriate for a
        full aeroelastic coupling analysis. These include full Newton-Raphson
        solution (NROPT,FULL) and a USRCAL command to activate the relevant

        Parameters
        ----------
        nv1, nv2, ninc
            Set of volumes (NV1 to NV2 in steps of NINC) that defines the
            pattern to be scaled.  NV2 defaults to NV1, NINC defaults to 1.  If
            NV1 = ALL, NV2 and NINC are ignored and the pattern is defined by

            A component name may also be substituted for NV1 (NV2 and NINC are

        rx, ry, rz
            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates
            in active coordinate system (RR, Rθ, RZ for cylindrical; RR, Rθ, RΦ
            for spherical).  Note that the Rθ and RΦ scale factors are
            interpreted as angular offsets.  For example, if CSYS = 1, RX, RY,
            RZ input of (1.5,10,3) would scale the specified keypoints 1.5
            times in the radial and 3 times in the Z direction, while adding an
            offset of 10 degrees to the keypoints.  Zero, blank, or negative
            scale factor values are assumed to be 1.0.  Zero or blank angular
            offsets have no effect.

        kinc
            Increment to be applied to keypoint numbers for generated set.  If
            zero, the lowest available keypoint numbers will be assigned
            [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            0 - Nodes and elements associated with the original volumes will be generated
                (scaled) if they exist.

            1 - Nodes and elements will not be generated.

        imove
            Specifies whether volumes will be moved or newly defined:

            0 - Additional volumes will be generated.

            1 - Original volumes will be moved to new position (KINC and NOELEM are ignored).
                Use only if the old volumes are no longer needed at their

        REAL, and ESYS attributes are based on the volumes in the pattern and
        not the current settings.  Scaling is done in the active coordinate
        system.  Volumes in the pattern could have been generated in any

        The behavior of shell elements is governed by the generalized-
        stress/generalized-strain relationship of the form:

        If the coefficients B12, B13, B23 are undefined, ANSYS uses a symmetric
        form of submatrix [B].  If any one of the coefficients B12, B13, B23 is
        nonzero, ANSYS considers submatrix [B] to be unsymmetric.

        The SSPB command, one of several preintegrated shell section commands,
        specifies the coupling stiffness quantity (submatrix [B] data) for a
        preintegrated shell section. The section data defined is associated

            Sets a flag in the LS-DYNA input file (Fname.Ext) to produce
            desired output.

            ANSYS - Set a flag to write results files for the ANSYS postprocessors (default).  The

                     files that will be written are D3PLOT, and files specified
                     by EDOUT and EDHIST (see Notes below).

            BOTH - Set a flag to write results files for both ANSYS and LS-DYNA postprocessors.

        fname
            File name and directory path (80 characters maximum, including
            directory; this limit is due to an LS-DYNA program limitation). If
            you do not specify a directory path, it will default to your
            working directory. The file name defaults to Jobname. Previous data
            on this file, if any, are overwritten.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        This command writes an LS-DYNA input file for the LS-DYNA solver.
        EDWRITE is only valid if explicit dynamic elements have been specified.
        This command is not necessary if the LS-DYNA solver is invoked from
        within ANSYS, in which case Jobname.K (or Jobname.R) is written
        automatically when the solution is initiated. (If LS-DYNA is invoked
        from within ANSYS, use EDOPT to specify desired output.)

        If the analysis is a small restart (EDSTART,2), the file that is
        written will have the name Jobname.R (by default) and will only contain
        changes from the original analysis.

        If the analysis is a full restart (EDSTART,3), the file that is written
        will have the name Jobname_nn.K (by default) and will contain all the
        information from the database. In a full restart, the jobname is
        changed to Jobname_nn (nn = 01 initially, and is incremented for each
        subsequent full restart.)

        A command is included in the LS-DYNA input file to instruct the LS-DYNA
        solver to write the results files indicated by Option.  By default, LS-
        DYNA will write the ANSYS results file Jobname.RST (see the EDRST
        command).  If Jobname.HIS is desired, you must also issue EDHIST.

        Option = LSDYNA or BOTH will cause LS-DYNA to write results files for
        the LS-POST postprocessor. The D3PLOT file is always written for these
        two options. If other LS-POST files are desired, you must issue the
        appropriate EDHIST and EDOUT commands.

        Writes a matrix or vector to a specified file in a formatted sequence.
        You can also use the *VWRITE command to write data to a specified file.
        Both commands contain format descriptors on the line immediately
        following the command. The format descriptors can be in either Fortran
        or C format.

        Fortran format descriptors are enclosed in parentheses. They must
        immediately follow the *MWRITE command on a separate line of the same
        input file. The word FORMAT should not be included. The format must
        specify the number of fields to be written per line, the field width,
        the placement of the decimal point, etc. There should be one field
        descriptor for each data item written. The write operation uses the
        available system FORTRAN FORMAT conventions (see your system FORTRAN
        manual). Any standard FORTRAN real format (such as (4F6.0),
        (E10.3,2X,D8.2), etc.) and character format (A) may be used.  Integer
        (I) and list-directed (*) descriptors may not be used. Text may be
        included in the format as a quoted string. The FORTRAN descriptor must
        be enclosed in parentheses and the format must not exceed 80 characters
        (including parentheses).

        The “C” format descriptors are used if the first character of the
        format descriptor line is not a left parenthesis. “C” format
        descriptors may be up to 80 characters long, consisting of text strings
        and predefined "data descriptors" between the strings where numeric or
        alphanumeric character data are to be inserted. The normal descriptors
        are %I for integer data, %G for double precision data, %C for
        alphanumeric character data, and %/ for a line break. There must be one
        data descriptor for each specified value in the order of the specified
        values. The enhanced formats described in *MSG may also be used.

        The starting array element number must be defined. Looping continues in
        the directions indicated by the Label argument. The number of loops and
        loop skipping may also be controlled with the *VLEN and *VMASK
        commands, which work in the n2 direction (by row on the output file),
        and by  the *VCOL command, which works in the n1 direction (by column
        in the output file).  The vector specifications *VABS and *VFACT apply
        to this command, while *VCUM does not apply to this command. See the
        *VOPER command for details. If you are in the GUI, the *MWRITE command

        Performs electric field solutions and calculates the self and mutual
        conductance between multiple conductors.

        Parameters
        ----------
        symfac
            Geometric symmetry factor.  Conductance values are scaled by this
            factor which represents the fraction of the total device modeled.
            Defaults to 1.

        condname
            Alphanumeric prefix identifier used in defining named conductor
            components.

        numcond
            Total number of components.  If a ground is modeled, it is to be
            included as a component.

        --
            Unused field.

        matrixname
            Array name for computed conductance matrix.  Defaults to GMATRIX.

        Notes
        -----
        To invoke the GMATRIX macro, the exterior nodes of each conductor must
        be grouped into individual components using the CM command.  Each set
        of  independent components is assigned a component name with a common
        prefix followed by the conductor number.  A conductor system with a
        ground must also include the ground nodes as a component.  The ground
        component is numbered last in the component name sequence.

        A ground conductance matrix relates current to a voltage vector.  A
        ground matrix cannot be applied to a circuit modeler.  The lumped
        conductance matrix is a combination of  lumped "arrangements" of
        voltage differences between conductors.  Use the lumped conductance
        terms in a circuit modeler to represent conductances between
        conductors.

        Enclose all name-strings in single quotes in the GMATRIX command line.

        GMATRIX works with the following elements:

        APDL Command: DELTIM

        Specifies the time step sizes to be used for the current load step.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dtime
            Time step size for this step. If automatic time stepping is used
            (AUTOTS), DTIME is the starting time substep.

        dtmin
            Minimum time step (if automatic time stepping is used). The program
            automatically determines the default based on the physics of the
            model.

        dtmax
            Maximum time step (if automatic time stepping is used). The program
            automatically determines the default based on the physics of the
            model.

        carry
            Time step carry over key:

            OFF - Use DTIME as time step at start of each load step.

            ON - Use final time step from previous load step as the starting time step (if
                 automatic time stepping is used).

        Notes
        -----
        See NSUBST for an alternative input.

        Use consistent values for DTIME and TIME (TIME). For example, using 0.9
        for DTIME and 1.0 for TIME results in one time step because 1.0 (TIME)
        is divisible by .9 (DTIME) at most once. If you intend to load in 10
        increments over a time span of 1.0, use 0.1 for DTIME and 1.0 for TIME.

        The program calculates the initial incremental time so that (EndingTime
        - StartingTime)/DTIME is an integer, which may affect the initial
        incremental time that you specify. For example, if the starting time is
        0, the ending time is 1, and the initial incremental time is 0.4, the
        program rounds to the nearest integer and adjusts the time to 0.33333.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key
            Ramping key:

            0 - Loads are linearly interpolated (ramped) for each substep from the values of
                the previous load step to the values of this load step. This is
                the default value.

            1 - Loads are step changed (stepped) at the first substep of this load step to the
                values of this load step (i.e., the same values are used for
                all substeps).  Useful for rate-dependent behavior (e.g.,
                creep, viscoplasticity, etc.) or transient load steps only.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies whether loads applied to intermediate substeps within the
        load step are to be stepped or ramped. Used only if DTIME on the DELTIM
        command is less than the time span or, conversely, if NSBSTP on the
        NSUBST command is greater than one. Flags (FSI, MXWF, MVDI, etc.) are
        always stepped.

        Changing the ramping KEY (i.e., switching between ramped and stepped
        boundary conditions) between load steps is not recommended.

        For ramped loading (KBC,0), when a load is applied for the first time,
        it is interpolated from zero to the value of the current load step, and
        not from the initial condition or value of the degree of freedom from
        the previous load step.

        Spatially varying tabular loads or boundary conditions do not support
        direct ramping or stepping options and, instead, apply their full
        values according to the supplied tabular functions regardless of the
        KBC setting.

        For a static or harmonic cyclic symmetry analysis, any load that varies
        by sector (CYCOPT,LDSECT) is tabular and is applied as a step change,
        regardless of the KBC setting; however, any non-tabular loads in the
        same analysis are ramped or stepped according to the KBC setting.

        Irrespective of the KBC setting, loads are usually step-removed. See
        Stepping or Ramping Loads in the Basic Analysis Guide for more
        information.

        It is sometimes difficult to obtain successful convergence with stepped
        loading in a nonlinear transient problem. If divergence is encountered,
        determine if stepped loading was used by default, then determine if it
        is appropriate for the analysis.

        APDL Command: NUMMRG

        Merges coincident or equivalently defined items.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label
            Items to be merged:

            NODE - Nodes

            ELEM - Elements

            KP - Keypoints (will also merge lines, areas, and volumes)

            MAT - Materials

            TYPE - Element types

            REAL - Real constants

            CP - Coupled sets

            CE - Constraint equations

            ALL - All items

        toler
            Range of coincidence.  For Label = NODE and KP, defaults to 1.0E-4
            (based on maximum Cartesian coordinate difference between nodes or
            keypoints).  For Label = MAT, REAL, and CE, defaults to 1.0E-7
            (based on difference of the values normalized by the values).  Only
            items within range are merged.  (For keypoints attached to lines,
            further restrictions apply.  See the GTOLER field and Merging Solid
            Model Entities below.)

        gtoler
            Global solid model tolerance -- used only when merging keypoints
            attached to lines.  If specified, GTOLER will override the internal
            relative solid model tolerance.  See Merging Solid Model Entities
            below.

        action
            Specifies whether to merge or select coincident items.

            SELE - Select coincident items but do not merge. Action = SELE is only valid for Label
                   = NODE.

            (Blank) - Merge the coincident items (default).

        switch
            Specifies whether the lowest or highest numbered coincident item is
            retained after the merging operation.  This option does not apply
            to keypoints; i.e., for Label = KP, the lowest numbered keypoint is
            retained regardless of the Switch setting.

            LOW - Retain the lowest numbered coincident item after the merging operation
                  (default).

            HIGH - Retain the highest numbered coincident item after the merging operation.

        Notes
        -----
        After issuing the command, the area and volume sizes (ASUM and VSUM)
        may give slightly different results. In order to obtain the same
        results as before, use /FACET, /NORMAL, and ASUM / VSUM.

        The merge operation is useful for tying separate, but coincident, parts
        of a model together. If not all items are to be checked for merging,
        use the select commands (NSEL, ESEL, etc.) to select items.  Only
        selected items are included in the merge operation for nodes,
        keypoints, and elements.

        By default, the merge operation retains the lowest numbered coincident
        item.  Higher numbered coincident items are deleted.  Set Switch to
        HIGH to retain the highest numbered coincident item after the merging
        operation.  Applicable related items are also checked for deleted item
        numbers and if found, are replaced with the retained item number.  For
        example, if nodes are merged, element connectivities (except
        superelements), mesh item range associativity, coupled degrees of
        freedom, constraint equations, master degrees of freedom, gap
        conditions, degree of freedom constraints, nodal force loads, nodal
        surface loads, and nodal body force loads are checked.  Merging
        material numbers [NUMMRG,ALL or NUMMRG,MAT] does not update the
        material number referenced:

        By temperature-dependent film coefficients as part of convection load
        or a temperature-dependent emissivity as part of a surface-to-surface
        radiation load [SF, SFE, SFL, SFA]

        By real constants for multi-material elements (such as SOLID65)

        If a unique load is defined among merged nodes, the value is kept and
        applied to the retained node.  If loads are not unique (not
        recommended), only the value on the lowest node (or highest if Switch =
        HIGH) will be kept, except for "force" loads for which the values will
        be summed if they are not defined using tabular boundary conditions.

        Note:: : The unused nodes (not recommended) in elements, couplings,
        constraint equations, etc. may become active after the merge operation.

        The Action field provides the option of visualizing the coincident
        items before the merging operation.

        Caution:: : When merging entities in a model that has already been
        meshed, the order in which you issue multiple NUMMRG commands is
        significant.  If you want to merge two adjacent meshed regions that
        have coincident nodes and keypoints, always merge nodes [NUMMRG,NODE]
        before merging keypoints [NUMMRG,KP].  Merging keypoints before nodes
        can result in some of the nodes becoming "orphaned"; that is, the nodes
        lose their association with the solid model.  Orphaned nodes can cause
        certain operations (such as boundary condition transfers, surface load
        transfers, and so on) to fail. However, using NUMMRG should be avoided
        if at all possible, as the procedure outlined above may even cause
        meshing failure, especially after multiple merging and meshing
        operations.

        After a NUMMRG,NODE, is issued, some nodes may be attached to more than
        one solid entity. As a result, subsequent attempts to transfer solid
        model loads to the elements may not be successful. Issue NUMMRG,KP to
        correct this problem. Do NOT issue VCLEAR before issuing NUMMRG,KP.

        For NUMMRG,ELEM, elements must be identical in all aspects, including
        the direction of the element coordinate system.

        For certain solid and shell elements (181, 185, 190, etc) ANSYS will
        interpret coincident faces as internal and eliminate them. To prevent
        this from occurring, shrink the entities by a very small factor to
        delineate coincident items (/SHRINK, 0.0001) and no internal nodes,
        lines, areas or elements will be eliminated.

        When working with solid models, you may have better success with the
        gluing operations (AGLUE, LGLUE, VGLUE). Please read the following
        information when attempting to merge solid model entities.

        Gluing Operations vs. Merging Operations

        Adjacent, touching regions can be joined by gluing them (AGLUE, LGLUE,
        VGLUE) or by merging coincident keypoints (NUMMRG,KP, which also causes
        merging of identical lines, areas, and volumes).  In many situations,
        either approach will work just fine. Some factors, however, may lead to
        a preference for one method over the other.

        Geometric Configuration

        Gluing is possible regardless of the initial alignment or offset of the
        input entities. Keypoint merging is  possible only if each keypoint on
        one side of the face to be joined is matched by a coincident keypoint
        on the other side. This is commonly the case after a symmetry
        reflection (ARSYM or VSYMM) or a copy (AGEN or VGEN),  especially for a
        model built entirely in ANSYS rather than imported from a CAD system.
        When the geometry is  extremely precise, and the configuration is
        correct for  keypoint merging, NUMMRG is more efficient and robust than
        AGLUE or VGLUE.

        Model Accuracy

        Gluing, like all ANSYS boolean operations, requires that the input
        entities meet the current boolean tolerance  (BTOL). Otherwise, AGLUE
        or VGLUE may fail. In such cases,  relaxing the tolerance may allow

        inumb

        The ANSYS Multi-field solver solver does not allow you to switch the

        Parameters

        na
            Area (or areas, if picking is used) to be subtracted from.  If NA =

        sepo
            Behavior of the created boundary.

            (blank) - The resulting areas will share line(s) where they touch.

            SEPO - The resulting areas will have separate, but coincident line(s).

        keep
            Specifies whether NA areas are to be deleted.

            (blank) - Use the setting of KEEP on the BOPTN command.

            DELETE - Delete NA areas after ASBW operation (override BOPTN command settings).

            KEEP - Keep NA areas after ASBW operation (override BOPTN command settings).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates new areas by subtracting the intersection of the working
        plane from the NA areas.  The intersection will be a line(s).  The
        working plane must not be in the same plane as the NA areas(s).  If
        SEPO is blank, the NA area is divided at the line and the resulting
        areas will be connected, sharing a common line where they touch.  If
        SEPO is set to SEPO, NA is divided into two unconnected areas with
        separate lines.  The SEPO option may cause unintended consequences if
        any keypoints exist along the cut plane. See Solid Modeling in the
        Modeling and Meshing Guide for an illustration.  See the BOPTN command
        for an explanation of the options available to Boolean operations.
        Element attributes and solid model boundary conditions assigned to the
        original entities will not be transferred to the new entities
        generated.

        Issuing the ASBW command under certain conditions may generate a

            Storage key:

            SINGL - Store subsequent display in a single segment (overwrites last storage).

            MULTI - Store subsequent displays in unique segments [ANIM].

            DELET - Delete all currently stored segments.

            OFF - Stop storing display data in segments.

            STAT - Display segment status.

            PC - This option only applies to PC versions of ANSYS and only when animating via
                 the AVI movie player (i.e., /DEVICE,ANIM,2).  This command
                 appends frames to the File.AVI, so that the animation goes in
                 both directions (i.e., forward--backward--forward).  You must
                 have a current animation file to use this option.

        aviname
            Name of the animation file that will be created when each frame is
            saved. The .AVI extension is applied automatically. Defaults to
            Jobname.AVI if no filename is specified.

        delay
            Delay factor between each frame, in seconds. Defaults to 0.015

        Notes
        -----
        Allows graphics data to be stored in the terminal local memory (device-

             0  -  Print all nodal loads.

            > 0  - Absolute tolerance about zero within which loads are not printed.

        item

        Parameters
        ----------
        rlab
            Result set label. Identifies the result set to be used for
            postprocessing. A result set label can be the solution set label
            you defined in a PDEXE command (if you are directly postprocessing
            Monte Carlo Simulation results), or the response surface set label
            defined in an RSFIT command (for Response Surface Analyses).

        name
            Parameter name. The parameter must have been previously defined as
            a random input variable or a random output parameter with the PDVAR
            command.

        prob
            Target probability for which the random parameter value should be
            determined.

        --
            Unused field.

        conf
            Confidence level. The confidence level is used to print the
            confidence bounds on the random parameter value. The value for the
            confidence level must be between 0.0 and 1.0 and it defaults to
            0.95 (95%). Printing of confidence bound is suppressed for CONF
            0.5. This parameter is ignored for response surface methods results
            postprocessing.

        Notes
        -----
        Prints the value for the random parameter Name at which the probability
        that there are simulation values lower than that value is equal to
        PROB. This corresponds to an inversion of the cumulative distribution
        function (see PDCDF command) at a given probability. In this sense the
        PDPINV is doing the opposite of the PDPROB command. The PDPROB command
        evaluates a probability for a given random parameter value and the
        PDPINV command evaluates the random parameter value that corresponds to
        a given probability.

        If Rlab is left blank, then the result set label is inherited from the
        last PDEXE command (Slab), RSFIT command (RSlab), or the most recently
        used PDS postprocessing command where a result set label was explicitly
        specified.

        The confidence level is a probability expressing the confidence that
        the value for the requested result is in fact between the confidence
        bounds. The larger the confidence level, the wider the confidence
        bounds. Printing the confidence bounds only makes sense for
        postprocessing Monte Carlo simulation results, where the confidence
        bounds represent the accuracy of the results. With increasing sample
        sizes, the width of the confidence bounds gets smaller for the same
        confidence level. For response surface analysis methods, the number of
        simulations done on the response surface is usually very large;
        therefore, the accuracy of the results is determined by the response
        surface fit and not by the confidence level.

        The PDPINV command cannot be used to postprocess the results in a
        solution set that is based on Response Surface Methods, only Monte
        Carlo Simulations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        keep
            Specifies whether to keep the area elements after the tetrahedral
            meshing operation is complete.

            0 - Delete area elements (default).

            1 - Keep area elements.

        Notes
        -----
        The FVMESH command generates a tetrahedral volume mesh from a selected
        set of detached exterior area elements (facets).  (Detached elements
        have no solid model associativity.)  The area elements can be
        triangular-shaped, quadrilateral-shaped, or a mixture of the two.

        The FVMESH command is in contrast to the VMESH command, which requires
        a volume to be input.

        The main tetrahedra mesher [MOPT,VMESH,MAIN] is the only tetrahedra
        mesher that supports the FVMESH command.  The alternate tetrahedra
        mesher [MOPT,VMESH,ALTERNATE] does not support FVMESH. MESH200 elements
        do not support FVMESH.

        Tetrahedral mesh expansion [MOPT,TETEXPND,Value] is supported for both
        the FVMESH and VMESH commands.  Tet-mesh expansion is the only mesh
        control supported by FVMESH.

        Triangle- or quadrilateral-shaped elements may be used as input to the
        FVMESH command. Where quadrilaterals are used, the default behavior is
        for the pyramid-shaped elements to be formed at the boundary when the
        appropriate element type is specified. See the MOPT,PYRA command for
        details.

        The FVMESH command does not support multiple "volumes."  If you have
        multiple volumes in your model, select the surface elements for one
        "volume," while making sure that the surface elements for the other
        volumes are deselected.  Then use FVMESH to generate a mesh for the
        first volume.  Continue this procedure by selecting one volume at a
        time and meshing it, until all of the volumes in the model have been
        meshed.

        If an error occurs during the meshing operation, the area elements are
        kept even if KEEP = 0.

        Notes
        -----
        Concatenates multiple, adjacent areas (the input areas) into one area
        (the output area) in preparation for mapped meshing.  A volume that
        contains too many areas for mapped meshing can still be mapped meshed
        if some of the areas in that volume are first concatenated (see Meshing
        Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for details on
        mapped meshing restrictions).

        Because of modeling restrictions that result from its use, ACCAT is
        meant to be used solely for meshing.  Specifically, (a) the output area
        and any volumes that have the output area on their area list [VLIST]
        cannot be used as input to any other solid modeling operation (not even
        another ACCAT command); and (b) the output area cannot accept solid
        model boundary conditions [DA, SFA].

        The output area (or volumes which contain it) will be meshed [AMESH,
        VMESH] by meshing the input areas, which themselves must be meshable.
        The output area from the ACCAT operation will be coincident with the
        input areas and the input areas will be retained.  Consider the AADD
        command instead of ACCAT if you wish to delete the input areas.  When
        an ACCAT command is issued, volume area lists [VLIST] that contain all
        of the input areas will be updated so that the volume area lists refer
        to the output area instead of the input area.  Deletion of the output
        area [ADELE] effectively reverses the ACCAT operation and restores
        volume area lists to their original condition.  ACCAT operations on
        pairs of adjacent four-sided areas automatically concatenate
        appropriate lines [LCCAT]; in all other situations, line concatenations
        must be addressed by the user.

        You can use the ASEL command to select areas that were created by
        concatenation, and then follow it with an ADELE,ALL command to delete
        them.  See Meshing Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide

            zero or blank for either RAD1 or RAD2 defines a solid sphere.

        theta1, theta2
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the sphere.  Used for
            creating a spherical sector.  The sector begins at the
            algebraically smaller angle, extends in a positive angular
            direction, and ends at the larger angle.  The starting angle
            defaults to 0.0° and the ending angle defaults to 360.0°.  See the
            Modeling and Meshing Guide for an illustration.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines either a solid or hollow sphere or spherical sector centered
        about the working plane origin.  The sphere must have a spatial volume
        greater than zero. (i.e., this volume primitive command cannot be used
        to create a degenerate volume as a means of creating an area.)
        Inaccuracies can develop when the size of the object you create is much
        smaller than the relative coordinate system values (ratios near to or
        greater than 1000). If you require an exceptionally small sphere,
        create a larger object, and scale it down to the appropriate size.

        For a solid sphere of 360°, you define it with two areas, each
        consisting of a hemisphere.  See the SPH4 and SPH5 commands for the
        other ways to create spheres.

        ----------
        lab
            Type of force to be associated with the force items:

            TOTAL - Total forces (static, damping, and inertia).

            STATIC - Static forces.

            DAMP - Damping forces.

            INERT - Inertia forces.

        Notes
        -----
        FORCE selects the element nodal force type for output with the POST1
        PRESOL, PLESOL, PRRFOR, NFORCE, FSUM, etc. commands, the POST26 ESOL
        command, and reaction force plotting [/PBC].  For example, FORCE,STATIC
        causes item F of the PRESOL command to be the static forces for the
        elements processed. Element member forces (such as those available for
        beams and shells and processed by Item and Sequence number) are not
        affected by this command. The SMISC records extract the static force.

        The PRRSOL command is not valid with FORCE.  Use the PRRFOR command,
        which provides the same functionality as PRRSOL, instead.

        Use the FORCE command prior to any load case operations (LCOPER) to
        insure the correct element nodal force combinations.

        In POST26, the ESOL data stored is based on the active FORCE
        specification at the time the data is stored. To store data at various
        specifications (for example, static and inertia forces), issue a STORE
        command before each new specification.

        The FORCE command cannot be used to extract static, damping, and
        inertial forces for MPC184 joint elements.

        To retrieve the different force types, use the *GET command with
        Entity=ELEM and Item1=EFOR.

        The FORCE command is not supported in a spectrum analysis. You can

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Valid convergence labels. If STAT, list the status of the currently
            specified criteria.

        value
            Typical reference value for the specified convergence label (Lab).

        toler
            Tolerance; defaults to 0.005 (0.5%) for force and moment, 1.0E-4
            (0.01%) for DVOL, 0.05 (5%) for displacement when rotational DOFs
            are not present, and 0.05 (5%) for HDSP.

            Specifies norm selection:

            2 - L2 norm (check SRSS value). Default, except for Lab = U.

            1 - L1 norm (check absolute value sum).

            0 - Infinite norm (check each DOF separately). Default for Lab = U.

        minref
            The minimum value allowed for the program calculated reference
            value. If negative, no minimum is enforced. Used only if VALUE is
            blank. Defaults to 0.01 for force, moment, and volume convergence,
            1.0E-6 for heat flow, 1.0E-12 for VLTG and CHRG, 1.0E-6 for HDSP,
            and 0.0 otherwise.

        Notes
        -----
        This command is usually not needed because the default convergence
        criteria are sufficient for most nonlinear analyses. In rare cases, you
        may need to use this command to diagnose convergence difficulties.

        Values may be set for the degrees of freedom (DOF) and/or the out-of-
        balance load for the corresponding forcing quantities.

        Issuing CNVTOL to set a convergence criterion for a specific
        convergence label (Lab) does not affect the convergence criterion for
        any other label. All other convergence criteria will remain at their
        default setting or at the value set by a previous CNVTOL command.

         When the GUI is on, if a "Delete" operation in a Nonlinear Convergence
        Criteria dialog box writes this command to a log file (Jobname.LOG or
        Jobname.LGW), you will observe that Lab is blank, VALUE = -1, and TOLER
        is an integer number.  In this case, the GUI has assigned a value of
        TOLER that corresponds to the location of a chosen convergence label in
        the dialog box's list.  It is not intended that you type in such a
        location value for TOLER in an ANSYS session.  However, a file that
        contains a GUI-generated CNVTOL command of this form can be used for
        batch input or with the /INPUT command.

        Convergence norms specified with CNVTOL may be graphically tracked
        while the solution is in process using the ANSYS program's Graphical
        Solution Tracking (GST) feature.  Use the /GST command to turn GST on
        or off.  By default, GST is ON for interactive sessions and OFF for

        Notes
        -----

        Here are excerpts from a sample user section mesh file for a section
        with 75 nodes, 13 cells, and 9 nodes per cell for a two-hole box
        section. Illustrations of the two-hole box section and the cell mesh
        for it appear later in this command description.

        The mesh file is divided into three sections: the First Line, the Cells
        Section, and the Nodes Section.  Here are brief descriptions of the
        contents of each.

        First Line:  The First Line defines the number of nodes and the number
        of cells for the mesh.

        Cells Section:  The Cells Section contains as many lines as there are
        cells.  In this example, there are thirteen cells, so there are
        thirteen lines in this section. In each line, the number “1” that
        follows the cell connectivity information is the material number.

        Cell nodal connectivity must be given in a counterclockwise direction,
        with the center node being the ninth node. For details, see Figure:
        10:: Cell Mesh for the Two-hole Box Section.

        Nodes Section:  The Nodes Section contains as many lines as there are
        nodes.  In this example, there are 75 nodes, so there are a total of 75
        lines in this section.  Each node line contains the node's boundary
        flag, the Y coordinate of the node, and the Z coordinate of the node.
        Currently, all node boundary flags appear as 0s in a cell mesh file (as
        illustrated in Figure: 9:: Two-hole Box Section). Since all node
        boundary flags are 0, SECREAD ignores them when it reads a cell mesh
        file into ANSYS.

        There cannot be any gaps in the node numbering of a cell mesh.  The
        nodes in a cell mesh must be numbered consecutively, with the first
        node having a node number of 1, and the last node having a node number
        that is equal to the maximum number of nodes in the cell mesh.

            Scale factor for displacements being added to nodal coordinates.
            If FACTOR = 1.0, the full displacement value will be added to each
            node, 0.5, half the displacement value will be added, etc.  If

            each node, etc.

        key
            Key for zeroing displacements in the database:

            OFF - Do not zero the displacements (default).

            ON - Zero the displacements.

        Notes
        -----
        The UPCOORD command uses displacements stored in the ANSYS database,
        and not those contained within the results file, Jobname.RST.  Nodal
        coordinates are updated each time the command is issued.  After
        updating, both the nodal displacements and rotations are set to zero if
        Key = ON.

        For structural solutions with an updated mesh, unless the coefficient
        matrix is otherwise reformed (e.g., a new analysis or NLGEOM,ON) it
        should first be reformed by issuing a KUSE,-1 command.

        UPCOORD should not be issued between load steps in structural analysis.

        For a multiphysics simulation where a CFD or electromagnetic field is
        being coupled to a structure undergoing large displacements, all (or a
        portion) of the surrounding field mesh may take part in the structural
        solution to "move" with the displacing structure.  You can use the
        UPCOORD command with a suitable FACTOR to update the coordinates of the
        nodes using the newly computed displacements.  The mesh will now
        conform with the displaced structure for subsequent field solutions.
        However, the mesh should always be restored to its original location by
        using an UPCOORD,FACTOR command before performing any subsequent
        structural solutions.  This is true for both repeated linear solutions,
        and for nonlinear restarts. (All saved displacements are relative to
        the original mesh location.)

        This command is not intended to replace either the large displacement
        or birth and death logic.

        APDL Command: /GRAPHICS

        Defines the type of graphics display.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key
            Graphics key:

            FULL - Display all model geometry and results.

            POWER - Activate PowerGraphics (default when GUI is on).

        Notes
        -----
        The /GRAPHICS command specifies the type of graphics display. Key =
        POWER activates the PowerGraphics capability. PowerGraphics offers
        faster plotting than the Key = FULL option, and speeds up element,
        results, area, line, and volume displays. PowerGraphics mode (the
        default) is automatically invoked when the GUI is accessed. This action
        supersedes all prior macros or start up routines (start.ans,
        config.ans, etc.). Full graphics mode can be accessed only by issuing
        /GRAPHICS, FULL after the GUI is active.

        Results values (both printed and plotted) may differ between the Key =
        FULL and Key = POWER options because each option specifies a different
        set of data for averaging and display. For Key = FULL, all element and
        results values (interior and surface) are included.  For Key = POWER,
        only element and results values along the model exterior surface are
        processed.

        Caution:: : If you have specified one facet per element edge for
        PowerGraphics displays (via the /EFACET command or via choices from the
        General Postproc or Utility Menus), PowerGraphics does not plot midside
        nodes.

        The /EFACET command is only applicable to element type displays. (See
        the descriptions of these commands for more information.)

        Maximum values shown in plots can differ from printed maximum values.
        This is due to different averaging schemes used for plotted and printed
        maximum values.

        PowerGraphics displays do not average at geometric discontinuities. The
        printouts in PowerGraphics will, however, provide averaging information
        at geometric discontinuities if the models do not contain shell
        elements. Carefully inspect the data you obtain at geometric
        discontinuities.

        PowerGraphics does not support the following diffusion analysis
        results: CONC, CG, DF, EPDI.

        Note:: : In Full Graphics mode, it is possible to deselect an
        individual node, select all elements (including the element that
        contains that node), and then perform postprocessing calculations on
        those elements and have that unselected node not be considered in those
        calculations.  However, if PowerGraphics is active, postprocessing
        always displays based on selected elements.

        PowerGraphics does not support membrane shell elements such as SHELL41,
        and these elements using the membrane-stiffness-only option (KEYOPT1) =
        1): SHELL181, SHELL208, and SHELL209.

        Commands that are not supported by PowerGraphics are listed below.
        These commands are executed using the Key = FULL option, regardless of
        whether PowerGraphics is activated.  Only certain options for /CTYPE,
        /EDGE, /ESHAPE, *GET, /PNUM, /PSYMB, SHELL, and *VGET are not supported
        by PowerGraphics.  (See the descriptions of these commands for more
        information.)

        The MSOLVE command starts multiple solutions (load steps) for random

        The program checks the norm convergence by comparing two averaged sets
        of radiated sound powers with the interval NRMCHKINC over the frequency
        range. For example, if NRMCHKINC = 5, the averaged values from 5
        solutions are compared with the averaged values from 10 solutions, then
        the averaged values from 10 solutions are compared with the averaged
        values from 15 solutions, and so on.

        autocont
            A value of 1 enables automatic scaling of contour values based on

        Notes
        -----
        This command causes coded files of solid model (in IGES format) and

        normally written by the CDWRITE or IGESOUT command.  Note that the
        active coordinate system in these files has been reset to Cartesian
        (CSYS,0).

        If a set of data exists prior to the CDREAD operation, that data set is
        offset upward to allow the new data to fit without overlap. The
        NOOFFSET command allows this offset to be ignored on a set-by-set
        basis, causing the existing data set to be overwritten with the new
        data set.

        When you write the geometry data using the CDWRITE,GEOM option, you use
        the CDREAD,DB option to read the geometry information.

        Using the CDREAD,COMB option will not write NUMOFF commands to offset
        entity ID numbers if there is no solid model in the database.

                     repeatedly, the part list is overwritten, except for PART
                     IDs created with the ADD option. Remaining fields are
                     ignored for this option.

            UPDATE - Updates the PART IDs for the element groups without changing the order of the
                     existing part list. If elements are redefined (or new
                     elements are created) with different MAT, TYPE, or REAL
                     set numbers, then use this option to create an updated
                     list of PART IDs. Remaining fields are ignored for this
                     option.

            ADD - Assigns a user-specified PART ID (PARTID) to the elements contained in the
                  element component Cname, or to the currently selected set of
                  elements if Cname = ALL. Use this option to assign a specific
                  PART ID to an element group that has the same combination of
                  MAT, TYPE, and REAL set numbers. An UPDATE operation is
                  automatically performed on the currently selected set of
                  elements immediately following the ADD operation.

            DELE - Deletes a PART ID assigned by the ADD option. PARTID is also required. An
                   UPDATE operation is automatically performed on the currently
                   selected set of elements immediately following the DELE
                   operation.

            LIST - Lists the PART IDs for the element groups. The part list consists of five
                   columns of numbers, one each for PART, MAT, TYPE, and REAL
                   numbers, and one to indicate if the PART ID is used
                   (including how many elements use it). The part list is based
                   on the last CREATE or UPDATE operation. Remaining fields are
                   ignored for this option.

        partid
            A positive integer to be used as PART ID for the elements specified
            by Cname (no default). The number input must not be currently used
            for an existing part (except when Option = DELE). Any previously
            defined PART IDs for the elements, whether assigned by the user or
            created by ANSYS LS-DYNA, will be overwritten. The user-specified
            PART ID will not be changed by subsequent EDPART,CREATE or
            EDPART,UPDATE commands.

        cname
            Element component name for user-specified PART ID definition
            (Option = ADD). If Cname = ALL (default), all currently selected
            elements are considered for the part. The elements in the element
            component (or the currently selected set of elements if Cname = ALL
            or blank) must have the same combination of MAT, TYPE, and REAL set
            numbers, or the ADD option will be ignored.

        Notes
        -----
        Certain ANSYS LS-DYNA commands (such as EDCGEN, EDLOAD, EDREAD, etc.)
        refer to PART IDs. You must define PART IDs (EDPART,CREATE or
        EDPART,ADD) before using these commands.

        If parts are repeatedly created using Option = CREATE, the part list is
        continuously overwritten. This may cause problems for previously
        defined commands that reference a part number that has changed. To
        avoid this problem, the part list should be updated (Option = UPDATE)
        rather than recreated to obtain the current part list.

        EDPART,ADD allows you to assign a specific part number to a group of
        elements instead of a number generated by the ANSYS LS-DYNA program.
        The user-specified PART IDs will not be changed by subsequent
        EDPART,CREATE or EDPART,UPDATE commands. Thus, you can use EDPART,ADD
        to specify PART IDs for some element groups, and use EDPART,CREATE or
        EDPART,UPDATE to assign PART IDs for the remaining element groups. Use
        EDPART,DELE to delete a PART ID generated by the ADD option. In this
        case, ANSYS LS-DYNA will generate a new PART ID for those elements
        associated with the deleted PART ID.

        After creating or updating the part list, use EDPART,LIST to list the
        PART IDs and choose the correct one for use with other ANSYS LS-DYNA
        commands. For a detailed discussion on PART IDs, see The Definition of
        Part in the ANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide.

        This command is also valid in SOLUTION.

        Creates contact elements for general contact.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Option to be performed.

            NEW - Create a new general contact definition. This option removes all existing
                  general contact elements and generates new elements with new
                  section IDs. Any existing GCDEF specifications, general
                  contact SECTYPE/SECDATA data, and general contact element
                  types are also removed. If no general contact elements or
                  data exist, this option behaves the same as Option = UPDATE.

            UPDATE - Generate general contact elements on newly added (or selected) base elements.
                     Newly generated contact elements are assigned new Section
                     IDs. Existing general contact elements remain with their
                     previously assigned section IDs and element attributes.
                     Existing GCDEF and SECTYPE/SECDATA general contact data
                     are respected. (This is the default option.)

            DELETE - Remove all existing general contact elements. Existing GCDEF specifications,
                     general contact SECTYPE/SECDATA data, and general contact
                     element types are also removed.

            SELECT - Select all existing general contact elements.

        featureangle
            Angle tolerance for determining feature edges (EdgeKEY) and general
            surfaces (SplitKey). Default = 42 degrees.

        edgekey
            Key that controls creation of general contact line elements
            (CONTA177) on base shell element perimeter edges and/or base solid
            element feature edges. See Understanding FeatureANGLE for an
            explanation of the feature edge criteria.

            0 - Exclude feature edges and shell perimeter edges (default).

            1 - Include feature edges only.

            2 - Include shell perimeter edges only.

            3 - Include both feature edges and shell perimeter edges.

        splitkey
            Key that controls how section IDs and contact element type IDs are
            assigned to surfaces.

            SPLIT - Assign a different section ID and contact element type ID for every general
                    surface of the selected base elements (default). See
                    Understanding FeatureANGLE for an explanation of the split
                    criteria. Different section IDs are assigned to top and
                    bottom surfaces of 2-D beam and 3-D shell bodies. This
                    allows different GCDEF specifications for different
                    portions of the assembly.

            PART - Assign a different section ID and contact element type ID for every general
                   surface which covers a physical part. Compared to the SPLIT
                   option, this option produces fewer unique section IDs, which
                   can make it easier to specify interactions via GCDEF.
                   However, it may also result in a less accurate and/or less
                   efficient solution.

        selopt
            Key that controls which base elements are considered for general
            contact.

            ATTACH - Use a recursive adjacency selection to obtain complete physical parts, starting
                     from the selected base elements, before generating general
                     contact elements (default).

            SELECT - Use only the initially selected base elements to generate general contact
                     elements.

        Notes
        -----
        GCGEN creates general contact elements on the exterior faces of
        selected base elements. The base elements can be 2-D or 3-D solids, 2-D
        beams (top and bottom), or 3-D shells (top and bottom). The contact
        element types can be CONTA172, CONTA174, and/or CONTA177, depending
        upon the types of base elements in the model and the specified GCGEN
        options. General contact elements are identified by a real constant ID
        equal to zero.

        You can control contact interactions between specific general contact
        surfaces that could potentially be in contact by using the GCDEF
        command. See General Contact in the Contact Technology Guide for more
        information on the overall procedure to create general contact.

        Understanding FeatureANGLE

        The exterior facets of the selected base solid and shell elements are
        divided into subsets based on the angle between the normals of
        neighboring faces. On a flat or smooth surface, adjacent exterior
        element faces have normals that are parallel or nearly parallel; that
        is, the angle between the adjacent normals is near zero degrees.

        When the angle between the normals of two adjacent faces is greater
        than FeatureANGLE, the two faces are considered to be on two separate
        surfaces (SplitKey = SPLIT). The edge between the faces may be convex
        or concave. A convex (or outside) edge is considered to be a feature
        edge and may be affected by the EdgeKEY setting. For more information,
        see Feature Angle (FeatureANGLE) in the Contact Technology Guide.

        phi

            perspective, decrease angle for less.  If the distance [/DIST] is

            the angle, the more the perspective and the less the magnification.
            Defaults to 0.0 (no perspective).

        Notes
        -----
        Perspective shows the true depth of the object in the display.  A
        variable magnification results since the back plane of the object is
        further from the observer than the front plane.  The largest
        magnification occurs at the front plane.  With perspective, the
        magnification factor (MAGF) is not only a function of the distance from
        the object, but also the window shape and the perspective (or view
        cone) angle: Φ as follows:

        where , for square windows, is the largest in-plane vertical or
        horizontal dimension, d is the distance from the observer to the plane
        of:  (usually the front plane of the object), and: Φ is the view cone
        angle (defined with the /VCONE command).  The bigger the cone angle,
        the more the perspective.  The magnification factor proportionally
        decreases with increasing: Φ.  The distance can be defined with the
        /DIST or the /FOCUS command.  Note, the distance input on the /DIST
        command is equal to d only if the focus point is located on the plane
        of : .  It is recommended that if a general perspective is desired
        (i.e., not any specific cone angle), use Φ = 45.0 (since TAN(45.0) =
        1.0) and let the d value be automatically calculated for full window
        magnification.

        Note that any number of /DIST, /FOCUS, and /VCONE combinations can be
        used to produce the same magnification.  Distances less than the object
        depth will produce views from within the object.

        A magnification factor of 1.0 just fills the window.  If the automatic
        scaling option is used [/AUTO], the magnification factor is fixed at
        0.91 (to allow a 10% margin around the object) and d is automatically
        calculated for the given /VCONE and /FOCUS values.  Any value of Φ
        between 0.0 and 85.0 (usually 45.0) may be used to activate the
        perspective.  Views from inside the object are not possible when d is
        automatically calculated (use manual scaling [/USER] along with /DIST
        specification).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        modeselmethod
            Methods for mode selection (not supported for complex
            eigensolvers):

            blank - No mode selection is performed (default).

            MODM - The mode selection is based on the modal effective masses.

            MODC - The mode selection is based on the mode coefficients.

            DDAM - The mode selection is based on DDAM procedure (see Mode Selection Based on DDAM
                   Procedure in the Mechanical APDL Structural Analysis Guide
                   for more information). This option is applicable only to
                   DDAM spectrum analysis.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the number of modes to expand and write over a frequency
        range for a modal (ANTYPE,MODAL) or buckling (ANTYPE,BUCKLE) analysis.
        If used in SOLUTION, this command is valid only within the first load
        step.

        There is no limit on the number of expanded modes (NMODE). However,
        there is a limit on the maximum number of modes used via the *GET,,MODE
        command, mode combinations, and the MDAMP command.

        With MSUPkey = YES, the computed element results (Elcalc = YES) are
        written to Jobname.MODE for use in subsequent downstream mode-
        superposition analyses, including harmonic, transient, and PSD
        analyses. This significantly reduces computation time for the
        combination or expansion passes. For limitations, see Option: Number of
        Modes to Expand (MXPAND) in the Mechanical APDL Structural Analysis
        Guide.

        If a mode selection method (ModeSelMethod) is defined, only the
        selected modes will be expanded. See Using Mode Selection in the
        Mechanical APDL Structural Analysis Guide for more details about the
        procedure.

        For array input (NMODE), the array must be dimensioned to be the size
        of the number of modes extracted (NMODE on the MODOPT command). A value
        of 1 in the array indicates the mode is to be expanded, and a value of
        0 indicates not to expand the mode. For the DAMP modal solution, the
        modes are in pairs, so be sure to verify that both modes of a pair have
        the same value. (For example, if modes #3 and #4 are a pair, indices 3
        and 4 in the array should have the same value, 0 or 1.)

        For linear perturbation modal analyses, you must set both Elcalc and
        MSUPkey to YES so that the downstream stress expansion pass can produce
        a solution consistent with the linear or nonlinear base (static or full
        transient) analysis. The prestressed nonlinear element history (saved
        variables) is accessible only in the first and second phases of the
        linear perturbation. The downstream MSUP or PSD analysis can only reuse
        the nonlinear information contained in the Jobname.MODE file that is
        generated in the linear perturbation.

        In a Distributed ANSYS analysis, you must issue MXPAND to specify the
        number of modes to expand when computing the modes and mode shapes. In
        a Distributed ANSYS run, MXPAND cannot be issued in an expansion pass
        (EXPASS).

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        matrix.  Data are read from a formatted file or, if the menu is off
        [/MENU,OFF] and Fname is blank, from the next input lines.  The format
        of the data to be read must be input immediately following the *VREAD
        command.  The format specifies the number of fields to be read per
        record, the field width, and the placement of the decimal point (if
        none specified in the value).  The read operation follows the available
        FORTRAN FORMAT conventions of the system (see your system FORTRAN
        manual).  Any standard FORTRAN real format (such as (4F6.0),
        (E10.3,2X,D8.2), etc.) or alphanumeric format (A) may be used.
        Alphanumeric strings are limited to a maximum of 8 characters for any
        field (A8). For storage of string arrays greater than 8 characters, the
        *SREAD command can be used. Integer (I) and list-directed (*)
        descriptors may not be used.  The parentheses must be included in the
        format and the format must not exceed 80 characters (including
        parentheses).  The input line length is limited to 128 characters.

        A starting array element number must be defined for the result array
        parameter vector (numeric or character).  For example, entering these
        two lines:

        will read two values from each line of file ARRAYVAL and assign the
        values to A(1), A(2), A(3), etc.  Reading continues until successive
        row elements [*VLEN, *VMASK, *DIM] are filled.

        For an array parameter matrix, a starting array element row and column
        number must be defined.  For example, entering these two lines:

        will read two values from each line of file ARRAYVAL and assign the
        values to A(1,1), A(2,1), A(3,1), etc.  Reading continues until n1 (10)
        successive row elements are filled.  Once the maximum row number is
        reached, subsequent data will be read into the next column (e.g.,
        A(1,2), A(2,2), A(3,2), etc.)

        For numerical parameters, absolute values and scale factors may be
        applied to the result parameter [*VABS, *VFACT].  Results may be
        cumulative [*VCUM].  See the *VOPER command for details.  If you are in

        You can apply only one displacement, velocity, or acceleration load at

        Parameters
        ----------
        sename
            The name (case-sensitive, thirty-two character maximum) assigned to
            the superelement matrix file. The matrix file will be named
            Sename.SUB. This field defaults to Fname on the /FILNAME command.

        sematr
            Matrix generation key:

            1 - Generate stiffness (or conductivity) matrix (default).

            2 - Generate stiffness and mass (or conductivity and specific heat) matrices.

            3 - Generate stiffness, mass and damping matrices.

        sepr
            Print key:

            0 - Do not print superelement matrices or load vectors.

            1 - Print both load vectors and superelement matrices.

            2 - Print load vectors but not matrices.

        sesst
            Stress stiffening key:

            0 - Do not save space for stress stiffening in a later run.

            1 - Save space for the stress stiffening matrix (calculated in a subsequent
                generation run after the expansion pass).

        expmth
            Expansion method for expansion pass:

            BACKSUB - Save necessary factorized matrix files for backsubstitution during subsequent
                      expansion passes (default). This normally results in a
                      large usage of disk space

            RESOLVE - Do not save factorized matrix files. Global stiffness matrix will be reformed
                      during expansion pass. This option provides an effective
                      way to save disk space usage. This option cannot be used
                      if the use pass uses large deflections (NLGEOM,ON).

        seoclvl
            For the added-mass calculation, the ocean level to use when ocean
            waves (OCTYPE,,WAVE) are present:

            ATP - The ocean level at this point in time (default).

            MSL - The mean ocean level.

        Notes
        -----
        The SEOPT command specifies substructure analysis options
        (ANTYPE,SUBSTR).  If used during solution, the command is valid only
        within the first load step.

        When ocean waves (OCTYPE,,WAVE) are present, the SeOcLvL argument
        specifies the ocean height or level to use for the added-mass
        calculation, as the use-run analysis type is unknown during the
        generation run.

        The expansion pass method RESOLVE is not supported with component mode
        synthesis analysis (CMSOPT). ExpMth is automatically set to BACKSUB for
        CMS analysis. The RESOLVE method invalidates the use of the NUMEXP
        command. The RESOLVE method does not allow the computation of results
        based on nodal velocity and nodal acceleration (damping force, inertial
        force, kinetic energy, etc.) in the substructure expansion pass.

                   point results to the nodes (default).

            YES - Extrapolate the linear portion of the integration point results to the nodes
                  and copy the nonlinear portion (for example, plastic
                  strains).

            NO - Copy the integration point results to the nodes.

        -----
        Specifies whether the solution results at the element integration
        points are extrapolated or copied to the nodes for element and nodal
        postprocessing. The structural stresses, elastic and thermal strains,
        field gradients, and fluxes are affected.  Nonlinear data (plastic,

        This command is valid in a new explicit dynamic analysis or in a

        if part switching is first activated in the original analysis. If part
        switching is not required in the original analysis but will be used in
        the restart, you must issue EDRD,D2R with no further arguments in the
        original analysis. You can use the EDRI command to define inertia
        properties for newly created rigid bodies (D2R).

        ne1, ne2, ninc
            Elements (NE1 to NE2 in increments of NINC) around which the mesh
            is to be refined. NE2 defaults to NE1, and NINC defaults to 1. If
            NE1 = ALL, NE2 and NINC are ignored and all selected elements are

            component name may also be substituted for NE1 (NE2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done. Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of number of elements outward
            from the indicated elements, NE1 to NE2 (defaults to 0).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done. Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done. Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh. (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        EREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified elements.
        By default, the surrounding elements are split to create new elements
        with 1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        EREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified elements. Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified elements, but are not tetrahedra (for
        example, hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements. This applies to
        nodes and elements anywhere in the model, not just in the region where
        you want to request mesh refinement.   If you have detached the mesh
        from the solid model, you must disable postprocessing cleanup or
        smoothing (POST = OFF) after the refinement to preserve the element
        attributes.

        For additional restrictions on mesh refinement, see Revising Your Model

        nsvar
            The number of user-defined state variables (TB,STATE) to be written

        key
            Line search key:

            OFF - Do not use a line search.

            ON - Use a line search.  Note, adaptive descent is suppressed when LNSRCH is on
                 unless explicitly requested on the NROPT command.   Having
                 line search on and adaptive descent on at the same time is not
                 recommended.

            AUTO - The program automatically switches line searching ON and OFF between substeps
                   of a load step as needed.  This option is recommended.

        Notes
        -----
        Activates a line search to be used with the Newton-Raphson method
        [NROPT].  Line search is an alternative to adaptive descent (see Line
        Search in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference).

        LNSRCH,AUTO can be very efficient for problems in which LNSRCH is
        needed at only certain substeps.

        You cannot use line search [LNSRCH], automatic time stepping [AUTOTS],
        or the DOF solution predictor [PRED] with the arc-length method
        [ARCLEN, ARCTRM]. If you activate the arc-length method after you set
        LNSRCH, AUTOTS, or PRED, a warning message appears. If you choose to
        proceed with the arc-length method, the program disables your line
        search, automatic time stepping, and DOF predictor settings, and the
        time step size is controlled by the arc-length method internally.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        name
            The file name of the NX part to be imported, which cannot exceed 64
            characters in length. The path name must begin with an alphanumeric
            character. Special characters such as &, -,  and * are not
            permitted in the part name.

        extension
            The NX part file extension. The default is .prt.

        path
            The full path name to the directory containing the part, enclosed
            in single quotes; for example, '/ug_parts'. The default is the
            current working directory.

        entity
            Entity to be imported.

            0 or Solid - Solids only, imported as ANSYS volumes (the default).

            1 or Surface - Surfaces only, imported as ANSYS areas.

            2 or Wireframe - Wireframe only, imported as ANSYS lines.

            3 or All - All entities. Use this option when the part contains entities that may not be
                       attached to each other, such as a solid in one location
                       and a surface in another.

        layer
            The number(s) assigned to the layer(s) to be imported. You can
            import one layer or a range of layers (designated by hyphens).
            Defaults to 1-256 (all layers).

        fmt
            The format in which ANSYS will store the model.

            0 - Neutral format (default). Defeaturing after import is restricted.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows repeated force load (force, heat flow, etc.) values to be
        replaced, added, or ignored.  Operations apply to the selected nodes
        [NSEL]. and the force labels corresponding to the selected force labels
        [DOFSEL].  The operations occur when the next force specifications are
        defined.  For example, issuing the command F,1,FX,250 after a previous
        F,1,FX,200 causes the current value of the force on node 1 in the
        x-direction to be 450 with the add operation, 250 with the replace
        operation, or 200 with the ignore operation.  Scale factors are also
        available to multiply the next value before the add or replace
        operation.  A scale factor of 2.0 with the previous "add" example
        results in a force of 700.  Scale factors are applied even if no
        previous values exist.  Issue FCUM,STAT to show the current label,
        operation, and scale factors.  Solid model boundary conditions are not
        affected by this command, but boundary conditions on the FE model are
        affected.

        Note:: : FE boundary conditions may still be overwritten by existing

            2 - Belytschko-Tsay warping stiffness (default).

        shpl
            Shell plasticity option. This option is only valid for these
            material models: strain rate independent plastic kinematic, strain
            rate dependent plasticity, power law plasticity, and piecewise
            linear plasticity.

            The value or table name reference for tabular boundary conditions.
            To specify a table, enclose the table name in percent (%) signs
            (DVAL,BaseID,U,%tablename%). Use the *DIM command to define a
            table.

        value2
            The value of the second degree of freedom (if present). If the
            analysis type and the degree of freedom allow a complex input,
            VALUE is the real component and VALUE2 is the imaginary component.

        keycal
            Displacement result calculation key:

            ON - Calculate absolute displacement and acceleration results (default).

            OFF - Calculate relative displacement and acceleration results.

        Notes
        -----
        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you can apply
        enforced displacement or acceleration loads. If multiple loads are
        specified for the same base identification number (BaseID), the last
        load applied overrides the previous ones. For example, the following
        commands apply displacement to the base with identification number 1:

        In this case, the acceleration (ACC) applied in the last command will
        override the displacement (U).

        Issue LSCLEAR,LSOPT to delete DVAL command options from the database.

        Parameters

        toler
            Tolerance for coincidence (based on maximum Cartesian coordinate
            difference for node locations and on angle differences for node
            orientations). Defaults to 0.0001. Only nodes within the tolerance
            are considered to be coincident.

        k
            Only used when the type of the elements to be generated is
            PRETS179. K is the pretension node that is common to the pretension
            section that is being created. If K is not specified, it will be
            created by ANSYS automatically and will have an ANSYS-assigned node
            number. If K is specified but does not already exist, it will be
            created automatically but will have the user-specified node number.
            K cannot be connected to any existing element.

        tlab
            Nodal number ordering. Allowable values are:

            LOW - The 2-node elements are generated from the lowest numbered node to the highest
                  numbered node.

            HIGH - The 2-node elements are generated from the highest numbered node to the lowest
                   numbered node.

            REVE - Reverses the orientation of the selected 2-node element.

        kcn
            In coordinate system KCN, elements are created between node 1 and
            node 2 (= node 1 + dx dy dz).

        dx, dy, dz
            Node location increments that define the node offset in the active
            coordinate system (DR, Dθ, DZ for cylindrical and DR, Dθ, DΦ for
            spherical or toroidal).

        knonrot
            When KNONROT = 0, the nodes coordinate system is not rotated. When
            KNONROT = 1, the nodes belonging to the elements created are
            rotated into coordinate system KCN (see NROTAT command
            description).

        Notes
        -----
        Defines 2-node elements (such as gap elements) between coincident or
        offset nodes (within a tolerance). May be used, for example, to "hook"
        together elements interfacing at a seam, where the seam consists of a
        series of node pairs. One element is generated for each set of two
        coincident nodes. For more than two coincident or offset nodes in a
        cluster, an element is generated from the lowest numbered node to each
        of the other nodes in the cluster. If fewer than all nodes are to be
        checked for coincidence, use the NSEL command to select the nodes.
        Element numbers are incremented by one from the highest previous
        element number. The element type must be set [ET] to a 2-node element
        before issuing this command. Use the CPINTF command to connect nodes by
        coupling instead of by elements. Use the CEINTF command to connect the
        nodes by constraint equations instead of by elements.

        For contact element CONTA178, the tolerance is based on the maximum
        Cartesian coordinate difference for node locations only. The angle
        differences for node orientations are not checked.

            fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may

        Notes
        -----
        This command is the same as the ESYM command except it allows
        explicitly assigning element numbers to the generated set (in terms of
        an increment IINC). Any existing elements already having these numbers
        will be redefined.

        The operation generates a new element by incrementing the nodes on the
        original element, and reversing and shifting the node connectivity
        pattern.  For example, for a 4-node 2-D element, the nodes in positions
        I, J, K and L of the original element are placed in positions J, I, L
        and K of the reflected element.

        Similar permutations occur for all other element types. For line
        elements, the nodes in positions I and J of the original element are
        placed in positions J and I of the reflected element. In releases prior
        to ANSYS 5.5, no node pattern reversing and shifting occurred for line
        elements generated by ENSYM. To achieve the same results as you did in
        releases prior to ANSYS 5.5, use the ENGEN command instead.

        See the ESYM command for additional information about symmetry
        elements.

        The ENSYM command also provides a convenient way to reverse shell
        element normals. If the IINC and NINC argument fields are left blank,
        the effect of the reflection is to reverse the direction of the outward
        normal of the specified elements. You cannot use the ENSYM command to
        change the normal direction of any element that has a body or surface
        load. We recommend that you apply all of your loads only after ensuring
        that the element normal directions are acceptable. Also note that real
        constants (such as nonuniform shell thickness and tapered beam
        constants) may be invalidated by an element reversal. See Revising Your
        Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for more information about

        Controls element shape checking.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Shape checking option.  (When Lab = WARN, STATUS, SUMMARY, or
            DEFAULT, the remaining arguments are ignored.)

            ON - Activates element shape checking.  New elements, regardless of how they are
                 created, are tested against existing warning and error limits.
                 (The existing limits may be the default limits, or previously
                 modified limits.)  Elements that violate error limits produce
                 error messages and either (a) cause a meshing failure, or (b)
                 for element creation or storage other than AMESH or VMESH, are
                 not stored.  Elements that violate warning limits produce
                 warning messages.  If shape checking was previously turned off
                 [SHPP,OFF] and you turn it on, existing elements are marked as
                 untested; use the CHECK command to retest them.  With this
                 option, you may also specify a value for VALUE1 to turn
                 individual shape tests on.  If you do not specify a value for
                 VALUE1, all shape tests are turned on.

            WARN - Activates element shape checking; however, in contrast to SHPP,ON, elements
                   that violate error limits do not cause either a meshing or
                   element storage failure.  Instead, they produce warning
                   messages to notify you that error limits have been violated.
                   This option does not alter current shape parameter limits.
                   Since the default shape parameter error limits are set to
                   allow almost any usable element, the elements this option
                   allows, which would otherwise be forbidden, are likely to be
                   very poorly shaped.

            OFF - Deactivates element shape checking.  This setting does not alter current shape
                  parameter limits.  Use of this option is risky, since poorly
                  shaped elements can lead to analysis results that are less
                  accurate than would otherwise be expected for a given mesh
                  density.  With this option, you may also specify a value for
                  VALUE1 to turn individual shape tests off.  If you do not
                  specify a value for VALUE1, all element shape tests are
                  turned off.

            SILENT - Determines whether element shape checking runs in silent mode.  In silent mode,
                     ANSYS checks elements without issuing warnings, with the
                     exception of the generic warnings that it issues at
                     solution.  With this option, you must also specify a value
                     for VALUE1  (During the execution of certain commands,
                     ANSYS automatically runs element shape checking in silent
                     mode, then internally summarizes the shape test results
                     for all of the new or modified elements.  ANSYS does this
                     when it executes any of the following commands:  AGEN,
                     AMESH, AREFINE, ARSYM, ATRAN, CDREAD, EGEN, ENGEN, ENSYM,
                     EREAD, EREFINE, ESYM, ET, FVMESH, KREFINE, LREFINE,
                     NREFINE, TIMP, VEXT, VGEN, VIMP, VMESH, VOFFST, VROTAT,
                     VSWEEP, VSYMM, and VTRAN.)

            STATUS - Lists the shape parameter limits currently in effect, along with status
                     information about element shape checking (for example,
                     whether any individual shape tests are off, whether any of
                     the shape parameter limits have been modified, and so on).

            SUMMARY - Lists a summary of element shape test results for all selected elements.

            DEFAULT - Resets element shape parameter limits to their default values.  Also, if any
                      individual tests were turned off, turns them back on.
                      (The SHPP,DEFAULT command may be useful if any parameter
                      limits were previously altered by using the MODIFY
                      option.)

            OBJECT - Determines whether element shape test results data is stored in memory.  When
                     this option is turned on, an "object" is created for
                     storing test results in memory.  When this option is
                     turned off, no object is created and no data is stored;
                     thus, any operation that requires shape parameters for an
                     existing element (such as use of the CHECK command) causes
                     the shape parameters to be recomputed.  (Note the
                     distinction between storing the data in memory and storing
                     it in the database; regardless of whether this option is
                     turned on or off, no element shape test results data will
                     be stored in the database.  The element shape parameter
                     object is deleted automatically before any solution.)
                     This setting is independent of shape checking status, with
                     one exception--if shape checking is turned off [SHPP,OFF],
                     the object is not created.  Keep in mind that recomputing
                     shape parameters is more computationally expensive than
                     retrieving them from the object.  With this option, you
                     must also specify a value for the VALUE1 argument; the
                     VALUE2 argument is ignored.

            LSTET - Determines, for Jacobian ratio tests, whether sampling is done at integration
                    points (DesignSpace product method), or at corner nodes.
                    When this option is turned on, sampling is done at
                    integration points, and the default limits for h-element
                    Jacobian ratios are a warning tolerance of 10 and an error
                    tolerance of 40. When this option is turned off, sampling
                    is done at corner nodes, and the corresponding default
                    limits are a warning tolerance of 30 and an error tolerance
                    of 1000. Sampling at the integration points (option on)
                    results in a lower Jacobian ratio, but that ratio is also
                    subjected to a more restrictive error limit. Some elements
                    that have passed the integration point sampling criterion,
                    have failed the corner mode sampling criterion. Because of
                    this, use integration point sampling only for simple linear
                    analyses. For other types of analyses (e.g., nonlinear,
                    electromagnetic), use sampling at corner nodes, which is
                    the more conservative approach. With this option, you must
                    also specify a value for the VALUE1 argument; the VALUE2
                    argument is ignored.

            MODIFY - Indicates that you want to respecify a shape parameter limit.  With this
                     option, you must also specify values for the VALUE1 and
                     VALUE2 arguments.

            FLAT - Determines the warning and error limits used to test elements that may exhibit
                   nonzero/nonconstant Z coordinates. With this option, you
                   must also specify values for the VALUE1 and/or VALUE2
                   arguments.

        value1
            Valid for the ON, OFF, SILENT, OBJECT, LSTET, MODIFY, and FLAT
            options only.  When Lab = ON or OFF, use VALUE1 to individually
            control (that is, turn off or turn on) specific element shape
            tests.  Thus, VALUE1 can be ANGD (SHELL28 corner angle deviation
            tests), ASPECT (aspect ratio tests), PARAL (deviation from
            parallelism of opposite edges tests), MAXANG (maximum corner angle
            tests), JACRAT (Jacobian ratio tests), WARP (warping factor tests),
            or ALL (all tests). When Lab = SILENT, VALUE1 can be ON (to turn
            silent mode on) or OFF (to turn silent mode off).  When Lab =
            OBJECT, VALUE1 can be either 1, YES, or ON to turn on storage of
            element shape test data (the default); or it can be 0, NO, or OFF
            to turn off storage of element shape test data (delete the data and
            recompute as necessary). When Lab = LSTET, VALUE1 can be either 1,
            YES, or ON to choose Jacobian sampling at integration points; or it
            can be 0, NO, or OFF to choose Jacobian sampling at nodes (the
            default). When Lab = MODIFY, VALUE1 is the numeric location (within
            the shape parameter limit array) of the shape parameter limit to be
            modified.  Locations are identified in the element shape checking
            status listing [SHPP,STATUS].  For more information, see the
            examples in the Notes section. When Lab = FLAT, VALUE1 is the
            warning limit for XY element constant Z sets performed at CHECK or

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn
            Window number whose viewing direction will be modified to be normal
            to the working plane (defaults to 1).  If WN is a negative value,
            the viewing direction will not be modified.  If fewer than three
            points are used, the viewing direction of window WN will be used
            instead to define the normal to the working plane.

        norig
            Node number defining the origin of the working plane coordinate
            system.  If NORIG = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).

        nxax
            Node number defining the x-axis orientation (defaults to the x-axis
            being parallel to the global X-axis; or if the normal to the
            working plane is parallel to the global X-axis, then defaults to
            being parallel to the global Y-axis).

        nplan
            Node number defining the working plane (the normal defaults to the
            present display view [/VIEW] of window WN).

        Notes
        -----
        Defines a working plane to assist in picking operations using three
        nodes as an alternate to the WPLANE command.  The three nodes also
        define the working plane coordinate system.  A minimum of one node (at
        the working plane origin) is required.  Immediate mode may also be
        active.  See the WPSTYL command to set the style of the working plane
        display.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        lab
            Read operation:

            ALL - Read all paths from the selected file (default).

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        This command removes all paths from virtual memory and then reads path
        data from a file written with the PASAVE command.  All paths on the

            RACT - Reactivate the specified contact definition (which was previously deactivated);
                   valid only in a small restart.

        ctype
            Contact behavior label (see EDCGEN command for valid labels).

        cont
            Component name or part number [EDPART] identifying the contact
            surface.

        targ
            Component name or part number [EDPART] identifying the target
            surface.

        Notes
        -----
        This command allows you to delete or deactivate/reactivate a particular
        contact specification that was defined by EDCGEN. The contact
        definition is identified by Ctype, Cont, and Targ (Note that Cont and
        Targ may not be required for Ctype = AG, SE, ASSC, ESS, and SS). The
        delete option (Option = DELE) permanently deletes the contact from the
        database. Any additional contact parameters defined with the EDCMORE
        command for the contact definition identified on this command will also
        be deleted or deactivated/reactivated.

        You cannot delete contact specifications in an explicit dynamic small
        restart (EDSTART,2). However, you can use Option = DACT to deactivate a
        contact definition that is not needed in the small restart. That
        contact definition may then be reactivated in a subsequent small
        restart by using Option = RACT.

        To delete or deactivate/reactivate all contact specifications for the
        entire model, use EDDC,Option,ALL.

        The EDDC command is not supported in an explicit dynamic full restart
        analysis (EDSTART,3). Thus, you cannot delete, deactivate, or
        reactivate contact specifications in a full restart that were defined
        in the previous analysis.

        This command is also valid in SOLUTION.

        symfac
            Geometric symmetry factor.  Capacitance values are scaled by this
            factor which represents the fraction of the total device modeled.
            Defaults to 1.

            Alpha-numeric prefix identifier used in defining named conductor
            components.

        numcond
            Total Number of Components.  If a ground is modeled, it is to be
            included as a component.  If a ground is not modeled, but infinite
            elements are used to model the far-field ground, a named component
            for the far-field ground is not required.

        grndkey
            Ground key:

            0 - Ground is one of the components, which is not at infinity.

            1 - Ground is at infinity (modeled by infinite elements).

        capname
            Array name for computed capacitance matrix.  Defaults to CMATRIX.

        Notes
        -----
        To invoke the CMATRIX macro, the exterior nodes of each conductor must
        be grouped into individual components using the CM command.  Each set
        of  independent components is assigned a component name with a common
        prefix followed by the conductor number.  A conductor system with a
        ground must also include the ground nodes as a component.  The ground
        component is numbered last in the component name sequence.

        A ground capacitance matrix relates charge to a voltage vector.  A
        ground matrix cannot be applied to a circuit modeler. The lumped
        capacitance matrix is a combination of  lumped "arrangements" of
        voltage differences between conductors.  Use the lumped capacitance

        Notes
        -----
        This command is only valid in an explicit dynamic small restart
        analysis (EDSTART,2). Use this command when you do a rigid/deformable
        switch (EDRD command) and you want to control constraints defined by
        other means for the deformable body (such as nodal constraints or a
        weld). For example, if a deformable body has nodal constraints defined
        and it is switched to a rigid body, the nodal constraints should be
        deleted since they are invalid for the rigid body. Later on, if you
        want to switch the rigid body to deformable again and retain the nodal
        constraints, you can use EDRC to activate the constraints previously
        defined for the deformable body. Otherwise, the nodal constraints
        remain deactivated.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        APDL Command: ACEL

        frame for the analysis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        acel_x, acel_y, acel_z
            Linear acceleration of the reference frame along global Cartesian
            X, Y, and Z axes, respectively.

        Notes
        -----
        In the absence of any other loads or supports, the acceleration of the
        structure in each of the global Cartesian (X, Y, and Z) axes would be
        equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that applied in the ACEL
        command. Thus, to simulate gravity (by using inertial effects),
        accelerate the reference frame with an ACEL command in the direction
        opposite to gravity.

        You can define the acceleration for the following analyses types:

        Static (ANTYPE,STATIC)

        Harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC), full or mode-superposition method

        Transient (ANTYPE,TRANS)

        Substructure (ANTYPE,SUBSTR).

        For all transient dynamic (ANTYPE,TRANS) analyses, accelerations are
        combined with the element mass matrices to form a body force load
        vector term. The element mass matrix may be formed from a mass input
        constant or from a nonzero density (DENS) property, depending upon the
        element type.

        For analysis type ANTYPE,HARMIC, the acceleration is assumed to be the
        real component with a zero imaginary component.

        Units of acceleration and mass must be consistent to give a product of
        force units.

        The ACEL command supports tabular boundary conditions (%TABNAME_X%,
        %TABNAME_Y%, and %TABNAME_Z%) for ACEL_X, ACEL_Y, and ACEL_Z input
        values (*DIM) as a function of both time and frequency for full

        na1, na2, ninc
            Set of areas, NA1 to NA2 in steps of NINC, that defines the pattern
            to be scaled.  NA2 defaults to NA1, NINC defaults to 1.  If NA1 =

            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates

            R θ, R Φ for spherical).  Note that the R θ and R Φ scale factors
            are interpreted as angular offsets.  For example, if CSYS = 1, RX,
            RY, RZ input of (1.5,10,3) would scale the specified keypoints 1.5
            times in the radial and 3 times in the Z direction, while adding an
            offset of 10 degrees to the keypoints.  Zero, blank, or negative
            scale factor values are assumed to be 1.0.  Zero or blank angular
            offsets have no effect.

        kinc
            Increment to be applied to keypoint numbers for generated set.  If
            zero, the lowest available keypoint numbers will be assigned
            [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            0 - Nodes and elements associated with the original areas will be generated
                (scaled) if they exist.

            1 - Nodes and elements will not be generated.

        imove
            Specifies whether areas will be moved or newly defined:

            0 - Additional areas will be generated.

            1 - Original areas will be moved to new position (KINC and NOELEM are ignored).
                Use only if the old areas are no longer needed at their

        Notes
        -----
        The CMACEL command specifies the translational acceleration of the
        element component in each of the global Cartesian (X, Y, and Z) axis
        directions.

        Components for which you want to specify acceleration loading must
        consist of elements only. The elements you use cannot be part of more
        than one component, and elements that share nodes cannot exist in
        different element components. You cannot apply the loading to an
        assembly of element components.

        To simulate gravity (by using inertial effects), accelerate the
        structure in the direction opposite to gravity. For example, apply a
        positive CMACELY to simulate gravity acting in the negative Y
        direction. Units are length/time2.

        You can define the acceleration for the following analyses types:

        Static (ANTYPE,STATIC)

        Harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC), full or mode-superposition method

        Transient (ANTYPE,TRANS), full or mode-superposition method

        Substructure (ANTYPE,SUBSTR)

        Accelerations are combined with the element mass matrices to form a
        body force load vector term. Units of acceleration and mass must be
        consistent to give a product of force units.

        In a modal harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply the load in
        the modal portion of the analysis. Mechanical APDL calculates a load
        vector and writes it to the mode shape file, which you can apply via
        the LVSCALE command.

        The CMACEL command supports tabular boundary conditions (%TABNAME_X%,

        geometry records. The current load step, substep, and time (or
        frequency) value are maintained. All data (summable and nonsummable)
        are written.

        When complex results are appended, cFlag must be set to 1 so that the
        header is consistent with the results written on the file.

        The command is primarily intended for use in a top-down substructuring
        analysis, where the full model is resumed and the results data read
        from the use pass results file (SET), and subsequently from all

        Notes
        -----
        HMAGSOLV invokes an ANSYS macro which specifies harmonic
        electromagnetic solution options and initiates the solution.  The macro
        is applicable to any ANSYS 2-D or axisymmetric linear or nonlinear
        harmonic analysis.  Results are only stored for the final converged
        solution.  (In POST1, issue *SET,LIST to identify the load step of
        solution results.)  The macro internally determines if a nonlinear
        analysis is required based on magnetic material properties defined in
        the database.

        The macro performs a two-load-step solution sequence.  The first load
        step ramps the applied loads over a prescribed number of substeps
        (NRAMP), and the second load step calculates the converged solution.
        For linear problems, only a single load step solution is performed.
        The ramped load step can be bypassed by setting NRAMP to -1.

        A 3-D harmonic electromagnetic analysis is available for linear
        solutions only and does not require this solution macro.

        The following analysis options and nonlinear options are controlled by
        this macro:  KBC, NEQIT, NSUBST, CNVTOL, OUTRES.

        Parameters
        ----------
        snap
            Snap increment for a locational pick (1E-6 minimum).  If -1, turn
            off snap capability.  For example, a picked location of 1.2456 with
            a snap of 0.1 gives 1.2, with 0.01 gives 1.25, with 0.001 gives
            1.246, and with 0.025 gives 1.250 (defaults to 0.05).

        grspac
            Graphical spacing between grid points.  For graphical
            representation only and not related to snap points  (defaults to
            0.1).

        grmin, grmax
            Defines the size of a square grid (if WPCTYP = 0) to be displayed
            over a portion of the working plane.  The opposite corners of the
            grid will be located at grid points nearest the working plane
            coordinates of (GRMIN,GRMIN) and (GRMAX,GRMAX).  If a polar system
            (WPCTYP = 1), GRMAX is the outside radius of grid and GRMIN is
            ignored.  If GRMIN = GRMAX, no grid will be displayed (defaults to
            -1.0 and 1.0 for GRMIN and GRMAX respectively).

        wptol
            The tolerance that an entity's location can deviate from the
            specified working plane, while still being considered on the plane.
            Used only for locational picking of vertices for polygons and
            prisms (defaults to 0.003).

        wpctyp
            Working plane coordinate system type:

            0 - Cartesian (default).  If working plane tracking is on [CSYS,4], the updated
                active coordinate system will also be Cartesian.

            1 - Polar.  If working plane tracking is on, the updated active coordinate system
                will be cylindrical.

            2 - Polar.  If working plane tracking is on, the updated active coordinate system
                will be spherical.

            0 - Grid and WP triad.

            1 - Grid only.

            2 - WP triad only (default).

        wpvis

            1 - Show GRTYPE entities.  Cartesian working planes will be displayed with a
                Cartesian grid, polar with a polar grid.

        snapang
            Snap angle (0--180) in degrees.  Used only if WPCTYP = 1 or 2.

        analyses, all variables are stored in two-column arrays as complex
        variables.  If the variable is not complex, then the same value is
        stored in both columns.  This command will extract the variable in the

        Defines a volume (and its corresponding lines and areas) through eight
        (or fewer) existing keypoints.  Keypoints must be input in a continuous

        cname
            The component name corresponding to the group of excited nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        In single-point response spectrum analysis (SPOPT,SPRS), the excitation
        direction without rocking (ROCK) is normalized to one so that the SEDX,
        SEDY, and SEDZ values do not scale the spectrum.  The excitation
        direction with rocking is not normalized. The SEDX, SEDY, and SEDZ
        values must be consistent with the OMX, OMY, and OMZ values on the ROCK
        command. The calculated direction then scales the spectrum. For more
        information, see Participation Factors and Mode Coefficients.

            plane or 3-D structure is assumed.  If nonzero, an axisymmetric
            structure is assumed.  Use a suitably large number (see the
            Mechanical APDL Theory Reference) or use -1 for an axisymmetric
            straight section.

        nev
            Event number to be associated with these stresses (defaults to 1).

        nlod
            Loading number to be associated with these stresses (defaults to
            1).

        kbr
            For an axisymmetric analysis (RHO ≠ 0):

            0 - Include the thickness-direction bending stresses

            1 - Ignore the thickness-direction bending stresses

            2 - Include the thickness-direction bending stress using the same formula as the Y
                (axial direction ) bending stress. Also use the same formula

        Calculates and stores the total linearized stress components at the
        ends of a section path [PATH] (as defined by the first two nodes with
        the PPATH command). The path must be entirely within the selected
        elements (that is, there must not be any element gaps along the path).
        Stresses are stored according to the fatigue event number and loading
        number specified.  Locations (one for each node) are associated with
        those previously defined for these nodes [FL] or else they are
        automatically defined.  Stresses are separated into six total
        components (SX through SXZ) and six membrane-plus-bending (SX through
        SXZ) components.  The temperature at each end point and the current
        time are also stored along with the total stress components.
        Calculations are made from the stresses currently in the database (last
        SET or LCASE command).  Stresses are stored as section coordinate
        components if axisymmetric or as global Cartesian coordinate components
        otherwise, regardless of the active results coordinate system [RSYS].
        The FSLIST command may be used to list stresses.  The FS command can be

        /EFACET is valid only when PowerGraphics is enabled [/GRAPHICS,POWER],

        (See the /GRAPHICS command and element CONTA174 in the Element
        Reference for more information.) The /EFACET command is only applicable
        to element type displays.

        /EFACET controls the fineness of the subgrid that is used for element
        plots. The element is subdivided into smaller portions called facets.
        Facets are piecewise linear surface approximations of the actual
        element face. In their most general form, facets are warped planes in
        3-D space.  A greater number of facets will result in a smoother
        representation of the element surface for element plots. /EFACET may
        affect results averaging. See Contour Displays in the Basic Analysis
        Guide for more information.

        For midside node elements, use NUM = 2; if NUM = 1, no midside node
        information is output. For non-midside node elements, NUM should be set
        to 1. See the PLNSOL and PRNSOL commands for more information.

        With PowerGraphics active (/GRAPHICS,POWER), the averaging scheme for
        surface data with interior element data included (AVRES,,FULL) and
        multiple facets per edge (/EFACET,2 or /EFACET,4) will yield differing
        minimum and maximum contour values depending on the  Z-Buffering
        options (/TYPE,,6 or /TYPE,,7).  When the Section data is not included
        in the averaging schemes (/TYPE,,7), the resulting absolute value for
        the midside node is significantly smaller.

        For cyclic symmetry mode-superposition harmonic solutions, only NUM = 1
        is supported in postprocessing.

        Caution:: : If you specify /EFACET,1, PowerGraphics does not plot

        from the Linear Perturbation step, or the current OMEGA or CGOMGA

        cylindrical axis, otherwise a positive rotation is assumed.

        When a structure is rotating and the Coriolis or gyroscopic effect is

        ----------
        vnum
            Number identifying the volume that is to be meshed by VSWEEP.  If

        srca
            Number identifying the source area.  This is the area whose mesh
            will provide the pattern for the volume elements.  (If you do not
            mesh the source area prior to volume sweeping, ANSYS meshes it
            internally when you initiate volume sweeping.)  ANSYS sweeps the
            pattern of the area elements through the volume to create the mesh
            of volume elements.  You cannot substitute a component name for
            SRCA.

        trga
            Number identifying the target area.  This is the area that is
            opposite the source area specified by SRCA.  You cannot substitute
            a component name for TRGA.

        lsmo
            Value specifying whether ANSYS should perform line smoothing during
            volume sweeping.  (The value of this argument controls line
            smoothing for the VSWEEP command only;  it has no effect on the
            setting of the MOPT command's LSMO option.)  This argument is
            optional.

            0 - Do not perform line smoothing.  This is the default.

            1 - Always perform line smoothing.  This setting is not recommended for large
                models due to speed considerations.

        Notes
        -----
        If the source mesh consists of quadrilateral elements, ANSYS fills the
        volume with hexahedral elements.  If the source mesh consists of
        triangles, ANSYS fills the volume with wedges.  If the source mesh
        consists of a combination of quadrilaterals and triangles, ANSYS fills
        the volume with a combination of hexahedral and wedge elements.

        In the past, you may have used the VROTAT, VEXT, VOFFST, and/or VDRAG
        commands to extrude a meshed area into a meshed volume.  However, those
        commands create the volume and the volume mesh simultaneously.  In
        contrast, the VSWEEP command is intended for use in an existing
        unmeshed volume.  This makes VSWEEP particularly useful when you have
        imported a solid model that was created in another program, and you
        want to mesh it in ANSYS.

        For related information, see the description of the EXTOPT command
        (although EXTOPT sets volume sweeping options, it does not affect
        element spacing). Also see the detailed discussion of volume sweeping

        Nodal coordinate systems may be automatically rotated into the active
        (global or local) coordinate system as follows:  Rotations in Cartesian
        systems will have nodal x directions rotated parallel to the Cartesian
        X direction.  Rotations in cylindrical, spherical or toroidal systems
        will have the nodal x directions rotated parallel to the R direction.
        Nodes at (or near) a zero radius location should not be rotated.  Nodal
        coordinate directions may be displayed [/PSYMB].  Nodal forces and
        constraints will also appear rotated when displayed if the nodal
        coordinate system is rotated.

        ANSYS LS-DYNA (explicit dynamics) does not support the NROTAT command.
        If you have rotated nodes in the implicit phase of an implicit-to-
        explicit sequential solution, you must rotate the nodes back to the
        global Cartesian direction before switching from implicit to explicit
        elements (ETCHG,ITE). Use the EDNROT command in the explicit run to

        APDL Command: STABILIZE

        Activates stabilization for all elements that support nonlinear
        stabilization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key
            Key for controlling nonlinear stabilization:

            OFF  -  Deactivate stabilization. This value is the default.

            CONSTANT  -  Activate stabilization. The energy-dissipation ratio or damping factor remains
                        constant during the load step.

            REDUCE  -  Activate stabilization. The energy-dissipation ratio or damping factor is
                      reduced linearly to zero at the end of the load step from
                      the specified or calculated value.

        method
            The stabilization-control method:

            ENERGY  -  Use the energy-dissipation ratio as the control. This value is the default
                      when Key ≠ OFF.

            DAMPING  -  Use the damping factor as the control.

        value
            The energy-dissipation ratio (Method = ENERGY) or damping factor
            (Method = DAMPING). This value must be greater than 0 when Method =
            ENERGY or Method = DAMPING. When Method = ENERGY, this value is
            usually a number between 0 and 1.

        substpopt
            Option for the first substep of the load step:

            NO  -  Stabilization is not activated for the first substep even when it does not
                  converge after the minimal allowed time increment is reached.
                  This value is the default when Key ≠ OFF.

            MINTIME  -  Stabilization is activated for the first substep if it still does not converge
                       after the minimal allowed time increment is reached.

            ANYTIME  -  Stabilization is activated for the first substep. Use this option if
                       stabilization was active for the previous load step via
                       Key = CONSTANT.

        forcelimit
            The stabilization force limit coefficient, such that 0 < FORCELIMIT
            < 1. The default value is 0.2. To omit a stabilization force check,
            set this value to 0.

        Notes
        -----
        Once issued, a STABILIZE command remains in effect until you reissue
        the command.

        For the energy dissipation ratio, specify VALUE = 1.0e-4 if you have no
        prior experience with the current model; if convergence problems are
        still an issue, increase the value gradually. The damping factor is
        mesh-, material-, and time-step-dependent; an initial reference value
        from the previous run (such as a run with the energy-dissipation ratio
        as input) should suggest itself.

        Exercise caution when specifying SubStpOpt = MINTIME or ANYTIME for the
        first load step; ANSYS, Inc. recommends this option only for
        experienced users. If stabilization was active for the previous load
        step via Key = CONSTANT and convergence is an issue for the first
        substep, specify SubStpOpt = ANYTIME.

        When the L2-norm of the stabilization force (CSRSS value) exceeds the
        L2-norm of the internal force multiplied by the stabilization force
        coefficient, ANSYS issues a message displaying both the stabilization
        force norm and the internal force norm. The FORCELIMIT argument allows
        you to change the default stabilization force coefficient (normally 20
        percent).

        This command stabilizes the degrees of freedom for current-technology
        elements only. Other elements can be included in the FE model, but
        their degrees of freedom are not stabilized.

        Structures in the Structural Analysis Guide. For additional tips that
        can help you to achieve a stable final model, see Simplify Your Model
        in the Structural Analysis Guide.

        APDL Command: *SET

        Assigns values to user-named parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        par
            An alphanumeric name used to identify this parameter.  Par may be
            up to 32 characters, beginning with a letter and containing only
            letters, numbers, and underscores.  Examples:  ABC   A3X   TOP_END.
            ANSYS command names, function names, label names, component and
            assembly names, etc., should not be used.  Parameter names
            beginning with an underscore (e.g.,  _LOOP) are reserved for use by
            ANSYS and should be avoided.  Parameter names ending in an
            underscore are not listed by the *STATUS command.  Array parameter
            names must be followed by a subscript, and the entire expression
            must be 32 characters or less.  Examples:  A(1,1)   NEW_VAL(3,2,5)
            RESULT(1000).  There is no character parameter substitution for the
            Par field. Table parameters that are used in command fields (where
            constant values are normally given) are limited to 32 characters.

        value
            Numerical value or alphanumeric character string (up to 32
            characters enclosed in single quotes) to be assigned to this
            parameter.  Examples:  A(1,3)=7.4 B='ABC3'.  May also be a
            parameter or a parametric expression.  Examples:  C=A(1,3)
            A(2,2)=(C+4)/2.  If blank, delete this parameter.  Example:  A=
            deletes parameter A.

        val2, val3, val4, val5, val6, val7, val8, val9, val10
            If Par is an array parameter, values VAL2 through VAL10 (up to the
            last nonblank value) are sequentially assigned to the succeeding
            array elements of the column.  Example:  *SET,A(1,4),10,11 assigns
            A(1,4)=10, A(2,4)=11.  *SET,B(2,3),'file10','file11' assigns
            B(2,3)='file10', B(3,3)='file11'.

        Notes
        -----
        Assigns values to user-named parameters that may be substituted later
        in the run.  The equivalent (and recommended) format is

        Par = VALUE,VAL2,VAL3, . . . , VAL10

        which may be used in place of  *SET,Par, : ... for convenience.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters (numeric or character) may be scalars (single valued) or
        arrays (multiple valued in one, two, or three dimensions). An unlimited
        number of parameter names may be defined in any ANSYS run. For very
        large numbers of parameters, it is most efficient to define them in
        alphabetical order.

        Parameter values may be redefined at any time.  Array parameters may
        also be assigned values within a do-loop [*DO] for convenience.
        Internally programmed do-loop commands are also available with the *VXX
        commands (*VFILL).  Parameter values (except for parameters ending in
        an underscore) may be listed with the  *STATUS command, displayed with
        the *VPLOT   command (numeric parameters only), and modified with the
        *VEDIT command (numeric parameters only).

        Older ANSYS-supplied macro files may use parameter names that do not
        begin with an underscore. Using these macros embedded in your own
        macros may cause conflicts if the same parameter names are used.

        Parameters can also be resolved in comments created by the /COM command
        (see /COM for complete documentation). A parameter can be deleted by
        redefining it with a blank  VALUE.  If the parameter is an array, the
        entire array is deleted.  Parameters may also be defined by a response
        to a query with the  *ASK command or from an "ANSYS-supplied" value
        with the *GET command.

        Array parameters must be dimensioned  [*DIM] before being assigned
        values unless they are the result of an array operation or defined
        using the implied loop convention. Scalar parameters that are not
        defined are initialized to a "near" zero value.  Numeric array
        parameters are initialized to zero when dimensioned, and character
        array parameters are initialized to blank.  An existing array parameter
        must be deleted before it can be redimensioned.  Array parameter names
        must be followed by a subscript list (enclosed in parentheses)
        identifying the element of the array.  The subscript list may have one,
        two, or three values (separated by commas).  Typical array parameter
        elements are  A(1,1), NEW_VAL(3,2,5), RESULT(1000).  Subscripts for
        defining an array element must be integers (or parameter expressions
        that evaluate to integers).  Non-integer values are rounded to the
        nearest integer value.  All array parameters are stored as 3-D arrays
        with the unspecified dimensions set to 1.  For example, the 4th array
        element of a 1-dimensional array, A(4), is stored as array element
        A(4,1,1).  Arrays are patterned after standard FORTRAN conventions.

        If the parameter name Par is input in a numeric argument of a command,
        the numeric value of the parameter (as assigned with *SET, *GET, =,
        etc.) is substituted into the command at that point.  Substitution
        occurs only if the parameter name is used between blanks, commas,
        parentheses, or arithmetic operators (or any combination) in a numeric
        argument.  Substitution can be prevented by enclosing the parameter
        name Par within single quotes ( ' ), if the parameter is alone in the
        argument; if the parameter is part of an arithmetic expression, the
        entire expression must be enclosed within single quotes to prevent
        substitution.  In either case the character string will be used instead
        of the numeric value (and the string will be taken as 0.0 if it is in a
        numeric argument).

        A forced substitution is available in the text fields of the /TITLE,
        /STITLE,  /TLABEL, /AN3D, /SYP (ARG1--ARG8), and *ABBR  commands by
        enclosing the parameter within percent (%) signs.  Also, parameter
        substitution may be forced within the file name or extension fields of
        commands having these fields by enclosing the parameter within percent
        (%) signs.  Array parameters  [*DIM] must include a subscript (within
        parentheses) to identify the array element whose value is to be
        substituted, such as A(1,3).  Out-of-range subscripts result in an
        error message.  Non-integer subscripts are allowed when identifying a
        TABLE array element for substitution.  A proportional linear
        interpolation of values among the nearest array elements is performed
        before substitution.  Interpolation is done in all three dimensions.

        Note:: : Interpolation is based upon the assigned index numbers which
        must be defined when the table is filled [*DIM].

        Most alphanumeric arguments permit the use of character parameter
        substitution.  When the parameter name Par input, the alphanumeric
        value of the parameter is substituted into the command at that point.
        Substitution can be suppressed by enclosing the parameter name within
        single quotes ( ' ).  Forced substitution is available in some fields
        by enclosing the parameter name within percent (%) signs.  Valid forced
        substitution fields include command name fields, Fname (filename) or
        Ext (extension) arguments, *ABBR command (Abbr arguments), /TITLE and
        /STITLE commands (Title argument) and /TLABEL command (Text argument).
        Character parameter substitution is also available in the  *ASK, /AN3D,
        *CFWRITE,  *IF,  *ELSEIF,   *MSG,  *SET,  *USE,  *VREAD, and  *VWRITE
        commands.   Character array parameters must include a subscript (within
        parentheses) to identify the array element whose value is to be
        substituted.

        If a parameter operation expression is input in a numeric argument, the
        numeric value of the expression is substituted into the command at that
        point.  Allowable operation expressions are of the form

        E1oE2oE3: ...oE10

        where E1, E2, etc. are expressions connected by operators (o).  The
        allowable operations (o) are

        + - * / ** < >

        For example, A+B**C/D*E is a valid operation expression.  The *
        represents multiplication and the ** represents exponentiation.

        The SECOFFSET command is divided into three types: Beams, Pipes, and

        specified by SECOFFSET is used in thermal contact analyses.  Otherwise,
        the SECOFFSET command has no effect on the solution for these elements

        Performs a coupled electrostatic-structural analysis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        electit
            Title of the electrostatics physics file as assigned by the PHYSICS
            command.

        strutit
            Title of the structural physics file as assigned by the PHYSICS
            command.

        dimn
            Model dimensionality (a default is not allowed):

            2 - 2-D model.

            3 - 3-D model.

        morphopt
            Morphing option:

            <0 - Do not perform any mesh morphing or remeshing.

            0 - Remesh the non-structural regions for each recursive loop only if mesh morphing
                fails (default).

            1 - Remesh the non-structural regions each recursive loop and bypass mesh morphing.

            2 - Perform mesh morphing only, do not remesh any non-structural regions.

        mcomp
            Component name of the region to be morphed.  For 2-D models, the
            component may be elements or areas.  For 3-D models, the component
            may be elements or volumes.  A component must be specified. You
            must enclose name-strings in single quotes in the ESSOLV command
            line.

        xcomp
            Component name of entities excluded from morphing.  In the 2-D
            case, it is the component name for the lines excluded from
            morphing.  In the 3-D case, it is component name for the areas
            excluded from morphing.  Defaults to exterior non-shared entities
            (see the DAMORPH, DVMORPH, and DEMORPH commands). You must enclose
            name-strings in single quotes in the ESSOLV command line.

        electol
            Electrostatic energy convergence tolerance.  Defaults to .005 (.5%)
            of the value computed from the previous iteration.  If less than
            zero, the convergence criteria based on electrostatics results is
            turned off.

        strutol
            Structural maximum displacement convergence tolerance.  Defaults to
            .005 (.5%) of the value computed from the previous iteration.  If
            less than zero, the convergence criteria base on structural results
            is turned off.

        mxloop
            Maximum number of allowable solution recursive loops.  A single
            pass through both an electrostatics and structural analysis
            constitutes one loop.  Defaults to 100.

        --
            Unused field.

        ruseky
            Reuse flag option:

            1 - Assumes initial run of ESSOLV using base geometry for the first electrostatics
                solution.

            >1 - Assumes ESSOLV run is a continuation of a previous ESSOLV run, whereby the
                 morphed geometry is used for the initial electrostatic
                 simulation.

        restky
            Structural restart key.

            0 - Use static solution option for structural solution.

            1 - Use static restart solution option for structural solution.

        eiscomp
            Element component name for elements containing initial stress data
            residing in file jobname.ist. The initial stress data must be
            defined prior to issuing ESSOLV (see INISTATE command).

        Notes
        -----
        ESSOLV invokes an ANSYS macro which automatically performs a coupled
        electrostatic-structural analysis.

        The macro displays periodic updates of the convergence.

        If non-structural regions are remeshed during the analysis, boundary
        conditions and loads applied to nodes and elements will be lost.
        Accordingly, it is better to assign boundary conditions and loads to
        the solid model.

        Use RUSEKY > 1 for solving multiple ESSOLV simulations for different
        excitation levels (i.e., for running a voltage sweep). Do not issue the
        SAVE command to save the database between ESSOLV calls.

        For nonlinear structural solutions, the structural restart option
        (RESTKY = 1) may improve solution time by starting from the previous
        converged structural solution.

        For solid elements, ESSOLV automatically detects the air-structure
        interface and applies a Maxwell surface flag on the electrostatic
        elements. This flag is used to initiate the transfer for forces from
        the electrostatic region to the structure. When using the ESSOLV
        command with structural shell elements (for example, SHELL181), you
        must manually apply the Maxwell surface flag on all air elements
        surrounding the shells before writing the final electrostatic physics
        file. Use the SFA command to apply the Maxwell surface flag to the
        areas representing the shell elements; doing so ensures that the air
        elements next to both sides of the shells receive the Maxwell surface
        flag.

        If lower-order structural solids or shells are used, set KEYOPT(7) = 1
        for the electrostatic element types to ensure the correct transfer of
        forces.

        Information on creating the initial stress file is documented in the
        Loading chapter in the Basic Analysis Guide.

        APDL Command: RSPLIT

        Creates one or more results file(s) from the current results file based
        on subsets of elements.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Specify which results to include for the subset of elements.

            ALL  - Write all nodal and element results based on the subset of elements (default).

            EXT  - Write only the nodal and element results that are on the exterior surface of
                   the element subset. The results data will be averaged as in
                   PowerGraphics (see AVRES) when this results file is brought
                   into POST1. Only valid for solid elements.

        label
            Define where the element subset is coming from.

            ALL  - Use all selected element components (CMSEL) (default).

            ESEL  - Use the currently selected (ESEL) set of elements. Name1 defines the results
                    file name.

            LIST - Use Name1 to Name16 to list the element component and/or assembly names (that
                   contain element components).

        name1, name2, name3, . . . , name16
            Up to 16 element component and/or assembly names (that contain
            element components).

        Notes
        -----
        Results files will be named based on the element component or assembly
        name, e.g., Cname.rst, except for the ESEL option, for which you must
        specify the results file name (no extension) using the Name1 field.
        Note that the .rst filename will be written in all uppercase letters
        (CNAME.rst) (unless using the ESEL option); when you read the file, you
        must specify the filename using all uppercase letters (i.e.,
        file,CNAME). You may repeat the RSPLIT command as often as needed. All
        results sets on the results file are processed. Use /AUX3 to produce a
        results file with just a subset of the results sets.

        Use INRES to limit the results data written to the results files.

        The subset geometry is also written so that no database file is
        required to postprocess the subset results files. You must not resume
        any database when postprocessing one of these results files. The input
        results file must have geometry written to it (i.e., do not use
        /CONFIG,NORSTGM,1).

        Applied forces and reaction forces are not apportioned if their nodes
        are shared by multiple element subsets. Their full values are written
        to each results file.

        Each results file renumbers its nodes and elements starting with 1.

        This feature is useful when working with large models. For more
        information on the advantages and uses of the RSPLIT command, see
        Splitting Large Results Files in the Basic Analysis Guide.

        expnd
            Mesh expansion (or contraction) factor.  (This factor is the same
            as MOPT,EXPND,Value.)  EXPND is used to size internal elements in
            an area based on the size of the elements on the area's boundaries.
            For example, issuing SMRTSIZE,,,2 before meshing an area will allow
            a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the
            interior of an area as they are on the boundary.   If EXPND is less
            than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the area
            will be allowed.  EXPND should be greater than 0.5 but less than 4.
            EXPND defaults to 1 for h-elements (size level 6), which does not
            allow expansion or contraction of internal element sizes (except
            when using AESIZE element sizing).  (If EXPND is set to zero, the
            default value of 1 will be used.)  The actual size of the internal
            elements will also depend on the TRANS option or upon AESIZE or
            ESIZE sizing, if used.

        trans
            Mesh transition factor.  (This factor is the same as
            MOPT,TRANS,Value.)  TRANS is used to control how rapidly elements
            are permitted to change in size from the boundary to the interior
            of an area.  TRANS defaults to 2.0 for h-elements (size level 6),
            which permits elements to approximately double in size from one
            element to the next as they approach the interior of the area.  (If
            TRANS is set to zero, the default value will be used.)   TRANS must
            be greater than 1 and, for best results, should be less than 4.
            The actual size of the internal elements will also depend on the
            EXPND option or upon AESIZE or ESIZE sizing, if used.

        angl
            Maximum spanned angle per lower-order element for curved lines.
            Defaults to 22.5 degrees per element (size level 6).  This angle
            limit may be exceeded if the mesher encounters a small feature
            (hole, fillet, etc.).  (This value is not the same as that set by
            DESIZE,,,,ANGL.)

        angh
            Maximum spanned angle per higher-order element for curved lines.
            Defaults to 30 degrees per element (size level 6).  This angle
            limit may be exceeded if the mesher encounters a small feature
            (hole, fillet, etc.).  (This value is NOT the same as that set by
            DESIZE,,,,,ANGH.)

        gratio
            Allowable growth ratio used for proximity checking.  Defaults to
            1.5 for h-elements (size level 6).  Values from 1.2 to 5.0 are
            allowed; however, values from 1.5 to 2.0 are recommended.

        smhlc
            Small hole coarsening key, can be ON (default for size level 6) or
            OFF.  If ON, this feature suppresses curvature refinement that
            would result in very small element edges (i.e., refinement around
            small features).

        smanc
            Small angle coarsening key, can be ON (default for all levels) or
            OFF.  If ON, this feature restricts proximity refinement in areas
            where it is ill-advised (that is, in tight corners on areas,
            especially those that approach 0 degrees).

        mxitr
            Maximum number of sizing iterations (defaults to 4 for all levels).

        sprx
            Surface proximity refinement key, can be off (SPRX = 0, which is
            the default for all levels) or on via two different values (SPRX =
            1 or SPRX = 2).  If SPRX = 1, surface proximity refinement is
            performed and any shell elements that need to be modified are
            modified.  If SPRX=2, surface proximity refinement is performed but
            no shell elements are altered.

        remeshopt
            OFF

            OFF - Do not remesh (default).

            ON - Remesh when element qualities fall below values specified by ARMAX, VOCH, or
                 ARCH as explained below. Valid only when Option is ON.

        elemset
            ALL

            ALL - Remesh all selected elements if the quality of the worst defined element falls
                  below any quality requirement (default when Remeshopt = ON).

        armax
            The maximum allowable element generalized aspect ratio. Defaults to

        voch
            The maximum allowable change of element size (area or volume).
            Defaults to 3.

            quality check takes place at the intervals defined by STEP.
            Defaults to 1 (quality check at every step).

        time
            A quality check takes place at the time point specified. Defaults
            to -1 (a quality check at every time point).

        stropt
            NO

            NO - There are no structural elements in the model (default).

            YES - There are no structural elements in the model and the morphing happens after
                  the structural solution.

        Notes
        -----
        MORPH is applicable to any non-structural field analysis (not including
        fluid elements). It activates displacement degrees of freedom for non-
        structural elements so that boundary conditions may be placed on the
        field mesh to constrain the movement of the non-structural mesh during
        morphing. It morphs the non-structural mesh using displacements
        transferred at the surface interface between the structural field and
        the non-structural field.  The displacements of non-structural elements
        are mesh displacements to avoid mesh distortion, but have no physical
        meaning except at the interface. MORPH does not support surface, link,
        or shell elements, or any element shape other than triangles, quads,
        tets, and bricks. Morphed fields must be in the global Cartesian system
        (CSYS = 0).

        After each remesh, new databases and results files are written with the
        extensions .rth0n and .db0n, where n is the remesh file number
        (FieldName.rth01, FieldName.rth02, ... and FieldName.db01,
        FieldName.db02, etc.).   The original database file is FieldName.dbo.
        The FieldName.db01, FieldName.db02, etc. files have elements that are
        detached from the solid model.

        Remeshing has the following restrictions:

        Valid only for the electrostatic elements (PLANE121, SOLID122, and
        SOLID123)

        Limited to triangle (2-D) and tetrahedral (3-D) options of these
        elements

         Valid only for the MFS solver

        No body loads allowed in the interior nodes of the remeshing domain

        Nodes on the boundary cannot be remeshed; remeshing will not work if
        morphing failed on the surface nodes

        Not suitable for extreme area or volume changes

        convergence difficulty occurs during solution, use the full Newton-
        Raphson procedure.

        The command NROPT,UNSYM is also valid in a linear non-prestressed modal
        analysis that is used to perform a brake squeal analysis. In this
        special case, the command is used only to generate the unsymmetric
        stiffness matrix; no Newton-Raphson iterations are performed.

        NROPT,MODI and NROPT,INIT are only applicable with the sparse solver
        (EQSLV,SPARSE). Thermal analyses will always use full Newton-Raphson
        irrespective of the Option1 value selected.

        See Newton-Raphson Option in the Structural Analysis Guide for more
        information.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Switching Between the Symmetric and Unsymmetric Option

        Normally, switching from the symmetric Newton-Raphson option
        (NROPT,FULL) to the unsymmetric option (NROPT,UNSYM) or from the
        unsymmetric option to the symmetric option is allowed between load
        steps within the same analysis type. This is applicable to linear and
        nonlinear, static and full transient analyses.

        Under the following circumstances, the solution could be slightly
        different or inaccurate if you switch from symmetric to unsymmetric or
        vice versa:

        The underlying elements or materials are unsymmetric by their
        mathematical definition, and you switch from unsymmetric to symmetric.

        You change analysis types and also switch from symmetric to unsymmetric
        (or vise versa) at the same time. This situation could result in
        failures such as data corruption or a core dump and should therefore be
        avoided.

        In some rare cases, switching between the symmetric and unsymmetric
        options can cause a system core dump when reading/writing the .ESAV or
        .OSAV file, and the analysis terminates. Typically, this happens when
        the record length of the element nonlinear saved variables cannot be
        altered between load steps by their mathematical definition.

        If all the elements and the material are symmetric by their
        mathematical definition and you use the unsymmetric option, the
        solution accuracy is the same as the symmetric option. However, the
        analysis will run twice as slow as the symmetric case.

        If the static or full transient solution is used as the base analysis
        for a linear perturbation, be aware that switching to the unsymmetric
        Newton-Raphson option forces the program to use the UNSYM or DAMP
        eigensolver in a downstream modal analysis, which may be more expensive
        than symmetric modal analysis.

            COND - Activates or deactivates condensation in the radiosity solver for all defined
                   radiation symmetries. Condensation is the process where the
                   radiosity equation system is reduced in size. Default is
                   off. (See Figure 7: Usage Example: Option = COND .)

        cs
            Local coordinate system (11) as defined using the LOCAL or CS
            commands or a global coordinate system (0). For planar reflection,
            the coordinate system origin must be on the plane of symmetry (POS)
            and one of its axes must be normal to the POS. For cyclic
            reflection, the coordinate system origin must be coincident with
            the center of rotation (COR). Only Cartesian systems are valid.

        axis
            Axis label of the coordinate system (CS) that is normal to the POS
            for planar reflection. For 2-D model planar reflections, valid
            labels are X or Y. For 3-D model planar reflections, valid labels
            are X, Y, or Z. Must be blank for cyclic reflection. For cyclic
            reflection, it is assumed that the Z axis is aligned with the axis
            of rotation.

        nsect
            Number of cyclic reflections to be done  (1). This field must be
            blank or 0 for planar reflection. Default is blank.

        condvalue
            Condensation key. Valid only when Option = COND.

            ON - Activates condensation in the radiosity solver for all defined radiation
                 symmetries.

            OFF - Deactivates condensation in the radiosity solver for all defined radiation
                  symmetries (default).

        Notes
        -----
        This command is used to define the POS for planar reflection or the COR
        for cyclic reflection. The RSYMM command must be issued before RSURF
        and it may be issued multiple times to have more than one planar/cyclic
        reflection; however, the RSURF command processes them in the order they
        are issued.

        For planar reflection, you must define a local coordinate system  (11)
        with its origin on the POS. One of its axes must be aligned so that it
        is normal to the plane. If possible, use the existing global coordinate
        system (0).

        For cyclic reflection, you must define a local coordinate system  (11)
        with its origin coincident with the COR. Reflections occur about the
        local Z-axis in the counterclockwise direction. You must align the
        Z-axis properly. If possible, use the existing global coordinate system
        (0).

        New surface elements generated inherit the properties of the original
        elements.

        For 2-D axisymmetric models, RSYMM can be used only for symmetrization
        in the YR plane. It cannot be used for the theta direction. Use V2DOPT
        in that case.

        For 2-D axisymmetric YR models, the newly-generated nodes can have only
        positive X coordinates.

        Notes
        -----
        When TOLERB is input as a tolerance value (TOLERB > 0), the typical
        force and/or moment from the regular time step is used in the midstep
        residual force and/or moment comparison.

        In a structural transient analysis, the suggested tolerance range of
        TOLERB (TOLERB > 0) is as follows:

        If the structural transient analysis is elastic and linear, and the
        load is constant or changes slowly, use a smaller value of TOLERB to
        achieve an accurate solution. If the analysis involves large amounts of
        energy dissipation, such as elastic-plastic material, TOLERB can be
        larger. If the analysis includes contact or rapidly varying loads, a
        smaller value of TOLERB should be used if high frequency response is
        important; otherwise, a larger value of TOLERB may be used to enable
        faster convergence with larger time step sizes.

        APDL Command: TUNIF

        Parameters
        ----------
        temp
            Uniform temperature assigned to the nodes. If a TEMP value is not
            specified, the uniform temperature is set to zero.

        Notes
        -----
        TUNIF is a convenient form of the more general BFUNIF command.

        In a transient or nonlinear thermal analysis, the uniform temperature
        is used during the first iteration of a solution as follows:

        as the starting nodal temperature (except where temperatures are
        explicitly specified [D, DK]),

        to evaluate temperature-dependent material properties.

        In a structural analysis or an explicit dynamic analysis, the uniform
        temperature is used as the default temperature for thermal strain
        calculations and material property evaluation (except where body load
        temperatures are specified (BF, BFE, BFK, LDREAD). In other scalar
        field analyses, the uniform temperature is used for material property
        evaluation.

        Because TUNIF (or BFUNIF,TEMP) is step-applied in the first iteration,
        issue a BF,ALL,TEMP,Value command to ramp on a uniform temperature
        load.

        When the TUNIF command is used in an explicit dynamic analysis, you
        cannot apply temperature loading via the EDLOAD,,TEMP command.
        Furthermore, temperature loading defined by TUNIF cannot be listed or
        deleted by the EDLOAD command.

        The command default sets the uniform temperature to the reference
        temperature defined via the TREF command only (and not the MP,REFT
        command).

        If using the command default to set the uniform temperature (to the
        reference temperature set via TREF), you can convert temperature-
        dependent secant coefficients of thermal expansion (SCTEs) from the
        definition temperature to the uniform temperature. To do so, issue the
        MPAMOD command.

        Jobname.ndxxx, Jobname.nrxxx, or Jobname.cnd files in the working
        directory to store the information you specify.

        For more information, see Performing Nonlinear Diagnostics.

        Issue the NLDIAG,NRRE,ON command to create Jobname.nrxxx diagnostic
        files (for each equilibrium iteration after the first) in which to
        store the relevant Newton-Raphson residual information of
        forces/moments Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My and Mz for the last MAXFILE
        equilibrium iterations.

        Issue a NLDPOST,NRRE,STAT command to list the load step, substep, time,
        and equilibrium iteration corresponding to each of the Jobname.nrxxx
        diagnostic files in the working directory, then issue a
        PLNSOL,NRRES,,,,FileID command to point to the file from which you want
        to create a contour plot of your Newton-Raphson residuals.

        If you restart or issue a new SOLVE command, any Jobname.nrxxx
        diagnostic files in the current (working) directory are overwritten.

        Issue a NLDIAG,EFLG,ON command to create Jobname.ndxxx  diagnostic
        files which store IDs for elements violating the following criteria:

        Too large a distortion (HDST)

        Elements contain nodes that have near zero pivots (PIVT) for nonlinear

        Elements for which mixed u-P constraints are not satisfied (mixed U-P
        option of 18x solid elements only) (MXUP)

        Hyperelastic element (EPHY), cohesive zone material (EPCZ), or damage
        strain (EPDM) not converged

        Radial displacement (RDSP) not converged

        MPC184 multipoint constraint elements using KEYOPT(1) = 6 through 16
        with the Lagrange multiplier option fail to satisfy constraint

        For NLDIAG,EFLG,ON, all Jobname.ndxxx diagnostic files (for each
        equilibrium iteration after the first) in the current (working)
        directory are deleted when you issue a new SOLVE command (or restart).

        In the solution processor (/SOLU), use the STAT option to list the
        active status of this command. In the postprocessor (/POST1), issue a
        NLDPOST,EFLG,STAT command to list the load step, substep, time, and
        equilibrium iteration corresponding to each of the Jobname.ndxxx
        diagnostic files in the working directory, then issue a
        NLDPOST,EFLG,CM,FileID command to create element components that
        violate the criteria.

        Issue the NLDIAG,CONT,ON command to create a Jobname.cnd diagnostic
        file which stores contact information for all defined contact pairs at
        all substeps. Alternatively, you may issue one of the following
        commands to store contact information at a specific frequency:

        NLDIAG,CONT,ITER to write at each iteration

        NLDIAG,CONT,SUBS to write at each substep (default)

        NLDIAG,CONT,LSTP to write at each load step

        Contact diagnostic information is available for elements CONTA171
        through CONTA177; it is not available for CONTA178.

        Diagnostic file Jobname.cnd is written during solution and lists, on a

        APDL Command: AESIZE

        Specifies the element size to be meshed onto areas.

        Parameters
        ----------
        anum
            Area number of the area to which this element size specification
            applies. If ANUM = ALL, size applies to all selected areas. If ANUM
            = P, graphical picking is enabled. A component name may also be
            substituted for ANUM.

        size
             Desired element size.

        Notes
        -----
        AESIZE allows control over the element sizing inside any area or on the
        face(s) of a volume.

        SIZE controls element size on the interior of the area. For any line on
        the area not having its own size assignment and not controlled by
        keypoint size assignments, it specifies the element size along the line
        as well, so long as no adjacent area has a smaller size, which would
        take precedence. If the AESIZE governs the boundary and SmartSizing is
        on, the boundary size can be refined for curvature or proximity.

        This command is also valid for rezoning.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kcn
            Specifies the active coordinate system, as follows:

            0 (default) - Cartesian

            1 - Cylindrical with global Cartesian Z as the axis of rotation

            2 - Spherical

            4 or WP - Working Plane

            5 - Cylindrical with global Cartesian Y as the axis of rotation

            11 or greater - Any previously defined local coordinate system

        Notes
        -----
        The CSYS command activates a previously defined coordinate system for
        geometry input and generation.  The LOCAL, CLOCAL, CS, CSKP, and CSWPLA
        commands also activate coordinate systems as they are defined. To set
        the active element coordinate system attribute pointer, issue the ESYS
        command.

        The active coordinate system for files created via the CDWRITE command
        is Cartesian (CSYS,0).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        CSYS,4 (or CSYS,WP) activates working plane tracking, which updates the
        coordinate system to follow working plane changes. To deactivate
        working plane tracking, activate any other coordinate system (for
        example, CSYS,0 or CSYS,11).

        CSYS,5 is a cylindrical coordinate system with global Cartesian Y as
        the axis. The local x, y and z axes are radial, θ, and axial
        (respectively). The R-Theta plane is the global X-Z plane, as it is for
        an axisymmetric model. Thus, at θ = 0.0, CSYS,5 has a specific
        orientation: the local x is in the global +X direction, local y is in
        the global -Z direction, and local z (the cylindrical axis) is in the
        global +Y direction.

        APDL Command: NLMESH

        Controls remeshing in nonlinear adaptivity.

        Parameters
        ----------
        control
            The mesh-quality control to adjust:

            NANG  - Specifies the surface facet dihedral angle threshold. Use this option to retain
                    source mesh geometry features. The dihedral angle is
                    defined by the angle between the normal vectors from two
                    neighboring surface facet sharing an edge. If the dihedral
                    angle is larger than the specified threshold, the edge is
                    treated as soft edge so that the new nodes are forced to
                    the edge.

            VAL1 is the dihedral angle threshold (in degrees) on concave surfaces. VAL2 is the dihedral angle threshold (in degrees) on convex surfaces.  - Default: VAL1 = 15 and VAL2 = 15.

            When NLMESH,EXPL is issued, the VAL1 and VAL2 become the lower bounds of dihedral angles for mesh exploration. Use VAL3 and VAL4 to define the upper bounds of dihedral angles on concave and convex surfaces (respectively) for mesh exploration. - Generally, larger VAL1 and VAL2 values lead to better quality new meshes (and
                              may even repair local tiny facets of poor
                              quality); however, larger values may also smooth
                              out some geometric features, leading to slightly
                              different results and causing possible
                              convergence difficulty in the substeps
                              immediately following remeshing.

            AEDG  - Specifies the edge angle threshold (in degrees). Use this option to split patch
                    segments. The edge angle is the angle between adjacent
                    surface segment edges sharing a node. If the edge angle is
                    larger than the specified threshold (VAL1), the segment
                    splits and the node is automatically treated as a hard node
                    to be retained.

            Default: VAL1 = 10. - Generally, larger VAL1 values improve the quality of the new mesh, but may
                              result in fewer feature nodes. The effect is
                              similar to that of dihedral angles.

            SRAT  - Specifies the global sizing ratio for remeshing.

            Generally, set the lower value (VAL1) to >= 0.7 and the upper value (VAL2) to <= 1.5. Within this range, the model can be refined (< 1.0) or coarsened (> 1.0) up to 3x depending on the number of elements (if performing a remesh of the entire model). - Default: VAL1 = 1.0. The default value results in the new mesh having a similar
                              size as that of the source mesh.

            NLAY - Specifies the number of sculpting layers beginning with detected seed elements.
                   This option helps to detect remeshing regions from whole
                   model.

            Default: VAL1 = 2. - Generally, a larger VAL1 value leads to larger remeshing regions and tends to
                              unite isolated multiple regions. A larger value
                              also tends to result in better remeshing quality
                              (and increases mapping and solution overhead
                              accordingly).

            VAL1 = 0 is not valid, as the remeshing regions would contain only detected seed elements, resulting in many small cavities within remeshing regions (especially if the specified skewness threshold (NLADAPTIVE) is relatively large). - When NLMESH,EXPL is issued, VAL1 becomes the lower bound of mesh exploration.
                              Use VAL2 to define the upper bound for mesh
                              exploration.

            LSRT  - Specifies the local sizing ratio threshold (VAL1). If the length of adjacent
                    segments over that of surface short segments exceeds the
                    specified threshold ratio, the neighboring segments are
                    candidates for local sizing to improve target mesh quality.

            Use local sizing in cases where any of the following conditions exist: - Short edges significantly smaller than average

            Poor surface mesh (triangles) on top edges - Small surface patches composed of few triangles caused by small user-specified
                              dihedral angles.

            Valid values are VAL1 >= 1.0. Default: VAL1 = 1.0. - When NLMESH, EXPL is issued, VAL1 becomes the lower bound of mesh exploration.
                              Use VAL2 to define the upper bound for mesh
                              exploration.

            For more information about this control, see "Notes". - EXPL

            Specifies the nonlinear mesh-exploration behavior. Mesh exploration consists of trying various mesh controls to obtain the best quality mesh during remeshing process. - For more information about this control, see "Notes".

            LIST  - Lists all defined advanced control parameters.

        val1, val2, val3, val4
            Numerical input values that vary according to the specified Control
            option.

        Notes
        -----
        NLMESH is a global control command enabling mesh-quality adjustments
        for remeshing in nonlinear adaptivity. The command can be used when
        components are associated with mesh-quality criteria (NLADAPTIVE with
        Criterion = MESH).

        Issue the NLMESH command only in cases where advanced mesh-quality
        control is desirable for remeshing in nonlinear adaptivity. The
        settings specified by this command apply to all components having mesh-
        quality-based criteria defined.

        Following are LSRT usage examples to help you determine a suitable
        threshold value for the local sizing ratio:

        If the value is only slightly greater than the minimum (and default)
        value of 1.0, local sizing is imposed on all segments. Recommended:
        VAL1 > 1.1.

        If the value is large enough such that no neighboring segments have
        lengths that would cause the threshold ratio to be exceeded, all
        segments are treated as though local sizing is disabled.

        For mesh exploration (NLMESH,EXPL,VAL1):

        VAL1 = 0 -- The exception to the default behavior (no mesh exploration)
        occurs when remeshing fails to create a mesh for the user-specified
        NLMESH input parameters. In this case, mesh exploration is performed as
        though VAL1 = 1, with default NANG upper bounds of 60,60 in order to
        continue the solution, and the lower bounds being user-specified.

        VAL1 = 1 -- The NANG lower and upper bounds must be input; otherwise,
        the command is ignored. The upper bound can be input for NLAY also, but
        the exploration still triggers remeshings with the whole model as seed
        elements.

        VAL1 = 2 -- The NANG lower and upper bounds must be input; otherwise,
        the command is ignored.

        VAL1 = 3 -- An optional upper bound can be specified via LSRT. By
        default, the upper bound is set to be 30 percent more than the (user-
        specified) lower bound.

        Mesh exploration is needed only when it is difficult to obtain a good
        quality mesh via standard remeshing. It is good practice to first try
        less aggressive exploration with VAL1 = 1.

        Checks for overconstraint among constraint equations and Lagrange

        Parameters
        ----------
        method
            Method used to determine which slave DOFs will be eliminated:

            TOPO - Topological approach (default). This method only works with constraint
                   equations; it does not work with Lagrange multipliers.

            ALGE - Algebraic approach.

            NONE - Do not use overconstraint detection logic.

        frequency
            Frequency of overconstraint detection for static or full transient
            analyses:

            ITERATION - For all equilibrium iterations (default).

            SUBSTEP - At the beginning of each substep.

            LOADSTEP - At the beginning of each load step.

        set
            Set of equations:

            All - Check for overconstraint between all constraint equations (default).

            LAG - Check for overconstraint only on the set of equations that involves Lagrange
                  multipliers. This is faster than checking all sets,
                  especially when the model contains large MPC bonded contact
                  pairs.

        Notes
        -----
        The OVCHECK command checks for overconstraint among the constraint
        equations (CE/CP) and the Lagrange multipliers for the globally
        assembled stiffness matrix. If overconstrained constraint equations or
        Lagrange multipliers are detected, they are automatically removed from
        the system of equations.

        The constraint equations that are identified as redundant are removed
        from the system and printed to the output file. It is very important
        that you check the removed equations—they may lead to convergence
        issues, especially for nonlinear analyses.

        The Frequency  and Set arguments are active only for the topological
        method (Method = TOPO). If you do not issue the OVCHECK command,
        overconstraint detection is performed topologically, and the slave DOFs
        are also determined topologically.

        Overconstraint detection slows down the run. We recommend using it to
        validate that your model does not contain any overconstraints. Then,
        you can switch back to the default method (no OVCHECK command is
        needed).

        As an example, consider the redundant set of constraint equations
        defined below:

        Equation number 2 will be removed by the overconstraint detection
        logic. However, this is an arbitrary decision since equation number 1
        could be removed instead. This is an important choice as the constant
        term is not the same in these two constraint equations. Therefore, you
        must check the removed constraint equations carefully.

        overconstraint detection, see Constraints: Automatic Selection of Slave
        DOFs  in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference

        nrepeat1, nrepeat2, nrepeat3
            The number of repetitions required for the element pattern. The

        type1, type2, type3
            The type of expansion requested.

            RECT - Causes a Cartesian transformation of DX, DY, and DZ for each pattern (default).

            POLAR - Causes a polar transformation of DR, D-Theta and DZ for each pattern.

            AXIS - Causes 2-D axisymmetric expansion (that is, rotates a 2-D model created in the
                   X-Y plane about the Y axis to create a 3-D model).

            LRECT - Causes a Cartesian transformation of DX, DY, and DZ for each pattern about the
                    current local coordinate system (specified via the CSYS
                    command).

            LPOLAR - Causes a polar transformation of DR, D-Theta, and DZ for each pattern about the
                     local coordinate system (specified via the CSYS command).

        method1, method2, method3
            The method by which the pattern is repeated.

            FULL - Causes a normal repeat of the pattern (default).

            HALF - Uses a symmetry transformation for alternate repeats (to produce an image of a
                   complete circular gear from the image of half a tooth, for
                   example).

        dx1, dy1, dz1, dx2, dy2, dz2, dx3, dy3, dz3
            The Cartesian or polar increments between the repeated patterns.
            Also determines the reflection plane. Reflection is about the plane
            defined by the normal vector (DX, DY, DZ). If you want no
            translation, specify a small nonzero value.  For a half-image
            expansion, the increment DX, DY, or DZ is doubled so that
            POLAR,HALF, ,45 produces full images on 90° centers, and RECT,HALF,
            ,1 produces full images on 2-meter centers.

        Notes
        -----
        You can use the /EXPAND command to perform up to three symmetry
        expansions at once (that is, X, Y, and Z which is equal to going from a
        1/8 model to a full model). Polar expansions allow you to expand a
        wheel section into a half wheel, then into the half section, and then
        into the whole.

        The command displays elements/results when you issue the EPLOT command
        or postprocessing commands.

        The command works on all element and result displays, except as noted
        below. As the graphic display is created, the elements (and results)
        are repeated as many times as necessary, expanding the geometry and, if
        necessary, the displacements and stresses.

        Derived results are not supported.

        The /EXPAND command has the following limitations:

        It does not support solid model entities.

        POLAR, FULL or HALF operations are meaningful only in global
        cylindrical systems and are unaffected by the RSYS or DSYS commands.
        Cartesian symmetry or unsymmetric operations also occur about the
        global Cartesian system.

        It does not average nodal results across sector boundaries, even for
        averaged plots (such as those obtained via the PLNSOL command).

        Axisymmetric harmonic element results are not supported for Type =
        AXIS.

        The /EXPAND command differs significantly from the EXPAND command in
        several respects:

        The uses of /EXPAND are of a more general nature, whereas the EXPAND
        command is intended primarily to expand modal cyclic symmetry results.

        /EXPAND does not change the database as does the EXPAND command.

        You cannot print results displayed via /EXPAND.

            to 0.  If KEY = 2 and ABS = 1, an absolute value falling between
            the MIN and MAX is displayed.   ABS = 1 lets you eliminate the
            display of numbers whose absolute values are less than a desired
            tolerance.  For example, if ABS = 1, MIN = 10 and MAX = 1e8, values
            such as .83646 and -5.59737 are not displayed.

        Notes
        -----
        The /PBC command adds degree of freedom constraint, force load, and
        other symbols to displays.

        Symbols are applied to the selected nodes only.  All arrow and
        arrowhead symbols are oriented in the nodal coordinate system and lie
        in two perpendicular planes.  Force arrows are scaled proportional to
        their magnitude. (If KEY =  1, use /VSCALE to change arrow length.)
        For scalar quantities, the specific component direction (i.e., x, y, or
        z) of the symbol has no meaning, but the positive or negative sense
        (e.g., positive or negative x) represents a positive or negative scalar
        value, respectively.

        The effects of the /PBC command are not cumulative (that is, the
        command does not modify an existing setting from a previously issued
        /PBC command).  If you issue multiple /PBC commands during an analysis,
        only the setting specified by the most recent /PBC command applies.

        Use /PSTATUS or /PBC,STAT to display settings.  Use /PBC,DEFA to reset
        all specifications back to default.  See the /PSF and /PBF commands for
        other display symbols.

        In a cyclic symmetry analysis, the /PBC command is deactivated when
        cyclic expansion is active (/CYCEXPAND,,ON). To view boundary
        conditions on the basic sector, deactivate cyclic expansion
        (/CYCEXPAND,,OFF) and issue this command:: : /PBC,ALL,,1

        Issuing the command /PBC,PATH, ,1 displays all defined paths.

        The /PBC command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            The rezoning method to employ:

        APDL Command: MODOPT

        Specifies modal analysis options.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method
            Mode-extraction method to be used for the modal analysis.

            LANB - Block Lanczos

            LANPCG - PCG Lanczos

            SNODE - Supernode modal solver

            SUBSP - Subspace algorithm

            UNSYM - Unsymmetric matrix

            DAMP - Damped system

            QRDAMP - Damped system using QR algorithm

            VT - Variational Technology

        nmode
            The number of modes to extract. The value can depend on the value
            supplied for Method. NMODE has no default and must be specified. If
            Method = LANB, LANPCG, or SNODE, the number of modes that can be
            extracted can equal the DOFs in the model after the application of
            all boundary conditions.

        freqb
            The beginning, or lower end, of the frequency range of interest.

        freqe
            The ending, or upper end, of the frequency range of interest (in
            Hz). The default for Method = SNODE is described below. The default
            for all other methods is to calculate all modes, regardless of
            their maximum frequency.

        cpxmod
            Complex eigenmode key. (Valid only when Method = QRDAMP or Method =
            UNSYM).

            AUTO - Determine automatically if the eigensolutions are real or complex and output
                   them accordingly. This is the default for Method = UNSYM.
                   Not supported for Method = QRDAMP.

            ON or CPLX - Calculate and output complex eigenmode shapes.

            OFF or REAL - Do not calculate complex eigenmode shapes. This is required if a mode-
                          superposition analysis is intended after the modal
                          analysis for Method = QRDAMP. This is the default for
                          this method.

        nrmkey
            Mode shape normalization key:

            OFF - Normalize the mode shapes to the mass matrix (default).

            ON - Normalize the mode shapes to unity instead of to the mass matrix.  If a
                 subsequent spectrum or mode-superposition analysis is planned,
                 the mode shapes should be normalized to the mass matrix
                 (Nrmkey = OFF).

        modtype
            Type of modes calculated by the eigensolver. Only applicable to the
            unsymmetric eigensolver.

            Blank - Right eigenmodes. This value is the default.

            BOTH - Right and left eigenmodes. The left eigenmodes are written to Jobname.LMODE.
                   This option must be activated if a mode-superposition
                   analysis is intended.

        blocksize
            The block vector size to be used with the Block Lanczos or Subspace
            eigensolver (used only when Method = LANB or SUBSP). BlockSize must
            be an integer value between 0 and 16. When BlockSize = zero or
            blank, the code decides the block size internally (normally, a
            value of 8 is used for LANB and a value of 6 is used for SUBSP).
            Typically, higher BlockSize values are more efficient under each of
            the following conditions:

        --
            Unused field.

        --
            Unused field.

        scalekey
            Matrices scaling key for acoustic-structural interaction:

            OFF - Do not scale the matrices (default).

            ON - Scale the matrices.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies modal analysis (ANTYPE,MODAL) options. Additional options
        used only for the Supernode (SNODE) eigensolver are specified by the
        SNOPTION command. Additional options used only for the Subspace (SUBSP)
        eigensolver are specified by the SUBOPT command. If Method = LANPCG,
        ANSYS automatically switches to the PCG solver internally for this
        modal analysis. You can further control the efficiency of the PCG
        solver with the PCGOPT and EQSLV commands.

        For models that involve a non-symmetric element stiffness matrix, as in
        the case of a contact element with frictional contact, the QRDAMP
        eigensolver (MODOPT, QRDAMP) extracts modes in the modal subspace
        formed by the eigenmodes from the symmetrized eigenproblem. The QRDAMP
        eigensolver symmetrizes the element stiffness matrix on the first pass
        of the eigensolution, and in the second pass, eigenmodes are extracted
        in the modal subspace of the first eigensolution pass. For such non-
        symmetric eigenproblems, you should verify the eigenvalue and eigenmode
        results using the non-symmetric matrix eigensolver  (MODOPT,UNSYM).

        The DAMP and QRDAMP options cannot be followed by a subsequent spectrum
        analysis. The UNSYM method supports spectrum analysis when
        eigensolutions are real.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Distributed ANSYS Restriction: The VT extraction method is not
        supported in Distributed ANSYS. All other extraction methods are
        supported. However, PCG Lanczos, SUBSP, UNSYM, DAMP, and QRDAMP are the
        only distributed eigensolvers that will run a fully distributed
        solution. The Block Lanczos and Supernode eigensolvers are not
        distributed eigensolvers; therefore, you will not see the full
        performance improvements with these methods that you would with a fully
        distributed solution.

                     on the module of the coefficient; the range is from blue
                     for the smallest values to red for the largest values. The
                     color map is:

        Notes
        -----
        This command is used to copy a matrix from the assembled global matrix
        file (.FULL file) as specified on the FILE command and write it in a
        postscript format to a new file named Fname.Ext (defaults to
        Jobname.PS). The matrix is symbolized by a grid in which the black or
        colored squares represent the nonzero coefficients of the matrix. The
        .FULL file must be available for this command to work properly.

        If the matrix is large, it may be difficult to display the postscript
        file. In this case, use Color = BLACK to reduce the postscript file
        size.

        The assembled global matrix file is created during solution depending
        on the analysis type, equation solver, and other solution options. By
        default, the assembled global matrix file is never deleted at the end
        of solution. For most analysis types, the Sparse direct solver and the
        ICCG solver write a .FULL file. All mode extraction methods used for
        buckling and modal analyses write a properly formatted .FULL file to be
        used with the PSMAT command.

        When copying the stiffness matrix for transient and harmonic analyses,
        be aware that the element mass matrix values (and possibly element
        damping matrix values) are incorporated into the globally assembled
        stiffness matrix.  Thus, the globally assembled stiffness matrix
        represents more than the stiffness of the model for these analysis
        types.  Please refer to the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for more
        details.

        The PSMAT command is not able to display a lumped mass matrix from a
        .FULL file generated by a harmonic analysis.

        When copying a .FULL file, the rows and columns corresponding to
        specified constraints (e.g., D commands) are eliminated from the system
        of equations and therefore are not written to the .PS file. In
        addition, rows and columns corresponding to eliminated (slave) degrees
        of freedom from coupling and/or constraint equations (e.g., CE, CP
        commands) are eliminated from the system of equations and are not
        written to the .PS file. The DOFs that are eliminated from any coupling
        and/or constraint equations are determined internally by the solution
        code and may not match what you specified via the CE/CP (or similar)
        commands.

        When copying a .FULL file, only the upper triangular part of the matrix
        will be written to the .PS  file if the matrix is symmetric; the full
        matrix is written if the matrix is unsymmetric. Only matrix
        coefficients that are greater than zero will be written.

        The WRFULL command, in conjunction with the SOLVE command, can be used
        to generate the assembled global matrix file and eliminate the equation
        solution process and results output process.

        The following command sequence shows typical usage of this command.

        Below is an example of an export of the stiffness matrix to a
        postscript format using the COLOR option.

            APPEN - Append data from results file to the existing data.

            ALLOC - Allocate (and zero) space for NPTS data points.

            PSD - Create a new set of frequency points for PSD calculations (replacing any
                  previously stored data and erasing any previously calculated
                  data).

        npts
            The number of time points (or frequency points) for storage (used
            only with Lab = ALLOC or PSD).  The value may be input when using
            POST26 with data supplied from other than a results file.  This
            value is automatically determined from the results file data with
            the NEW, APPEN, and MERGE options.  For the PSD option, NPTS
            determines the resolution of the frequency vector (valid numbers
            are between 1 and 10, defaults to 5).

        APDL Command: *MOPER

         Performs matrix operations on array parameter matrices.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parr
            The name of the resulting array parameter matrix.  See *SET for
            name restrictions.

        par1
            First array parameter matrix input to the operation. For Oper =
            MAP, this is an N x 3 array of coordinate locations at which to
            interpolate. ParR will then be an N(out) x M array containing the
            interpolated values.

        oper
            Matrix operations:

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, INVERT) - Square matrix invert: Inverts the n x n matrix in Par1 into ParR. The matrix
                              must be well conditioned.

            Warning:Non-independent or ill-conditioned equations can cause erroneous results. - For large matrices, use the APDL Math operation *LSFACTOR for efficiency (see
                              APDL Math).

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, MULT, Par2) - Matrix multiply: Multiplies Par1 by Par2.  The number of rows of Par2 must
                              equal the number of columns of Par1 for the
                              operation. If Par2 is input with a number of rows
                              greater than the number of columns of Par1,
                              matrices are still multiplied. However, the
                              operation only uses a number of rows of Par2
                              equal to the number of columns of Par1.

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, COVAR, Par2) - Covariance: The measure of association between two columns of the input matrix
                              (Par1).  Par1, of size m runs (rows) by n data
                              (columns) is first processed to produce a row
                              vector containing the mean of each column which
                              is transposed to a column vector (Par2) of n
                              array elements.  The Par1 and Par2 operation then
                              produces a resulting n x n matrix (ParR) of
                              covariances (with the variances as the diagonal
                              terms).

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, CORR, Par2) - Correlation: The correlation coefficient between two variables.  The input
                              matrix (Par1), of size m runs (rows) by n data
                              (columns), is first processed to produce a row
                              vector containing the mean of each column which
                              is then transposed to a column vector (Par2) of n
                              array elements.  The Par1 and Par2 operation then
                              produces a resulting n x n matrix (ParR) of
                              correlation coefficients (with a value of 1.0 for
                              the diagonal terms).

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, SOLV, Par2) - Solution of simultaneous equations:  Solves the set of n equations of n terms
                              of the form an1x1 + an2x2 + ... + annxn = bn
                              where Par1 contains the matrix of a-coefficients,
                              Par2 the vector(s) of b-values, and ParR the
                              vector(s) of x-results.  Par1 must be a square
                              matrix.  The equations must be linear,
                              independent, and well conditioned.

            Warning:Non-independent or ill-conditioned equations can cause erroneous results. - For large matrices, use the APDL Math operation *LSFACTOR for efficiency (see
                              APDL Math).

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, SORT, Par2, n1, n2, n3) - Matrix sort: Sorts matrix Par1 according to sort vector Par2 and places the
                              result back in Par1. Rows of Par1 are moved to
                              the corresponding positions indicated by the
                              values of Par2. Par2 may be a column of Par1 (in
                              which case it will also be reordered).
                              Alternatively, you may specify the column of Par1
                              to sort using n1 (leaving Par2 blank). A
                              secondary sort can be specified by column n2, and
                              a third sort using n3. ParR is the vector of
                              initial row positions (the permutation vector).
                              Sorting Par1 according to ParR should reproduce
                              the initial ordering.

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, NNEAR, Toler) - Nearest Node: Quickly determine all the nodes within a specified tolerance of a
                              given array.

            ParR is a vector of the nearest selected nodes, or 0 if no nodes are nearer than Toler. Par1 is the n x 3 array of coordinate locations. Toler defaults to 1 and is limited to the maximum model size. - (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, ENEAR, Toler)

            Nearest Element: Quickly determine the elements with centroids that are within a specified tolerance of the points in a given array. - ParR is a vector of the nearest selected elements, or 0 if no element centroids
                              are nearer than Toler. Par1 is the n x 3 array of
                              coordinate locations.

            (*MOPER, ParR, Par1, MAP, Par2, Par3, kDim, --, kOut, LIMIT) - Maps the results from another program onto your ANSYS finite element model. For
                              example, you can map pressures from a CFD
                              analysis onto your model for a structural
                              analysis.

            When you map results, the subsequent Par2 and Par3 arguments define your input values and their locations, and the arguments that follow determine the search area and interpolation schemes (see below). -  For Oper = MAP, output points are incorrect if they are not within the
                              boundaries (area or volume) set via the specified
                              input points. Also, calculations for out-of-bound
                              points require much more processing time than do
                              points that are within bounds.

        par2
            Second array parameter matrix input to the operation.  For the
            COVAR and CORR operations, this parameter must exist as a
            dimensioned array vector without specified values since its values
            (means) will be calculated as part of the operations. For MAP, this
            will be an {N(in) x M} array of values to be interpolated, where
            N(in) is the number of points to interpolate from, and M is the
            number of values at each point. For the ENEAR and NNEAR operations,
            this parameter specifies the tolerance for the search.

        par3
            Third array parameter, used for Oper = MAP. This is an N x 3 array
            of coordinate locations corresponding to the values in Par2.

        Notes
        -----
        The CNCHECK command provides information for surface-to-surface, node-
        to-surface, and line-to-line contact pairs (element types TARGE169,
        TARGE170, CONTA171, CONTA172, CONTA173, CONTA174, CONTA175, CONTA176,
        CONTA177). All contact and target elements of interest, along with the
        solid elements and nodes attached to them, must be selected for the
        command to function properly. For performance reasons, the program uses
        a subset of nodes and elements based on the specified contact regions
        (RID1, RID2, RINC) when executing the CNCHECK command.

        CNCHECK is available in both the PREP7 and SOLUTION processors, but
        only before the first solve operation (that is, only before the first
        load step or the first substep).

        If the contact and target elements were generated through mesh commands
        (AMESH, LMESH, etc.) instead of the ESURF command, you must issue
        MODMSH,DETACH before CNCHECK. Otherwise, CNCHECK will not work
        correctly.

        The following additional notes are available:

        The command CNCHECK,POST solves the initial contact configuration in
        one substep. After issuing this command, you can postprocess the
        contact result items as you would for any other converged load step;
        however, only the contact status, contact penetration or gap, and
        contact pressure will have meaningful values. Other contact quantities
        (friction stress, sliding distance, chattering) will be available but
        are not useful.

        Because Option = POST forces a solve operation, the PrepPost (PP)
        license does not work with CNCHECK,POST.

        If CNCHECK,POST is issued within the solution processor, the SOLVE    c

        This command prepares and runs multiple finite element solutions on the
        Structural domain and the Electrostatic domain of a model to collect
        sample points of data for ROM response curve fitting. The command
        requires a model database [RMANL] and two Physics Files (Structural
        domain, titled "STRU" and an Electrostatic domain, titled "ELEC"; see
        PHYSICS command). Also required is a complete ROM database generated
        from the ROM Tools.  The Cap = CHARGE method is preferred when
        capacitance to "infinity" is not required. Capacitance conductor pairs
        are defined by the RMCAP command.

        Writes geometry and load database items to a file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Selects which data to write:

            ALL - Write all appropriate geometry, material property, load, and component data
                  (default). Two files will be produced. Fname.Ext will contain
                  all data items mentioned in "Notes", except the solid model
                  data. Fnamei.Exti will contain the solid model geometry and
                  solid model loads data in the form of IGES commands. This
                  option is not valid when CDOPT,ANF is active.

            COMB - Write all data mentioned, but to a single file, Fname.Ext. Solid model geometry
                   data will be written in either IGES or ANF format as
                   specified in the CDOPT command, followed by the remainder of
                   the data in the form of ANSYS commands. More information on
                   these (IGES/ANF) file formats is provided in "Notes".

            DB - Write all database information except the solid model and solid model loads to
                 Fname.Ext in the form of ANSYS commands. This option is not
                 valid when CDOPT,ANF is active.

            SOLID - Write only the solid model geometry and solid model load data. This output will
                    be in IGES or ANF format, as specified in the CDOPT
                    command. More information on these (IGES/ANF) file formats
                    is provided in "Notes".

            GEOM - Write only element and nodal geometry data. Neither solid model geometry nor
                   element attribute data will be written. One file, Fname.Ext,
                   will be produced. Use CDREAD,DB to read in a file written
                   with this option. Element types [ET] compatible with the
                   connectivity of the elements on the file must first be
                   defined before reading the file in with CDREAD,DB.

            CM - Write only node and element component and geometry data to Fname.Ext.

            MAT - Write only material property data (both linear and nonlinear) to Fname.Ext.

            LOAD - Write only loads for current load step to Fname.Ext.

            SECT - Write only section data to Fname.Ext. Pretension sections are not included.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        fnamei
            Name of the IGES file and its directory path (248 characters
            maximum, including directory). If you do not specify a directory
            path, it will default to your working directory and you can use all
            248 characters for the file name.

        exti
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        fmat
            Format of the output file (defaults to BLOCKED).

            BLOCKED - Blocked format. This format allows faster reading of the output file. The time
                      savings is most significant when BLOCKED is used to read
                      .cdb files associated with very large models.

            UNBLOCKED - Unblocked format.

        Notes
        -----
        Load data includes the current load step only. Loads applied to the
        solid model (if any) are automatically transferred to the finite
        element model when this command is issued. CDWRITE writes out solid
        model loads for meshed models only. If the model is not meshed, the
        solid model loads cannot be saved. Component data include component
        definitions, but not assembly definitions. Appropriate NUMOFF commands
        are included at the beginning of the file; this is to avoid overlap of
        an existing database when the file is read in.

        Element order information (resulting from a WAVES command) is not
        written. The data in the database remain untouched.

        Solution control commands are typically not written to the file unless
        you specifically change a default solution setting.

        CDWRITE does not support the GSBDATA and GSGDATA commands, and these
        commands are not written to the file.

        The data may be reread (on a different machine, for example) with the
        CDREAD command. Caution: When the file is read in, the NUMOFF,MAT
        command may cause a mismatch between material definitions and material
        numbers referenced by certain loads and element real constants. See
        NUMOFF for details. Also, be aware that the files created by the
        CDWRITE command explicitly set the active coordinate system to
        Cartesian (CSYS,0).

        You should generally use the blocked format (Fmat = BLOCKED) when
        writing out model data with CDWRITE. This is a compressed data format
        that greatly reduces the time required to read large models through the
        CDREAD command. The blocked and unblocked formats are described in
        Chapter 3 of the Guide to Interfacing with ANSYS.

        If you use CDWRITE in any of the derived products (ANSYS Emag, ANSYS
        Professional), then before reading the file, you must edit the
        Jobname.cdb file to remove commands that are not available in the
        respective component product.

        The CDWRITE command writes PART information for any ANSYS LS-DYNA input
        file to the Jobname.cdb file via the EDPREAD command. (EDPREAD is not a
        documented command; it is written only when the CDWRITE command is
        issued.) The PART information can be automatically read in via the
        CDREAD command; however, if more than one Jobname.cdb file is read, the
        PART list from the last Jobname.cdb file overwrites the existing PART
        list of the total model. This behavior affects all PART-related
        commands contained in the Jobname.cdb file. You can join models, but
        not PART-related inputs, which you must modify using the newly-created
        PART numbers. In limited cases, an update of the PART list
        (EDWRITE,PUPDATE) is possible; doing so requires that no used
        combination of MAT/TYPE/REAL appears more than once in the list.

        The CDWRITE command does not support (for beam meshing) any line
        operation that relies on solid model associativity. For example,
        meshing the areas adjacent to the meshed line, plotting the line that
        contains the orientation nodes, or clearing the mesh from the line that
        contains orientation nodes may not work as expected. For more
        information about beam meshing, see Meshing Your Solid Model in the
        Modeling and Meshing Guide.

        IGES and ANF File Formats for Solid Model Geometry Information

        The format used for solid model geometry information is determined by
        the current CDOPT command setting. The default format is IGES.

        IGES option (default) to write solid model information (CDOPT, IGS):

        Before writing solid model entities, select all corresponding lower
        level entities (ALLSEL,BELOW,ALL).

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn
            The window number to which the expansion applies. Valid values are
            1 through 5. The default value is 1. The window number applies only
            to the AMOUNT argument.

        option
            One of the following options:

            ON - Activates cyclic expansion using the previous settings (if any). If no previous
                 settings exist, this option activates the default settings.

            DEFAULT - Resets cyclic expansion to the default settings.

            OFF - Deactivates cyclic expansion. This option is the default.

            STATUS - Lists the current cyclic expansion settings.

            AMOUNT - The number of repetitions or the total angle.

            Value1 - NREPEAT

            Value2 - The number of repetitions. The default is the total number of sectors in 360
                     degrees.

            or - Value1

            ANGLE - Value2

            The total angle in degrees. The default is 360. - WHAT

            A specified portion or subset of the model to expand: - Value1

            The component name of the elements to expand. The default is all selected components. - EDGE

            Sector edge display key. - -1

            Suppresses display of edges between sectors even if the cyclic count varies between active windows. - Caution:  Plots with fewer than the maximum number of repetitions may have
                              missing element faces at the sector boundaries.

            0 or OFF - Averages stresses or strains across sector boundaries. This value is the
                       default (although the default reverts to 1 or ON if the
                       cyclic count varies between active windows).

            1 or ON - No averaging of stresses or strains occurs and sector boundaries are shown on
                      the plot.

            PHASEANG - The phase angle shift:

            Value1 - The phase angle shift in degrees. The valid range is 0 through 360. The default
                     is 0. For a full harmonic solution, this value is
                     typically the phase angle obtained via the CYCPHASE

                     amplitude is supplied. The amplitude solution for non-
                     component results (such as equivalent stress) are not
                     valid. For a mode-superposition harmonic solution, if
                     Value1 = SWEEP, the maximum values across a phase angle
                     sweep are supplied.

        Notes
        -----
        In preprocessing, the /CYCEXPAND command verifies a cyclically
        symmetric model by graphically expanding it partially or through the
        full 360 degrees.

        For the postprocessing plot nodal solution (PLNSOL) operation, the
        command graphically expands displacements, stresses and strains of a
        cyclically symmetric model partially or though the full 360 degrees by
        combining the real (original nodes and elements) and imaginary
        (duplicate nodes and elements) parts of the solution.

        For the print nodal solution (PRNSOL) operation, the command expands
        the printed output of displacements or stresses on a sector-by-sector
        basis.

        Use of the /CYCEXPAND command does not change the database. The command
        does not modify the geometry, nodal displacements or element stresses.

        The command affects element and result plots only. It has no effect on
        operations other than plot element solution (PLESOL), plot nodal
        solution (PLNSOL), print nodal solution (PRNSOL), and calculate
        harmonic solution (CYCCALC). Operations other than PLESOL, PLNSOL,
        PRNSOL, or CYCCALC work on the unprocessed real and imaginary parts of
        a cyclic symmetry solution

        If you issue a /CYCEXPAND,,OFF command, you cannot then expand the
        model by simply issuing another  /CYCEXPAND command  (for example, to
        specify an NREPEAT value for the number of repetitions). In such a
        case, you must specify /CYCEXPAND,,ON, which activates expansion using
        the previous settings (if any) or the default settings.

        The command requires PowerGraphics and will turn PowerGraphics on
        (/GRAPHICS,POWER) if not already active. Any setting which bypasses
        PowerGraphics (for example, /PBF) also bypasses cyclic expansion; in
        such cases, the /CYCEXPAND command displays unprocessed real and
        imaginary results.

        The CYCPHASE command uses full model graphics (/GRAPHICS,FULL) to
        compute peak values. Because of this, there may be slight differences
        between max/min values obtained with CYCPHASE, and those obtained via
        /CYCEXPAND, which uses power graphics (/GRAPHICS,POWER).

        For PHASEANG = AMPLITUDE (or 360) with a cyclic full harmonic solution,
        the only appropriate coordinate system is the solution coordinate
        system (RSYS,SOLU)

        Cyclic Symmetry Analysis Guide.

            The window number to which the command applies. (defaults to 1)

        class
            The type (and relative importance) of legend item being displayed:

            CNTR - Contour legend. This legend item is controlled separately from the other legend
                   items (see note below).

            DATE - The items in the DATE class include the date and time, or the ANSYS graphical
                   logo (/PLOPTS,LOGO,1). This item is shown by default in all
                   plots.

            GWIN - The items in the GWIN class include the entity acronyms that appear in the
                   legend of a multiplot of entities (Nodes, Elements,
                   Keypoints, Lines, Areas, Volumes). GWIN items are shown by
                   default for all GPLOT displays.

            TYPE - Items in the TYPE class include the plot type (e.g. ELEMENTS, MATERIALS, NODAL
                   SOLUTIONS, etc.). TYPE items are shown by default in all
                   plots.

            TYP2 - Items in the TYP2 class include supplementary type information, such as DMAX
                   and SMAX for nodal solutions. TYP2 items are shown by
                   default in all plots.

            INUM - Items in the INUM class include the number labels generated by the /PNUM
                   command. This class is displayed by default in all plots
                   that contain /PNUM information.

            BCDC - The items in the BCDC class include labels created by the /PBC  command. This
                   class is shown by default in all plots which contain /PBC
                   information.

            VECT - Items in the VECT class include labels created by the PLVECT command. This
                   class is shown by default for all PLVECT plots.

            SURF - The items in the SURF class include labels from the /PSF legend. This class is
                   shown by default on all plots of surface boundary
                   conditions.

            BODY - Items from the BODY class include labels from the /PBF legend. This class is
                   shown by default in all plots of body forces.

            PSTA - Items from the PSTA class include stress scaling statistics, such as the
                   /SSCALE setting. This class is not shown as the default for
                   any type of plot, and must be specifically referenced to
                   display the included data.

            VIEW - The items in the VIEW class include view statistics. This class is not shown as
                   the default for any type of plot, and must be specifically
                   referenced to display the included data.

            MISC - The items in the MISC class include supplementary labels like /EXPANDED and
                   Stress Section Cross Section. This class is not shown as the
                   default for any type of plot, and must be specifically
                   referenced to display the included data.

        Notes
        -----
        The legend classes conform to the controls specified in the window
        options panel (PlotCtrls> Window Controls> Window Options). In many
        instances, the legend controls specified with the /PLOPTS command will
        take precedence and override /UDOC specifications. For instance:

        /PLOPTS,LEG1,OFF will disable the TYPE, TYP2, INUM, and MISC classes,
        regardless of the /UDOC settings.

        /PLOPTS,LEG2,OFF will disable the VIEW class, regardless of the /UDOC
        settings.

        /PLOPTS,LEG3,OFF will disable the PSTA class, regardless of the /UDOC
        settings.

        All items in a class are listed with the same X coordinate (except for
        contours). The contents of the text classes are dumped onto the display
        window from top to bottom, in order of class importance.

        The font specification for text items that are included in the user-
        specified legends are controlled with the /DEVICE command (PlotCtrls>
        Font Controls> Anno/Graph Font).

        The floating point values for the data presented in the legend(s) are
        controlled by the /GFORMAT command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        elem
            Element at which surface load is to be listed.  If ALL (or blank),
            list loads for all selected elements [ESEL].  If ELEM = P,
            graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields are

            labels.

        Notes
        -----
        The surface loads listed correspond to the current database values. The
        database is not updated for surface loads in POST1. Surface loads
        specified in tabular form, however, do list their values corresponding
        to the current results set in POST1.

        For SURF151 or SURF152 elements with an extra node for radiation and/or
        convection calculations (KEYOPT(5) = 1), the bulk temperature listed is
        the temperature of the extra node. If the thermal solution does not
        converge, the extra node temperature is not available for listing.

        Film effectiveness and free stream temperatures specified by the SFE
        command (Lab = CONV) can only be listed by this command. The command
        lists film coefficients and bulk temperatures first and then film
        effectiveness and free stream temperatures below those values.

        Distributed ANSYS Restriction: In Distributed ANSYS within the SOLUTION

        option
            Label identifying the option to be performed.

            ADD - Define termination criteria (default).

            DELE - Delete termination criteria.

            LIST - List termination criteria.

        lab
            Label identifying the type of termination (no default).

            NODE - Terminate solution based on nodal point coordinates. The analysis terminates
                   when the current position of the specified node reaches
                   either the maximum or minimum coordinate value (STOP = 1, 2,
                   or 3), or when the node picks up force from any contact
                   surface (STOP = 4).

            PART - Terminate solution based on rigid body (part) displacements. The analysis
                   terminates when the displacement of the center of mass of
                   the specified rigid body reaches either the maximum or
                   minimum value (STOP = 1, 2, or 3), or when the displacement
                   magnitude of the center of mass is exceeded (STOP = 4).

        num
            Node number (if Lab = NODE) or rigid body Part ID (if Lab = PART).
            (No default.)

        stop
            Criterion for stopping the solution (no default).

            1 - Global X-direction.

            2 - Global Y-direction.

            3 - Global Z-direction.

            4 - For Lab = NODE, stop the solution if contact occurs. For Lab = PART, stop the
                solution if the displacement magnitude is exceeded for the
                specified rigid body (use MAXC to define the displacement
                magnitude).

        maxc
            Maximum (most positive) coordinate value (Lab = NODE) or
            displacement (Lab = PART). MAXC defaults to 1.0e21

        minc
            Minimum (most negative) coordinate value (Lab = NODE) or
            displacement (Lab = PART). MINC defaults to -1.0e21.

        Notes
        -----
        You may specify multiple termination criteria using EDTERM; the
        solution will terminate when any one of the criteria is satisfied, or
        when the solution end time (specified on the TIME command) is reached.

        In an explicit dynamic small restart analysis (EDSTART,2) or full
        restart analysis (EDSTART,3), the termination criteria set in the
        previous analysis (the original analysis or the previous restart) are
        carried over to the restart. If the previous analysis terminated due to
        one of these criteria, that specific criterion must be modified so that
        it will not cause the restart to terminate prematurely. In particular,
        if a termination condition based on nodal contact (Lab = NODE, STOP =
        4) is satisfied, this condition must be deleted and replaced with a
        condition based on nodal coordinates for that same node. (If a
        condition based on nodal coordinates already exists for that node, the
        replacement is not necessary.) In the restart, the number of
        termination criteria specified using EDTERM cannot exceed a maximum of
        10 or the number specified in the original analysis.

        Note that the termination criteria set by EDTERM are not active during
        dynamic relaxation (EDDRELAX).

        overwritten.  Keypoints that are not attached to any line are written
        to the output file as IGES entity 116 (Point).  Lines that are not
        attached to any area are written to the output file as either IGES
        Entity 100 (Circular Arc), 110 (Line), or 126 (Rational B-Spline Curve)
        depending upon whether the ANSYS entity was defined as an arc, straight
        line, or spline.  Areas are written to the output file as IGES Entity
        144 (Trimmed Parametric Surface).  Volumes are written to the output
        file as IGES entity 186 (Manifold Solid B-Rep Object).  Solid model
        entities to be written must have all corresponding lower level entities
        selected (use ALLSEL,BELOW,ALL) before issuing command.  Concatenated
        lines and areas are not written to the IGES file; however, the entities
        that make up these concatenated entities are written.

        Caution:: : Section properties assigned to areas, lines and other solid
        model entities will not be maintained when the model is exported using
        IGESOUT.

        If you issue the IGESOUT command after generating a beam mesh with
        orientation nodes, the orientation keypoints that were specified for
        the line (LATT) are no longer associated with the line and are not
        written out to the IGES file.  The line does not recognize that
        orientation keypoints were ever assigned to it, and the orientation
        keypoints do not "know" that they are orientation keypoints.  Thus the
        IGESOUT command does not support (for beam meshing) any line operation
        that relies on solid model associativity.  For example, meshing the

        APDL Command: NSEL

        Selects a subset of nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Label identifying the type of select:

            S - Select a new set (default).

            R - Reselect a set from the current set.

            A - Additionally select a set and extend the current set.

            U - Unselect a set from the current set.

            ALL - Restore the full set.

            NONE - Unselect the full set.

            INVE - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            STAT - Display the current select status.

        Notes
        -----
        Selects a subset of nodes.  For example, to select a new set of nodes
        based on node numbers 1 through 7, use NSEL,S,NODE,,1,7.  The subset is
        used when the ALL label is entered (or implied) on other commands, such
        as NLIST,ALL.  Only data identified by node number are selected.  Data
        are flagged as selected and unselected; no data are actually deleted
        from the database.

        When selecting nodes by results, the full graphics value is used,
        regardless of whether PowerGraphics is on.

        Solution result data consists of two types, 1) nodal degree of freedom
        --results initially calculated at the nodes (such as displacement,
        temperature, pressure, etc.), and 2) element--results initially
        calculated elsewhere (such as at an element integration point or
        thickness location) and then recalculated at the nodes (such as
        stresses, strains, etc.).  Various element results also depend upon the
        recalculation method and the selected results location [AVPRIN, RSYS,
        FORCE, LAYER and SHELL].

        You must have all the nodes (corner and midside nodes) on the external
        face of the element selected to use Item = EXT.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        For Selects based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results, etc.),
        items that are within the range VMIN-Toler and VMAX+Toler are selected.
        The default tolerance Toler is based on the relative values of VMIN and
        VMAX as follows:

        If VMIN = VMAX, Toler = 0.005 x VMIN.

        If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, Toler = 1.0E-6.

         If VMAX ≠ VMIN, Toler = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

        Use the SELTOL command to override this default and specify Toler
        explicitly.

        Defines mass weighted (Alpha) or stiffness weighted (Beta) damping for

        Parameters
        ----------
        part
            PART number [EDPART] identifying the group of elements to which
            damping should be applied. If PART = ALL (default), damping is
            applied to the entire model.

        lcid
            Load curve ID (previously defined with the EDCURVE command)
            identifying the damping coefficient versus time curve. If time-
            dependent damping is defined, an LCID is required.

        valdmp
            Constant system damping coefficient or a scale factor applied to
            the curve defining damping coefficient versus time.

        Notes
        -----
        Mass-weighted (Alpha) or stiffness-weighted (Beta) damping can be
        defined with the EDDAMP command. Generally, stiffness proportional or
        beta damping is effective for oscillatory motion at high frequencies.
        This type of damping is orthogonal to rigid body motion and so will not
        damp out rigid body motion. On the other hand, mass proportional or
        alpha damping is more effective for low frequencies and will damp out
        rigid body motion. The different possibilities are described below:

        Distributed ANSYS Restriction: This command is not supported in
        Distributed ANSYS.

        Mass-weighted or Alpha damping

        When PART = (blank) or ALL (default), mass-weighted global damping can
        be defined in the following two ways. In this case, the same damping is
        applied for the entire structure.

        When the damping coefficient versus time curve (LCID) is specified
        using the EDCURVE command, VALDMP is ignored by LS-DYNA (although it is
        written in the LS-DYNA input file Jobname.K).  The damping force
        applied to each node in the model is given by fd = d(t)mv, where d(t)
        is the damping coefficient as a function of time defined by the EDCURVE
        command, m is the mass, and v is the velocity.

        When the LCID is 0 or blank (default), a constant mass-weighted system
        damping coefficient can be specified using VALDMP.

        The constant and time-dependent damping, described above, cannot be
        defined simultaneously. The last defined global damping will overwrite
        any previously defined global damping.

        Mass-weighted or Alpha damping

        When both a valid PART number is specified and the damping coefficient
        versus time curve (LCID) is specified using the EDCURVE command, mass-
        weighted time-dependent damping will be defined for the particular
        PART.  In this case, VALDMP will act as a scaling factor for the
        damping versus time curve (if VALDMP is not specified, it will default
        to 1). A valid PART number must be specified to define this type of
        damping. For example, use PART =1 (and not blank) when the entire model
        consists of only one PART.  Issue the command repeatedly with different
        PART numbers in order to specify alpha damping for different PARTS.

        Stiffness-weighted or Beta damping

        When a valid PART number is specified with LCID = 0 or (blank)
        (default), a stiffness-weighted (Beta) constant damping coefficient for
        this particular PART can be defined by VALDMP. The stiffness-weighted
        value corresponds to the percentage of damping in the high frequency
        domain. For example, 0.1 roughly corresponds to 10% damping in the high
        frequency domain. Recommended values range from 0.01 to 0.25. Values
        lower than 0.01 may have little effect. If a value larger than 0.25 is
        used, it may be necessary to lower the time step size significantly
        (see the EDCTS command). Issue the command repeatedly with different
        PART numbers in order to specify beta damping for different PARTS.
        Time-dependent stiffness-weighted damping is not available in ANSYS LS-
        DYNA.

        The mass-weighted and stiffness-weighted damping, described above,
        cannot be defined simultaneously for a particular PART number. The last
        defined damping for the particular PART number will overwrite any
        previously defined mass-weighted or stiffness-weighted damping for this
        PART.

        In order to define the mass-weighted and stiffness-weighted damping
        simultaneously, you can use the MP,BETD command (instead of the
        EDDAMP,PART, ,VALDMP command) to define stiffness-weighted (Beta)
        constant damping coefficient. However, do not use both of these
        commands together to define stiffness-weighted (Beta) constant damping
        coefficient for a particular PART. If you do, duplicate stiffness-
        weighted (Beta) constant damping coefficients for this PART will be
        written to the LS-DYNA input file Jobname.K.  The last defined value
        will be used by LS-DYNA. Also, note that the MP,BETD command is applied
        on the MAT number, and not on the PART number. Since a group of
        elements having the same MAT ID may belong to more than one PART (the
        opposite is not true), you need to issue the MP,BETD command only once
        for this MAT ID and the stiffness-weighted (Beta) damping coefficients
        will be automatically defined for all the PARTs with that MAT ID.

        Mass-weighted and stiffness-weighted damping can be defined
        simultaneously using the EDDAMP command only when mass-weighted damping
        (constant or time-dependent) is defined as global damping (EDDAMP, ALL,
        LCID, VALDMP) and stiffness-weighted damping is defined for all
        necessary PARTs (EDDAMP,PART, ,VALDMP).

        To remove defined global damping, reissue the EDDAMP, ALL command with
        LCID and VALDMP set to 0. To remove damping defined for a particular
        PART, reissue EDDAMP, PART, where PART is the PART number, with LCID
        and VALDMP set to 0. There is no default for the EDDAMP command, i.e.,
        issuing the EDDAMP command with PART = LCID = VALDMP = 0 will result in
        an error. Stiffness-weighted damping defined by the MP,BETD command can
        be deleted using MPDELE, BETD, MAT.

        In an explicit dynamic small restart (EDSTART,2) or full restart
        analysis (EDSTART,3), you can only specify global alpha damping. This
        damping will overwrite any alpha damping input in the original
        analysis. If you do not input global alpha damping in the restart, the
        damping properties input in the original analysis will carry over to
        the restart.

        Damping specified by the EDDAMP command can be listed, along with other
        explicit dynamics specifications, by typing the command string
        EDSOLV$STAT into the ANSYS input window. Beta damping specified by the
        MP,BETD command can be listed by MPLIST, MAT command.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

            Do this generation operation a total of ITIMEs, incrementing all
            keypoints in the given pattern automatically (or by KINC) each time
            after the first.  ITIME must be more than 1 for generation to

        na1, na2, ninc
            Generate areas from the pattern of areas NA1 to NA2 (defaults to
            NA1) in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).  If NA1 = ALL, NA2 and NINC

            D θ, DZ for cylindrical;  --, D θ, -- for spherical).

        kinc
            Keypoint number increment between generated sets.  If zero, the
            lowest available keypoint numbers are assigned [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies if elements and nodes are also to be generated:

            0 - Generate nodes and elements associated with the original areas, if they exist.

            1 - Do not generate nodes and elements.

        imove
            Specifies whether to redefine the existing areas:

            0 - Generate new areas as requested with the ITIME argument.

            1 - Move original areas to new position, retaining the same keypoint numbers
                (ITIME, KINC, and NOELEM are ignored).  If the original areas
                are needed in the original position (e.g.,  they may be
                attached to a volume), they are not moved, and new areas are
                generated instead.  Meshed items corresponding to moved areas

        Notes
        -----

        of the generated lines remain the same (in the active coordinate

        different from the pattern (i.e., radial generations in cylindrical
        systems, radial and phi generations in spherical systems, and theta
        generations in elliptical systems) are not allowed.  Solid modeling in

            Immediate mode key:

            0 - Display only upon request, i.e., no immediate display (default with the GUI
                off).

        Notes
        -----
        Allows immediate display of a model (as it is generated) without a
        screen erase or a display request.  Available only during an
        interactive session at a graphics display terminal.  A valid graphics
        device name must first be specified on the /SHOW command.

        The IMMED command allows you to control whether or not the model is
        displayed immediately as it is generated in an interactive session.  By
        default in the GUI, your model will immediately be displayed in the
        Graphics Window as you create new entities (such as areas, keypoints,
        nodes, elements, local coordinate systems, boundary conditions, etc.).
        This is called immediate mode graphics.  Also note that symbols (such
        as boundary conditions, local coordinate system triads, etc.) are shown
        immediately and will be present on subsequent displays unless you "turn
        off" the appropriate symbol using the GUI plot controls function or the
        appropriate graphics specification command.

        An immediate image will also be automatically scaled to fit nicely
        within the Graphics Window -- a feature called automatic scaling.  The
        new scaling is usually apparent on the automatic replot associated with
        immediate mode.  To suppress automatic replot, issue /UIS,REPLOT,0.
        (With automatic replot suppressed, the immediate image may not always
        be automatically scaled correctly.)

        Note:: : An immediate display in progress should not be aborted with
        the usual system "break" feature (or else the ANSYS session itself will
        be aborted).  When you run the ANSYS program interactively without
        using the GUI, immediate mode is off by default.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rangefact
            Factor used to control the range of eigenvalues computed for each
            supernode. The value of RangeFact must be a number between 1.0 and
            5.0. By default the RangeFact value is set to 2.0, which means that
            all eigenvalues between 0 and 2*FREQE are computed for each
            supernode (where FREQE is the upper end of the frequency range of
            interest as specified on the MODOPT command). As the RangeFact
            value increases, the eigensolution for the SNODE solver becomes
            more accurate and the computational time increases.

        blocksize
            BlockSize to be used when computing the final eigenvectors. The
            value of Blocksize must be either MAX or a number between 1 and
            NMODE, where NMODE is the number of modes to be computed as set on
            the MODOPT command. Input a value of MAX to force the algorithm to
            allocate enough memory to hold all of the final eigenvectors in
            memory and, therefore, only read through the file containing the
            supernode eigenvectors once. Note that this setting is ONLY
            recommended when there is sufficient physical memory on the machine
            to safely hold all of the final eigenvectors in memory.

        robustlev
            Parameter used to control the robustness of the SNODE eigensolver.
            The value of RobustLev must be a number between 0 and 10.  Lower
            values of RobustLev allow the eigensolver to run in the most
            efficient manner for optimal performance.  Higher values of
            RobustLev often slow down the performance of the eigensolver, but
            can increase the robustness; this may be desirable if a problem is
            detected with the eigensolver or its eigensolution.

        compute
            Key to control which computations are performed by the Supernode
            eigensolver:

            EVALUE - The eigensolver computes only the eigenvalues.

            EVECTOR - The eigensolver computes only the eigenvectors (must be preceded by a modal
                      analysis where the eigenvalues were computed using the
                      Supernode eigensolver).

            BOTH - The eigensolver computes both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the same pass
                   (default).

        --
            Unused field

        solve_info
            Solver output option:

            OFF - Turns off additional output printing from the Supernode eigensolver (default).

            PERFORMANCE - Turns on additional output printing from the Supernode eigensolver, including a
                          performance summary and a summary of file I/O for the
                          Supernode eigensolver. Information on memory usage

                          creation of the Jobname.FULL file) is also printed
                          with this option.

        Notes
        -----
        This command specifies options for the Supernode (SNODE) eigensolver.

        Setting RangeFact to a value greater than 2.0 will improve the accuracy
        of the computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but will often increase
        the computing time of the SNODE eigensolver. Conversely, setting
        RangeFact to a value less than 2.0 will deteriorate the accuracy of the
        computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors, but will often speedup the
        computing time of the SNODE eigensolver.  The default value of 2.0 has
        been set as a good blend of accuracy and performance.

        The SNODE eigensolver reads the eigenvectors and related information
        for each supernode from a file and uses that information to compute the
        final eigenvectors.  For each eigenvalue/eigenvector requested by the
        user, the program must do one pass through the entire file that
        contains the supernode eigenvectors.  By choosing a BlockSize value
        greater than 1, the program can compute BlockSize number of final
        eigenvectors for each pass through the file.  Therefore, smaller values
        of BlockSize result in more I/O, and larger values of BlockSize result
        in less I/O.  Larger values of  BlockSize also result in significant
        additional memory usage, as BlockSize number of final eigenvectors must
        be stored in memory. The default Blocksize of min(NMODE,40) is normally
        a good choice to balance memory and I/O usage.

        The RobustLev field should only be used when a problem is detected with
        the accuracy of the final solution or if the Supernode eigensolver
        fails while computing the eigenvalues/eigenvectors. Setting RobustLev
        to a value greater than 0 will cause the performance of the eigensolver
        to deteriorate. If the performance deteriorates too much or if the
        eigensolver continues to fail when setting the RobustLev field to
        higher values, then switching to another eigensolver such as Block
        Lanczos or PCG Lanczos is recommended.

        Setting Compute = EVALUE causes the Supernode eigensolver to compute
        only the requested eigenvalues.  During this process a Jobname.SNODE
        file is written; however, a Jobname.MODE file is not written. Thus,
        errors will likely occur in any downstream computations that require
        the Jobname.MODE file (for example, participation factor computations,
        mode superpostion transient/harmonic analysis, PSD analysis). Setting
        Compute = EVECTOR causes the Supernode eigensolver to compute only the
        corresponding eigenvectors. The Jobname.SNODE file and the associated
        Jobname.FULL file are required when requesting these eigenvectors. In
        other words, the eigenvalues must have already been computed for this
        model before computing the eigenvectors. This field can be useful in
        order to separate the two steps (computing eigenvalues and computing
        eigenvectors).

        -----
        This command creates the input file Fname.aqwa for the ANSYS Aqwa
        Multi-Body Hydrodynamics System for diffraction analysis in AQWA-LINE
        from the model currently in the database, based on the currently
        selected set of elements. The selected set must only include the hull
        envelope; no internal structure should be selected.

        There should be a line of nodes defined at the waterline. Only those
        elements that are entirely below the waterline will be specified as
        diffracting. If there are no waterline nodes, there will be no
        diffracting elements at the waterline, which will severely reduce the
        accuracy of the diffraction analysis.

        The translator maps PLANE42, SHELL41, SHELL63, and SHELL181 elements to
        PANELs, and maps PIPE16 and PIPE59 elements to TUBEs. It does not
        recognize any other element types. Any material or geometric properties
        can be used for the shell elements, as AQWA does not need any
        properties at all and the command does not use them. All the shell
        elements below the water must have their normals pointing outward.

        TUBE elements in AQWA have material density, outside diameter, wall
        thickness, added mass, and drag coefficients, so appropriate properties
        should be used in the ANSYS model. PIPE59 elements can have added mass
        and damping coefficients; these will be written to the file. The ANSYS
        program uses the inertia coefficient CM, whereas AQWA uses the added
        mass coefficient CA, where CM = (1 + CA). This correction is made
        automatically.

        In AQWA the vertical axis is always the Z-axis. The command can convert
        a model built with either the Y or Z-axis vertical, but the X-axis must
        be horizontal and should preferably be along the fore/aft axis of the
        vessel.  If the structure is symmetric and you wish to use the symmetry
        options, you must only select one half or one quarter of the model, as
        appropriate. If you model a complete vessel and specify X symmetry, the
        AQWA model will contain two sets of coincident elements.

        If you are working from a model created for a structural analysis, it
        will probably be necessary to remesh the model as the structural mesh
        is most likely finer than needed for a diffraction analysis.

        If you enter this command interactively (with the GUI active) and no
        data is provided for the command options, you will be prompted for
        their values.

        stloc
            Starting location for entering VAL data, below.  For example, if

            element body load item available for the element type, VAL2 applies
            to the second element item, etc. If STLOC = 5, data input in the

            body load values at the starting location and subsequent locations

            a uniform body load across the element.  For nonuniform loads, the
            values must be input in the same order as shown in the input table
            for the element type.  Values initially default to the BFUNIF value
            (except for CHRGD which defaults to zero).  For subsequent
            specifications, a blank leaves a previously specified value
            unchanged; if the value was not previously specified, the default

        Defines an element body force load (such as temperature in a structural
        analysis, heat generation rate in a thermal analysis, etc.). Body loads
        and element specific defaults are described for each element type in
        the Element Reference. If both the BF and BFE commands are used to
        apply a body load to an element, the BFE command takes precedence.

        For heat-generation (HGEN) loading on layered thermal solid elements
        SOLID278 / SOLID279 (KEYOPT(3) = 1 or 2), or layered thermal shell
        elements SHELL131 / SHELL132 (KEYOPT(3) = 1), STLOC refers to the layer
        number (not the node). In such cases, use VAL1 through VAL4 to specify
        the heat-generation values for the appropriate layers. Heat generation
        is constant over the layer.

        Specifying a Table

        You can specify a table name (VAL1) when using temperature (TEMP),
        diffusing substance generation rate (DGEN), heat generation rate
        (HGEN), and current density (JS) body load labels.

        Enclose the table name (tabname) in percent signs (%), as shown:

        BFE,Elem, Lab,STLOC,%tabname%

        Use the *DIM command to define a table.

        For Lab = TEMP, each table defines NTEMP temperatures, as follows:

        For layered elements, NTEMP is the number of layer interface corners
        that allow temperature input.

        For non-layered elements, NTEMP is the number of corner nodes.

        The temperatures apply to element items with a starting location of
        STLOC + n, where n is the value field location (VALn) of the table name
        input.

        For layered elements, a single BFE command returns temperatures for one
        layer interface. Multiple BFE commands are necessary for defining all
        layered temperatures.

        For beam, pipe and elbow elements that allow multiple temperature
        inputs per node, define the tabular load for the first node only (Node
        I), as loads on the remaining nodes are applied automatically. For
        example, to specify a tabular temperature load on a PIPE288 element
        with the through-wall-gradient option (KEYOPT(1) = 0), the BFE command
        looks like this:

        BFE,Elem,TEMP,1,%tabOut%, %tabIn%

        When a tabular function load is applied to an element, the load does
        not vary according to the positioning of the element in space.

            Node, label, and coefficient for third term.

        Notes
        -----
        Repeat the CE command to add additional terms to the same equation.  To
        change only the constant term, repeat the command with no node terms
        specified.  Only the constant term can be changed during solution, and
        only with the CECMOD command.

        Linear constraint equations may be used to relate the degrees of
        freedom of selected nodes in a more general manner than described for
        nodal coupling [CP].  The constraint equation is of the form:

        where U(I) is the degree of freedom (displacement, temperature, etc.)
        of term (I).  The following example is a set of two constraint
        equations, each containing three terms:

        0.0 = 3.0* (1 UX) + 3.0* (4 UX) + (-2.0)* (4 ROTY)

        2.0 = 6.0* (2 UX) + 10.0* (4 UY) + 1.0* (3 UZ)

        The first unique degree of freedom in the equation is eliminated in
        terms of all other degrees of freedom in the equation.  A unique degree
        of freedom is one which is not specified in any other constraint
        equation, coupled node set, specified displacement set, or master
        degree of freedom set.  It is recommended that the first term of the
        equation be the degree of freedom to be eliminated.  The first term of
        the equation cannot contain a master degree of freedom, and no term can
        contain coupled degrees of freedom.  The same degree of freedom may be
        specified in more than one equation but care must be taken to avoid
        over-specification (over-constraint).

        The degrees of freedom specified in the equation (i.e., UX, UY, ROTZ,
        etc.) must also be included in the model (as determined from the
        element types [ET]).  Also, each node in the equation must be defined
        on an element (any element type containing that degree of freedom will
        do).

        For buckling and modal analyses, the constant term of the equation will
        not be taken into account (that is, CONST is always zero).

        Note that under certain circumstances a constraint equation generated
        by CE may be modified during the solution. See Program Modification of
        Constraint Equations for more information.

        xcenter, ycenter
            Working plane X and Y coordinates of the center axis of the cone.

        rad1, rad2
            Radii of the faces of the cone.  RAD1 defines the bottom face and

            and is parallel to the working plane.  A value of zero or blank for

        Distributes the force/moment applied at the master node to a set  of
        slave nodes, taking into account the geometry of the slave nodes as
        well as weighting factors.

        Parameters
        ----------
        master
            Node at which the force/moment to be distributed will be applied.
            This node must be associated with an element for the master node to
            be included in the DOF solution.

        dof
            Refers to the master node degrees of freedom to be used in
            constraint equations. Valid labels are: UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY,
            ROTZ, UXYZ, RXYZ, ALL

        slaves
            The name of an array parameter that contains a list of slave nodes.
            Must specify the starting index number. ALL can be used for
            currently selected set of nodes. The slave nodes may not be
            colinear, that is, not be all located on the same straight line
            (see Notes below).

        wtfact
            The name of an array parameter that contains a list of weighting
            factors corresponding to each slave node above. Must have the
            starting index number. If not specified, the weighting factor for
            each slave node defaults to 1.

        Notes
        -----
        The force is distributed to the slave nodes proportional to the
        weighting factors. The moment is distributed as forces to the slaves;
        these forces are proportional to the distance from the center of
        gravity of the slave nodes times the weighting factors.  Only the
        translational degrees of freedom of the slave nodes are used for
        constructing the constraint equations. Constraint equations are
        converted to distributed forces/moments on the slave nodes during
        solution.

        RBE3 creates constraint equations such that the motion of the master is
        the average of the slaves. For the rotations, a least-squares approach
        is used to define the "average rotation" at the master from the
        translations of the slaves. If the slave nodes are colinear, then one
        of the master rotations that is parallel to the colinear direction can
        not be determined in terms of the translations of the slave nodes.
        Therefore, the associated moment component on the master node in that
        direction can not be transmitted. When this case occurs, a warning
        message is issued and the constraint equations created by RBE3 are
        ignored.

        Applying this command to a large number of slave nodes may result in
        constraint equations with a large number of coefficients. This may
        significantly increase the peak memory required during the process of
        element assembly. If real memory or virtual memory is not available,
        consider reducing the number of slave nodes.

        As an alternative to the RBE3 command, you can apply a similar type of
        constraint using contact elements and the internal multipoint
        constraint (MPC) algorithm. See Surface-based Constraints for more
        information.

        This command is also valid in SOLUTION.

        sepo
            Behavior if the intersection of the NA1 areas and the NA2 areas is
            a line or lines:

            (blank) - The resulting areas will share line(s) where they touch.

        Notes
        -----
        Generates new areas by subtracting the regions common to both NA1 and
        NA2 areas (the intersection) from the NA1 areas.  The intersection can

        Notes

        Assigns a user-defined command name to a user-programmable (system-
        dependent) subroutine.  This feature allows user-defined commands to be
        programmed into the ANSYS program.  Once programmed, this command can
        be input to the program like other commands, and can also be included
        in the ANSYS start-up file.  See *ULIB for another way of defining user
        commands.

        Up to 10 subroutines are available for user-defined commands (USER01 to
        USER10).  Users must have system permission, system access, and
        knowledge to write, compile, and link the appropriate subprocessors
        into the ANSYS program at the site where it is to be run.  All routines
        should be written in FORTRAN. For more information on FORTRAN compilers
        please refer to either the ANSYS, Inc. Windows Installation Guide or
        the ANSYS, Inc. Linux Installation Guide for details specific to your
        platform or operating system. The USER01 routine is commented and
        should be listed from the distribution media (system dependent) for
        more details.  Issue /UCMD,STAT to list all user-defined command names.
        Since a user-programmed command is a nonstandard use of the program,
        the verification of any ANSYS run incorporating these commands is
        entirely up to the user.  In any contact with ANSYS customer support
        regarding the performance of a custom version of the ANSYS program, you
        should explicitly state that a user programmable feature has been used.
        See the Advanced Analysis Guide for a general description of user-

        lab
            The offset type:

            NODE  - Offset the node IDs.

            ELEM  - Offset the element IDs.

        offset
            A positive integer value specifying the offset value to apply. The
            value must be greater than the number of nodes or elements in the
            existing superelement results file.

        Notes
        -----
        The RSTOFF command offsets node or element IDs in the FE geometry
        record saved in the .rst results file. Use the command when expanding
        superelements in a bottom-up substructuring analysis (where each
        superelement is generated individually in a generation pass, and all
        superelements are assembled together in the use pass).

        With appropriate offsets, you can write results files with unique node
        or element IDs and thus display the entire model even if the original
        superelements have overlapping element or node ID sets. (Such results
        files are incompatible with the .db database file saved at the
        generation pass.)

        The offset that you specify is based on the original superelement node
        or element numbering, rather than on any offset specified via a SESYMM
        or SETRAN command. When issuing an RSTOFF command, avoid specifying an
        offset that creates conflicting node or element numbers for a
        superelement generated via a SESYMM or SETRAN command.

        If you issue the command to set non-zero offsets for node or element
        IDs, you must bring the geometry into the database via the SET command
        so that ANSYS can display the results. You must specify appropriate
        offsets to avoid overlapping node or element IDs with other
        superelement results files.

        The command is valid only in the first load step of a superelement
        expansion pass.

        APDL Command: OCTABLE

        Defines an ocean load using table data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        val1, val2, val3, . . . , val6
            Values describing the basic ocean load, a current condition, or a
            wave condition.

        Notes
        -----
        The OCTABLE specifies table data that defines the ocean load. The terms
        VAL1, VAL2, etc. are specialized according to the input set required
        for the given ocean load.

        The program interprets the data input via the OCTABLE command within
        the context of the most recently issued OCTYPE command.

        There is no limit to the number of data input.

        Input values in the order indicated.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        You can define the following ocean data types:

        If the current is constant, only one OCTABLE command is necessary and
        Dep  is not required.

        For waves, the current profile is stretched or compressed linearly up
        to 10 percent.

        The first Dep value (representing the mean sea level) must be zero. The
        last Dep value (representing the mud line) must be equal to the DEPTH
        value input on the OCDATA command.

        The Cartesian Z values used to locate nodes, etc. decrease as one moves
        from the ocean surface to the sea floor, but the Dep values increase.
        See Figure: 5:: Basic Ocean Data Type Components .

        Dep is not affected by changes to Zmsl on the OCDATA command, as that
        value simply relocates the origin.

        When specifying an ocean wave type, issue the OCTABLE command to input
        either wave location data or wave spectrum data.

        Hints for Wave Location Input:

        The TIME command is not used, except perhaps to identify the load case.

                The phase shift (Ps) determines the wave position (that is, the
        point at which the load is to be applied).

        When using the Stokes fifth-order (KWAVE = 2) or stream function (KWAVE
        = 3) wave type, issue only one OCTABLE command.

        The valid range of the order of the stream function (NORDER) is 3
        through 50. If no value is specified, the program determines a value
        automatically.

        When using the diffracted wave type (KWAVE = 8), an OCREAD command is
        also required to read in the hydrodynamic data from the hydrodynamic
        analysis.

        --
            Unused field.

        ninc
            Increment nodes in the given pattern by NINC.

        iel1, iel2, ieinc
            Reflect elements from pattern beginning with IEL1 to IEL2 (defaults
            to IEL1) in steps of IEINC (defaults to 1). If IEL1 = ALL, IEL2 and
            IEINC are ignored and pattern is all selected elements [ESEL].  If
            IEL1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command
            fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI). A component name may
            also be substituted for IEL1 (IEL2 and IEINC are ignored).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates additional elements from a given pattern (similar to EGEN)
        except with a "symmetry" reflection. The operation generates a new
        element by incrementing the nodes on the original element, and
        reversing and shifting  the node connectivity pattern. For example, for
        a 4-node 2-D element, the nodes in positions I, J, K, and L of the
        original element are placed in positions J, I, L, and K of the
        reflected element.

        Similar permutations occur for all other element types. For line
        elements, the nodes in positions I and J of the original element are
        placed in positions J and I of the reflected element. In releases prior
        to ANSYS 5.5, no node pattern reversing and shifting occurred for line
        elements generated by ESYM. To achieve the same results with ANSYS 5.5
        as you did in prior releases, use the EGEN command instead.

        It is recommended that symmetry elements be displayed and graphically
        reviewed.

        If the nodes are also reflected (as with the NSYM command) this pattern
        is such that the orientation of the symmetry element remains similar to
        the original element (i.e., clockwise elements are generated from
        clockwise elements).

        For a non-reflected node pattern, the reversed orientation has the
        effect of reversing the outward normal direction (clockwise elements
        are generated from counterclockwise elements).

        Note:: : Since nodes may be defined anywhere in the model independently
        of this command, any orientation of the "symmetry" elements is
        possible. See also the ENSYM command for modifying existing elements.

        Note:: : The session editor file can be changed only by the session

        num
            Unique number assigned as each annotation is applied to a model.
            These numbers are applied sequentially, although when an annotation
            entity is deleted, its number is reassigned.

        xhot, yhot, zhot
            X, Y, Z coordinates for hot spot location.

        Notes
        -----
        Because 3-D annotation is applied in relation to the XYZ coordinates of
        the anchor, you can transform your model, and the annotation will
        maintain the spatial relationship with the model. This works within
        reason, and there are instances where changing the perspective or the
        size of the model will change the apparent relationship between the
        annotation and the model.

         The overall 3-D dimensions of your model are defined by a bounding
        box.  If portions of your model's bounding box lie outside of the
        visible area of your graphics window (if you are zoomed in on a
        specific area of your model), it can affect the placement of your 3-D
        annotations.  Zooming out will usually overcome this problem.

        3-D annotation is valid for the Cartesian (CSYS,0) coordinate system
        only. If you want to annotate a model you created in another coordinate
        system, use 2-D annotation (note that 2-D annotations do not remain
        anchored for dynamic rotations or transformations).

        When you apply user defined bitmaps, the size of the annotation can
        vary. Use the options menu of the 3-D annotation widget to adjust the
        size and placement of your bitmaps.

        You cannot use the “!” and “$” characters in ANSYS text annotation.

        The GUI generates this command during 3-D annotation operations and
        inserts the command into the log file (Jobname.LOG). You should NOT
        type this command directly during an ANSYS session (although the
        command can be included in an input file for batch input or for use
        with the /INPUT command).

            NEW - Specifies a new analysis (default). If NEW, the remaining fields on this
                  command are ignored.

            RESTART - Specifies a restart of a previous analysis. Valid for static, modal, and
                      transient (full or mode-superposition method) analyses.
                      For more information about restarting static and
                      transient analyses, see Multiframe Restart in the Basic
                      Analysis Guide. For more information on restarting a
                      modal analysis, see Modal Analysis Restart in the Basic
                      Analysis Guide.

            Multiframe restart is also valid for harmonic analysis, but is limited to 2-D magnetic analysis only. - A substructure analysis (backsubstitution method only) can be restarted for the
                              purpose of generating additional load vectors.
                              For more information, see the SEOPT command and
                              Applying Loads and Creating the Superelement
                              Matrices in the Substructuring Analysis Guide.

            VTREST - Specifies the restart of a previous VT Accelerator analysis. Valid only with
                     Antype = STATIC, HARMIC, or TRANS. For more information,
                     see VT Accelerator Re-run in the Basic Analysis Guide.

        ldstep
            Specifies the load step at which a multiframe restart begins.

        substep
            Specifies the substep at which a multiframe restart begins.

        action
            Specifies the manner of a multiframe restart.

            CONTINUE - The program continues the analysis based on the specified LDSTEP and SUBSTEP
                       (default). The current load step is continued. If the
                       end of the load step is encountered in the .Rnnn file, a
                       new load step is started. The program deletes all .Rnnn
                       files, or .Mnnn files for mode-superposition transient
                       analyses, beyond the point of restart and updates the
                       .LDHI file if a new load step is encountered.

            ENDSTEP - At restart, force the specified load step (LDSTEP) to end at the specified
                      substep (SUBSTEP), even though the end of the current
                      load step has not been reached. At the end of the
                      specified substep, all loadings are scaled to the level
                      of the current ending and stored in the .LDHI file. A run
                      following this ENDSTEP starts a new load step. This
                      capability allows you to change the load level in the
                      middle of a load step. The program updates the .LDHI file
                      and deletes all .Rnnn files, or .Mnnn files for mode-
                      superposition transient analyses, beyond the point of
                      ENDSTEP. The .Rnnn or .Mnnn file at the point of ENDSTEP
                      are rewritten to record the rescaled load level.

            RSTCREATE - At restart, retrieve information to be written to the results file for the
                        specified load step (LDSTEP) and substep (SUBSTEP). Be
                        sure to use   OUTRES to write the results to the
                        results file. This action does not affect the .LDHI or
                        .Rnnn files. Previous items stored in the results file
                        at and beyond the point of RSTCREATE are deleted. This
                        option cannot be used to restart a mode-superposition
                        transient analysis.

            PERTURB - At restart, a linear perturbation analysis (static, modal, buckling, or full
                      harmonic) is performed for the specified load step
                      (LDSTEP) and substep (SUBSTEP). This action does not
                      affect the .LDHI, .Rnnn, or .RST files.

        Notes
        -----
        If using the ANTYPE command to change the analysis type in the same
        SOLVE session, the program issues the following message: “Some analysis
        options have been reset to their defaults. Please verify current
        settings or respecify as required.” Typically, the program resets
        commands such as NLGEOM and EQSLV to their default values.

        The analysis type (Antype) cannot be changed if a restart is specified.
        Always save parameters before doing a restart. For more information on
        the different types of restart, see Restarting an Analysis in the Basic
        Analysis Guide.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        The ANSYS Professional - Nonlinear Structural (PRN) product supports
        the Antype = TRANS option for mode-superposition (TRNOPT,MSUP) analyses
        only.

        APDL Command: RESCONTROL

        Controls file writing for multiframe restarts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action
             Command action. Valid options are:

            DEFINE - Issuing the command specifies how frequently the .Xnnn restart files are
                     written for a load step (default).

            FILE_SUMMARY - Issuing the command prints the substep and load step information for all .Xnnn
                           files for the current jobname in the current
                           directory. If this option is specified, all other
                           arguments are ignored.

            STATUS - Issuing the command lists the current status in the tables of restart controls
                     specified previously by RESCONTROL. If this option is
                     specified, all other arguments are ignored.

            NORESTART - Issuing the command cleans up some of the restart files after a Distributed
                        ANSYS solution. The host process will not have the
                        following files in the working directory at the end of
                        the run: .ESAV, .OSAV, .Xnnn, .RDB,  .LDHI. The slave
                        processes will not have the following files in the
                        working directory at the end of the run: .ESAV, .OSAV,
                        .Xnnn, .RST (or .RTH, etc.). Some of the restart files
                        are never written, some are removed upon leaving /SOLU
                        (for example, upon FINISH), and some are removed upon
                        exiting the program.

            This option is useful for cleaning up files written by all of the Distributed ANSYS processes, particularly when you know that these restart files will not be needed later on. If this option is specified, all other arguments are ignored. - If this option is used in shared-memory parallel ANSYS, most of the restart
                              files in the working directory are removed. It
                              has the same effect as issuing RESCONTROL,,NONE.

            LINEAR - Issuing the command specifies the same actions as Action = DEFINE. However,
                     this option is intended for linear static applications.
                     For a linear static analysis, the restart capability is
                     normally not needed. However, it is typically needed when
                     a subsequent linear perturbation analysis is desired. By
                     default, none of the restart files are written for a
                     linear static analysis.

            DELETE - Delete the restart control specification corresponding to the Ldstep label on a
                     previous RESCONTROL,DEFINE command.

        ldstep
            Specifies how the .Xnnn files are written for the specified load
            steps. This option also affects how often the load history
            information is written to the .LDHI file.

            ALL - Write the .Xnnn files at the same substep Frequency for all load steps; write
                  the load history information to the .LDHI file for all load
                  steps.

            LAST - Write the .Xnnn files for the last load step only; write load history
                   information to the .LDHI file for the last load step only.
                   This option is the default for nonlinear static and full
                   transient analyses. The remaining arguments are ignored.

            N - Number that indicates how often the .Xnnn file is written.

             Input a positive number to write the .Xnnn files at the substep Frequency indicated only for load step N. Other load steps will be written at the default substep frequency or at a frequency defined by a previous RESCONTROL specification. Load history information is written to the .LDHI file only for load steps N. - Input a negative number (-N) to write the .Xnnn files for every Nth load step
                              at the specified substep Frequency. The load
                              history information is written to the .LDHI file
                              every Nth load step. This option is suitable for
                              restart applications in which more than a few
                              hundred load steps are required. Compared to the
                              ALL and positive N options, it can save disk
                              space since the .LDHI file is smaller and fewer
                              .Xnnn files are written.

            If Ldstep = -N, all other Ldstep options specified by RESCONTROL are ignored and the program follows the -N option (write load history information every Nth load step). If you want to change this pattern, issue RESCONTROL,DELETE, -N and then issue another RESCONTROL command with the desired Ldstep option. - NONE

            No multiframe restart files (.RDB [restart database file], .LDHI [load history file], .Xnnn) are created. This option is the default for mode-superposition analyses. The remaining arguments are ignored.  - For nonlinear static, linear static, and full transient analyses, this option
                              allows a restart to be done at the last or abort
                              point using the same procedure as in ANSYS 5.5 or
                              earlier (using the .EMAT, .ESAV or .OSAV, and .DB
                              files).

        frequency
            Frequency at which the .Xnnn files are written at the substep
            level.

            NONE - Do not write any .Xnnn files for this load step.

            LAST - Write the .Xnnn files for the last substep of the load step only (default for
                   nonlinear static and full transient analyses).

            N - If N is positive, write the .Xnnn file every Nth substep of a load step. If N
                is negative, write N equally spaced .Xnnn files within a load
                step.

            In nonlinear static and full transient analyses, negative N is valid only when AUTOTS,ON. - In mode-superposition analyses, negative N is always valid.

        maxfiles
            Maximum number of .Xnnn files to save for Ldstep.

            -1 - Overwrite existing .Xnnn files (default). The total maximum number of .Xnnn
                 files for one run is 999. If this number is reached before the
                 analysis is complete, the program will reset the .Xnnn file
                 numbering back to 1 and continue to write .Xnnn files; the
                 program keeps the newest 999 restart files and overwrites the
                 oldest restart files.

            0 - Do not overwrite any existing .Xnnn files. The total maximum number of .Xnnn
                files for one run is 999. If this number is reached before the
                analysis is complete, the analysis continues but no longer
                writes any .Xnnn files.

            N - The maximum number of .Xnnn files to keep for each load step. When N .Xnnn fi

        Writes a list of commands to a specified file at the same time that the

        Parameters
        ----------
        label
            Indicates how ANSYS is to interpret this /TEE command:

            Signals the beginning of the command text that is to be written to Fname. If Fname already exists, specifying NEW causes the contents of Fname to be overwritten. - Indicates that you want to append to Fname the command text that follows.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        You can use the /TEE command to record a macro to a specified file at
        the same time that the macro is being executed. It is similar to the
        Linux tee command.

        For more information about the /TEE command, see the Introducing APDL
        of the ANSYS Parametric Design Language Guide.

        The following example illustrates the use of the /TEE command. If you
        issue these commands:

        Parameters
        ----------
        reimky
            Real/Imaginary print key:

            ON - Print complex displacements as real and imaginary components (default).

            OFF - Print complex displacements as amplitude and phase angle (degrees).

        clust
            Cluster option (for HROPT,MSUP):

            OFF - Uniform spacing of frequency solutions (default).

            ON - Cluster frequency solutions about natural frequencies.

        mcont
            Mode contributions key (for HROPT,MSUP):

            OFF - No print of mode contributions at each frequency (default).

            ON - Print mode contributions at each frequency.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the harmonic analysis (ANTYPE,HARMIC) output options.  If
        used in SOLUTION, this command is valid only within the first load
        step. OUTPR,NSOL must be specified to print mode contributions at each
        frequency.

        This command is ignored if the HROPT command has been issued with
        Method = VT, VTPA, or VTRU. Displacements are not available at expanded
        frequencies with these solution methods.

        For cyclic symmetry mode-superposition harmonic solutions, the cluster
        option is not available.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        ----------
        fname
            Device name, file name, or keyword, as listed below:

            <device name> - Any valid graphics display device name (e.g., X11, 3-D etc.).  Defaults to X11
                            for most systems.  See Getting Started with
                            Graphics in the Basic Analysis Guide for details.
                            A device name must be defined before activating the
                            Graphical User Interface (GUI).  Once the GUI is
                            activated, the device name cannot be changed for
                            that session, except for switching between X11 and
                            X11C.

            <filename> - Name of graphics file to which graphics displays are to be diverted (248
                         characters maximum).  Should not be the same as a
                         valid device name or any other Fname option. Plots are
                         written to the file Filename.Ext (or just Filename.Ext
                         if Ext is left blank) in the working directory. This
                         file can be appended only during the same session;
                         reissuing the same file name in a new session will
                         overwrite existing file names from previous sessions.
                         Although multiple file names can be used within one
                         session, only the last file created or accessed will
                         be appended.  Issuing /SHOW, CLOSE, or starting a new
                         session will prevent access to any previously created
                         files.

            TERM - Graphics displays are switched back to the last-specified device name.

            CLOSE - This option purges the graphics file buffer. The CLOSE option should be issued
                    any time you are changing graphics devices or file output
                    types during a session. Graphics displays are switched back
                    to the last-specified device name, and any open graphics
                    files are closed. The CLOSE option is similar to the TERM
                    option, however, with the CLOSE option, another process,
                    such as the DISPLAY program, can access the data in the
                    graphics file. The CLOSE option causes graphics file
                    buffers to be flushed to the graphics file.

            FILE - Graphics displays are switched back to the last-specified file name.

            OFF - Graphics display requests are ignored.

            (blank) - If blank in interactive mode, graphics will be displayed on screen as requested
                      by display commands (no file written);  If blank in batch
                      mode, graphics data will be written to Jobname.GRPH.

            PSCR - Creates PostScript graphic files that are named Jobnamennn.eps, where nnn is a
                   numeric value that is incremented by one as each additional
                   file is created; that is, Jobname000.eps, Jobname001.eps,
                   Jobname002.eps, and so on .  (See the PSCR command for
                   options.)  Ignores the Ext and NCPL fields.

            HPGL - Creates Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language files that are named Jobnamennn.hpgl,
                   where nnn is a numeric value that is incremented by one as
                   each additional file is created; that is, Jobname000.hpgl,
                   Jobname001.hpgl, Jobname002.hpgl, and so on.  (See the HPGL
                   command for options.)  Ignores the Ext and NCPL fields.

            HPGL2 - Creates Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language files that are named Jobnamennn.hpgl,
                    where nn is a numeric value that is incremented by one as
                    each additional file is created; that is, Jobname000.hpgl,
                    Jobname001.hpgl, Jobname02.hpgl, and so on.  The HPGL2
                    files have enhanced color.  (See the HPGL command for
                    options.)  Ignores the Ext field.

            JPEG - Creates JPEG files that are named Jobnamennn.jpg, where nnn is a numeric value
                   that is incremented by one as each additional file is
                   created; that is, Jobname000.jpg, Jobname001.jpg,
                   Jobname002.jpg, and so on. Ignores the Ext field.

            TIFF - Creates tagged image format files that are named Jobnamennn.tif, where nnn is a
                   numeric value that is incremented by one as each additional
                   file is created; that is, Jobname000.tif, Jobname001.tif,
                   Jobname002.tif, and so on. This value for the Fname argument
                   ignores the Ext field. (See the TIFF command for options.)

            PNG - Creates PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files that are named Jobnamennn.png,
                  where nnn is a numeric value that is incremented by one as
                  each additional file is created; that is, Jobname000.png,
                  Jobname001.png, Jobname002.png, and so on. This value for the
                  Fname argument ignores the Ext field. (See the PNGR command
                  for options.)

            VRML - Creates Virtual Reality Meta Language files named Jobname000.wrl that can be
                   displayed on 3-D Internet web browsers.  Ignores the Ext and
                   NCPL fields.

        option
            Assign a file name extension or specify reverse video output:

            Ext -  File name extension (eight-character maximum).

            REV - Reverse background/image (black/white) colors. Valid with Fname = PNG
                  (recommended), JPEG, PSCR, TIFF, and HPGL. This option is
                  ignored if a previously specified color map table  (/CMAP or
                  /RGB) is in effect.

        vect
            Specifies raster or vector display mode.  This affects area,
            volume, and element displays, as well as geometric results displays
            such as contour plots.  See the /DEVICE command for an alternate
            way to toggle between raster and vector mode.  Changing VECT also
            resets the /TYPE command to its default.

            0 - Raster display (color filled entities; default)

            1 - Vector display (outlined entities; i.e., "wireframe")

        ncpl
            Sets the number of color planes (4 to 8).  Default is device-
            dependent.  NCPL is not supported by all graphics devices.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the device to be used for graphics displays, and specifies
        other graphics display parameters.  Display may be shown at the time of
        generation (for interactive runs at a graphics display terminal) or
        diverted to a file for later processing with the DISPLAY program.
        Issue /PSTATUS for display status.

        Batch runs do not have access to the fonts available on your system.

        Interactive displays default to eight color planes (NCPL = 8) for most
        monitors, while graph file output defaults to eight color planes for
        VRML output, and four color planes for PSCR, HPGL, HPGL2, JPEG, PNG,
        TIFF and FILE33.

            ignored if NL1 = ALL or NDIV > 2.  If PDIV already exists and lies
            on line NL1, divide line at PDIV (RATIO must also be 0.0).  If PDIV
            already exists and does not lie on line NL1, PDIV is projected and
            moved to the nearest point on line NL1 (if possible). PDIV cannot
            be attached to another line, area, or volume.

        ndiv

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Type of FFT transformation:

            Forward FFT computation (default). - Backward FFT computation.

        inputdata
            Name of matrix or vector for which the FFT will be computed. This
            can be a dense matrix (created by the *DMAT command) or a vector
            (created by the *VEC command). Data can be real or complex values.
            There is no default value for this argument.

        outputdata
            Name of matrix or vector where the FFT results will be stored. The
            type of this argument must be consistent with InputData (see table
            below). There is no default value for this argument.

        dim1
            The number of terms to consider for a vector, or the number of rows
            for a matrix. Defaults to the whole input vector or all the rows of
            the matrix.

        dim2
            The number of columns to consider for a matrix. Defaults to all the

        resultformat
            Specifies the result format:

            Returns the full result. That is, the result matches the dimension specified on this command (DIM1, DIM2). - Returns partial results. For real input data, there is a symmetry in the

        action
            The 2-D to 3-D action to perform:

            START - Start the analysis process by rebuilding the 2-D analysis database (.db) based
                    on the specified load step and substep information, and
                    update nodes to their deformed positions in the 2-D mesh.

            FINISH - Maps solution variables from the 2-D mesh to the extruded 3-D mesh.

        ldstep
            The load step number at which 2-D to 3-D analysis should occur. The
            default value is the highest load step number found in the
            Jobname.Rnnn files (for the current jobname and in the current
            directory).

        sbstep
            The substep number of the specified load step (LDSTEP) at which the
            2-D to 3-D analysis should occur. The default value is the highest
            substep number found in the specified load step in the Jobname.Rnnn

        option
            Mapping option:

            (Blank) - Transfer and map all applied boundary conditions, nodal temperatures, loads,
                      and surface pressures from the 2-D mesh to the extruded
                      3-D mesh. This behavior is the default.

            NOBC - No applied boundary conditions or loads are transferred from the 2-D mesh to
                   the extruded 3-D mesh. Nodal temperatures (defined via the
                   BF,TEMP command) are transferred.

            DIST - Value is the absolute distance between KP1 and KPNEW (valid only if current
                   coordinate system is Cartesian).

        value
            Location of new keypoint, as defined by Type (defaults to 0.5).  If
            VALUE is a ratio (Type = RATIO) and is less than 0 or greater than
            1, the keypoint is created on the extended line.  Similarly, if
            VALUE is a distance (Type = DIST) and is less than 0 or greater
            than the distance between KP1 and KP2, the keypoint is created on
            the extended line.

        Notes
        -----
        Placement of the new keypoint depends on the currently active
        coordinate system [CSYS].  If the coordinate system is Cartesian, the
        keypoint will lie on a straight line between KP1 and KP2.  If the
        system is not Cartesian (e.g., cylindrical, spherical, etc.), the
        keypoint will be located as if on a line (which may not be straight)
        created in the current coordinate system between KP1 and KP2.  Note
        that solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is not recommended.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action
            One of the following command operations:

            DEFINE - Specify the degrees of freedom (DOFs). This value is the default.

            LIST - List all previously specified DOFs.

            DELETE -  Delete all previously specified DOFs.

        dof1, dof2, dof3, . . . , dof10
            The list of DOFs.

        Notes
        -----
        The USRDOF command specifies the degrees of freedom for the user-
        defined element USER300.

        Although you can intersperse other commands as necessary for your
        analysis, issue the USRDOF command as part of the following general
        sequence of commands:

        Issue the ET command for element USER300, followed by the related TYPE
        command.

        Issue both the USRELEM and USRDOF commands (in either order).

        Define your element using USER300.

        The DOF list (DOF1 through DOF10) can consist of up to 10 DOFs. Use any
        valid and appropriate DOF (such as UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ, AX,
        AY, AZ, VX, VY, VZ, PRES, WARP, TEMP, VOLT, MAG, EMF, and CURR).

        You can specify a maximum of 10 DOFs per USRDOF command. To define
        additional DOFs, issue the command again.

        The maximum number of DOFs for a user-defined element--the number of
        nodes times the number of DOFs per node--cannot exceed 480.

        APDL Command: LDREAD

        Reads results from the results file and applies them as loads.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Valid load label:

            TEMP - Temperatures from a thermal analysis are applied as body force nodal loads (BF)
                   in a structural analysis, an explicit dynamic analysis, or
                   other type of analysis.

            If the thermal analysis uses SHELL131 or SHELL132, temperatures are applied as body force element loads (BFE). In most cases, only the top and bottom temperatures from SHELL131 and SHELL132 are used by the structural shell elements; any interior temperatures are ignored.  - All temperatures are used for SHELL181 using section input, and SHELL281 using
                              section input; for these elements, therefore, the
                              number of temperature points at a node generated
                              in the thermal model must match the number of
                              temperature points at a node needed by the
                              structural model.

            When using SHELL131 or SHELL132 information for the LDREAD operation, all element types should specify the same set of thermal degrees of freedom. - When used in conjunction with KIMG=1 and KIMG=2, temperatures can be applied to
                              a subsequent thermal analysis as nodal loads (D)
                              or initial conditions (IC), respectively.

            FORC - Forces from an electromagnetic analysis are applied as force loads (F) in a
                   structural analysis. LDREAD,FORC reads coupling forces. See
                   the discussion on force computation in the Low-Frequency
                   Electromagnetic Analysis Guide.

              For a full harmonic magnetic analysis, FORC represents the time-averaged force (use in conjunction with KIMG = 2).  Values are in the nodal coordinate system for the force loads (F). - HGEN

            Heat generations from an electromagnetic analysis are applied as body force loads (BFE) in a thermal analysis.  For a full harmonic analysis, HGEN represents the time-averaged heat generation load (use in conjunction with KIMG = 2). - JS

            Source current density from a current-conduction analysis are applied as body force loads (BFE).  Values are in the global Cartesian coordinate system. - EF

            Electric field element centroid values from an electrostatic analysis are applied as body force loads (BFE) in a magnetic analysis. Values are in the global Cartesian coordinate system. - REAC

            Reaction loads from any analysis are applied as force loads (F) in any analysis.  Values are in the nodal coordinate system. - CONC

        lstep
            Load step number of the data set to be read.  Defaults to 1.  If
            LAST, ignore SBSTEP and TIME and read the last data set.

        sbstep
            Substep number (within LSTEP).  If zero (or blank), LSTEP
            represents the last substep of the load step.

        time
            Time-point identifying the data set to be read.  Used only if both
            LSTEP and SBSTEP are zero (or blank).  If TIME is between two
            solution time points on the results file, a linear interpolation is
            done between the two data sets.  If TIME is beyond the last time
            point on the file, use the last time point.

        kimg
            When used with results from harmonic analyses (ANTYPE,HARMIC) KIMG
            establishes which set of data to read:

            0 - Read the real part of the solution.  Valid also for Lab = EHFLU to read in
                time-average heat flux.

            1 - Read the imaginary part of the solution.

            2 - Calculate and read the time-average part. Meaningful for Lab = HGEN or FORC.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        The LDREAD command reads results data from the results file and applies
        them as loads.

        The command can also apply results from an analysis defined with one
        physics environment as loads on a second analysis using a different
        physics environment. Results values are applied as loads for field-
        coupling effects (for example, output temperatures from a thermal
        analysis as input to a structural analysis).

        The command works based on the assumption that the meshes have not
        changed.

        Nodal loads are applied only to selected nodes. Element loads are
        applied only to selected elements. Element surface loads are applied
        only to selected elements where all face nodes for that surface are
        selected.

        To assure proper distribution of the surface loads, select only the
        nodes on the element face where the surface load is to be applied.

        Scaling and accumulation specifications are applied as the loads are
        read via the following commands:

        BFCUM for body force loads. (Heat-generation loads are not
        accumulated.)

            Default for these coefficients is zero.

        Notes

        This command specifies velocity coefficients to analyze shock

        Notes
        -----
        When a structure is rotating and the Coriolis or gyroscopic effect is
        taken into account (CORIOLIS), nodes lying on the rotation axis
        generally exhibit an elliptical orbital motion. The PLORB command
        displays the orbit of each rotating node as well as the deformed shape
        at time t = 0 (the real part of the solution).

        To print the characteristics of the orbital path traversed by each
        node, issue the PRORB command.

        The PLORB command is valid for line elements (such as BEAM188, BEAM189,
        PIPE288, and PIPE289).

        Your model must also involve a rotational velocity (OMEGA or CMOMEGA)
        with Coriolis enabled in a stationary reference frame
        (CORIOLIS,,,,RefFrame = ON).

        A SET command should be issued after PLORB to ensure proper output for
        subsequent postprocessing commands.

        The coordinate system for displaying nodal results must be global
        Cartesian (RSYS,KCN = 0).

        APDL Command: AREFINE

        Refines the mesh around specified areas.

        Parameters
        ----------
        na1, na2, ninc
            Areas (NA1 to NA2 in increments of NINC) around which the mesh is
            to be refined.  NA2 defaults to NA1, and NINC defaults to 1.  If
            NA1 = ALL, NA2 and NINC are ignored and all selected areas are used
            for refinement.  If NA1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A
            component name may also be substituted for NA1 (NA2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of the number of elements outward
            from the indicated areas (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        AREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified areas.  By
        default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements with
        1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        AREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified areas.  Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified areas, but are not tetrahedra (for example,
        hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements.  This applies
        to nodes and elements anywhere in the model, not just in the region
        where you want to request mesh refinement.  See Revising Your Model in
        the Modeling and Meshing Guide for additional restrictions on mesh
        refinement.

        This command is also valid for rezoning.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cputime
            CPU time limit (in seconds) for the current phase of the analysis
            (defaults to 0). If CPUTIME = 0, no CPU time limit is set. CPUTIME
            values below 0 are not allowed.

            NODE - Nodal excitation.

        parcor
            Label defining excitation type (applies only to SPOPT,PSD
            analysis).  Used only when partially correlated excitation is due
            to wave propagation or spatial correlation.  Defaults to partially
            correlated excitation as defined by COVAL and QDVAL commands.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Type of entity used to define the circular arc.  The meaning of

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc
            Location within shell element (or layer) to obtain stress results:

            TOP - Top of shell element (or layer) (default).

            MID - Middle of shell element (or layer). The default method averages the TOP and BOT

                  SHELL181, SHELL208, SHELL209, and ELBOW290 uses MID results
                  obtained directly from the results file.

            BOT - Bottom of shell element (or layer).

        Notes
        -----
        Selects the location within a shell element (or a shell layer) for
        results output (nodal stresses, strains, etc.).  Applies to POST1
        selects, sorts, and output [NSEL, NSORT, PRNSOL, PLNSOL, PRPATH,
        PLPATH, etc.], and is used for storage with the POST26 ESOL command.
        For example, SHELL,TOP causes item S of the POST1 PRNSOL command or the
        POST26 ESOL command to be the stresses at the top of the shell
        elements.  For layered shell elements, use the LAYER (POST1) or
        LAYERP26 (POST26) command to select the layer. The SHELL command does
        not apply to the layered thermal shell elements, SHELL131 and SHELL132.

        For PowerGraphics [/GRAPHICS,POWER], the SHELL,MID command affects both
        the printed output and the displayed results, while the SHELL (TOP or
        BOT) command prints and displays both the top and bottom layers
        simultaneously. Note that /CYCEXPAND,ON automatically turns on
        PowerGraphics; however, for cyclic mode-superposition harmonic
        postprocessing (CYCFILES), the SHELL command prints and displays only
        the requested layer.

        In POST26, the ESOL data stored is based on the active SHELL
        specification at the time the data is stored. To store data at various
        specifications (for example, stresses at the top and bottom locations),
        issue a STORE command before each new specification.

        Notes
        -----
        Generates areas (and their corresponding keypoints and lines) by
        sweeping a given line pattern along a characteristic drag path.  If the
        drag path consists of multiple lines, the drag direction is determined
        by the sequence in which the path lines are input (NLP1, NLP2, etc.).
        If the drag path is a single line (NLP1), the drag direction is  from
        the keypoint on the drag line that is closest to the first keypoint of
        the given line pattern to the other end of the drag line.

        The magnitude of the vector between the keypoints of the given pattern
        and the first path keypoint remains constant for all generated keypoint
        patterns and the path keypoints.  The direction of the vector relative
        to the path slope also remains constant so that patterns may be swept
        around curves.

        Keypoint, line, and area numbers are automatically assigned (beginning
        with the lowest available values [NUMSTR]).  Adjacent lines use a
        common keypoint.  Adjacent areas use a common line.  For best results,
        the entities to be dragged should be orthogonal to the start of the
        drag path.  Drag operations that produce an error message may create
        some of the desired entities prior to terminating.

        Reads results for the selected portions of the model.

        Parameters

        lstep
            Load step number of the data set to be read (defaults to 1):

            N - Read load step N.

            FIRST - Read the first data set (SBSTEP and TIME are ignored).

            LAST - Read the last data set (SBSTEP and TIME are ignored).

            NEXT - Read the next data set (SBSTEP and TIME are ignored).  If at the last data set,
                   the first data set will be read as the next.

            NEAR - Read the data set nearest to TIME (SBSTEP is ignored).  If TIME is blank, read
                   the first data set.

            LIST - Scan the results file and list a summary of each load step.  (FACT, KIMG, TIME
                   and ANGLE are ignored.)

        sbstep
            Substep number (within Lstep).   For the buckling (ANTYPE,BUCKLE)
            analysis or the modal (ANTYPE,MODAL) analysis, the substep
            corresponds to the mode number.  Defaults to last substep of load
            step (except for ANTYPE,BUCKLE or MODAL).  If Lstep = LIST, SBSTEP
            = 0 or 1 lists the basic step information, whereas SBSTEP = 2 also
            lists the load step title, and labels imaginary data sets if they
            exist.

        fact
            Scale factor applied to data read from the file.  If zero (or
            blank), a value of 1.0 is used.  Harmonic velocities or
            accelerations may be calculated from the displacement results from
            a modal (ANTYPE,MODAL) or harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC) analyses.  If
            FACT = VELO, the harmonic velocities (v) are calculated from the
            displacements (d) at a particular frequency (f) according to the
            relationship v = 2 πfd.  Similarly, if FACT = ACEL, the harmonic
            accelerations (a) are calculated as a = (2 πf)2d.

        kimg
            Used only with results from complex analyses:

            0 - Store real part of complex solution

            1 - Store imaginary part.

        time
            Time-point identifying the data set to be read.  For harmonic
            analyses, time corresponds to the frequency.  For the buckling
            analysis, time corresponds to the load factor.  Used only in the
            following cases:  If Lstep is NEAR, read the data set nearest to
            TIME.   If both Lstep and SBSTEP are zero (or blank), read data set
            at time = TIME.  If TIME is between two solution time points on the
            results file, a linear interpolation is done between the two data
            sets.  Solution items not written to the results file [OUTRES] for
            either data set will result in a null item after data set
            interpolation.  If TIME is beyond the last time point on the file,
            use the last time point.

        angle
            Circumferential location (0.0 to 360°).  Defines the
            circumferential location for the harmonic calculations used when

            See the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for details.  Note that

        parr
            The name of the input vector array parameter.  See *SET for name
            restrictions.  The parameter must exist as a dimensioned array
            [*DIM] with data input.

        entity
            Entity keyword.  Valid keywords are shown for Entity = in the table
            below.

        entnum
            The number of the entity (as shown for ENTNUM= in the table below).

        item1
            The name of a particular item for the given entity.  Valid items
            are as shown in the Item1 columns of the table below.

        it1num

            IT1NUM values are as shown in the IT1NUM columns of the table
            below.  Some Item1 labels do not require an IT1NUM value.

        item2, it2num
            A second set of item labels and numbers to further qualify the item
            for which data is to be stored.  Most items do not require this
            level of information.

        kloop
            Field to be looped on:

            Loop on the ENTNUM field (default). - Loop on the Item1 field.

            Loop on the IT1NUM field.  Successive items are as shown with IT1NUM. - Loop on the Item2 field.

        The *VPUT command is not supported for PowerGraphics displays.
        Inconsistent results may be obtained if this command is not used in
        /GRAPHICS, FULL.

        Plot and print operations entered via the GUI (Utility Menu> Pltcrtls,
        Utility Menu> Plot) incorporate the AVPRIN command. This means that the
        principal and equivalent values are recalculated. If you use *VPUT to
        put data back into the database, issue the plot commands from the
        command line to preserve your data.

        This operation is basically the inverse of the *VGET operation.  Vector
        items are put directly (without any coordinate system transformation)
        into the ANSYS database.  Items can only replace existing items of the
        database and not create new items.  Degree of freedom results that are
        replaced in the database are available for all subsequent
        postprocessing operations.  Other results are changed temporarily and
        are available mainly for the immediately following print and display
        operations.  The vector specification *VCUM does not apply to this
        command.  The valid labels for the location fields (Entity, ENTNUM,
        Item1, and IT1NUM) are listed below.  Item2 and IT2NUM are not
        currently used.  Not all items from the *VGET list are allowed on *VPUT

        inconsistent.

        APDL Command: DSPOPTION

         Sets memory option for the distributed sparse solver.

        Parameters
        ----------
        reord_option
            Reordering option:

            DEFAULT - Use the default reordering scheme.

            SEQORDER - Use a sequential equation reordering scheme within the distributed sparse
                       solver. Relative to PARORDER, this option typically
                       results in longer equation ordering times and therefore
                       longer overall solver times. Occasionally, however, this
                       option will produce better quality orderings which
                       decrease the matrix factorization times and improve
                       overall solver performance.

            PARORDER - Use a parallel equation reordering scheme within the distributed sparse solver.
                       Relative to SEQORDER, this option typically results in
                       shorter equation ordering times and therefore shorter
                       overall solver times. Occasionally, however, this option
                       will produce lower quality orderings which increase the
                       matrix factorization times and degrade overall solver
                       performance.

        memory_option
            Memory allocation option:

            DEFAULT - Use the default memory allocation strategy for the distributed sparse solver.
                      The default strategy attempts to run in the INCORE memory
                      mode. If there is not enough physical memory available
                      when the solver starts to run in the INCORE memory mode,
                      the solver will then attempt to run in the OUTOFCORE
                      memory mode.

            INCORE -  Use a memory allocation strategy in the distributed sparse solver that will
                     attempt to obtain enough memory to run with the entire
                     factorized matrix in memory. This option uses the most
                     amount of memory and should avoid doing any I/O. By
                     avoiding I/O, this option achieves optimal solver
                     performance. However, a significant amount of memory is
                     required to run in this mode, and it is only recommended
                     on machines with a large amount of memory. If the
                     allocation for in-core memory fails, the solver will
                     automatically revert to out-of-core memory mode.

            OUTOFCORE - Use a memory allocation strategy in the distributed sparse solver that will
                        attempt to allocate only enough work space to factor
                        each individual frontal matrix in memory, but will
                        share the entire factorized matrix on disk. Typically,
                        this memory mode results in poor performance due to the
                        potential bottleneck caused by the I/O to the various
                        files written by the solver.

            FORCE - This option, when used in conjunction with the Memory_Size option, allows you
                    to force the distributed sparse solver to run with a
                    specific amount of memory. This option is only recommended
                    for the advanced user who understands distributed sparse
                    solver memory requirements for the problem being solved,
                    understands the physical memory on the system, and wants to
                    control the distributed sparse solver memory usage.

        memory_size
            Initial memory size allocation for the sparse solver in MB. The
            Memory_Size setting should always be well within the physical
            memory available, but not so small as to cause the distributed
            sparse solver to run out of memory. Warnings and/or errors from the
            distributed sparse solver will appear if this value is set too low.
            If the FORCE memory option is used, this value is the amount of
            memory allocated for the entire duration of the distributed sparse
            solver solution.

        --, --
            Unused fields

        solve_info
            Solver output option:

            OFF - Turns off additional output printing from the distributed sparse solver
                  (default).

            PERFORMANCE - Turns on additional output printing from the distributed sparse solver,
                          including a performance summary and a summary of file
                          I/O for the distributed sparse solver. Information on
                          memory usage during assembly of the global matrix
                          (that is, creation of the Jobname.FULL file) is also
                          printed with this option.

        Notes
        -----
        This command controls options related to the distributed sparse solver
        in all analysis types where the distributed sparse solver can be used.

        The amount of memory required for the distributed sparse solver is
        unknown until the matrix structure is preprocessed, including equation
        reordering. The amount of memory allocated for the distributed sparse
        solver is then dynamically adjusted to supply the solver what it needs
        to compute the solution.

        If you have a large memory system, you may want to try selecting the
        INCORE memory mode for larger jobs to improve performance. Also, when
        running the distributed sparse solver with many processors on the same
        machine or on a machine with very slow I/O performance (e.g., slow hard
        drive speed), you may want to try using the INCORE memory mode to
        achieve better performance. However, doing so may require much more
        memory compared to running in the OUTOFCORE memory mode.

        Running with the INCORE memory mode is best for jobs which comfortably
        fit within the limits of the physical memory on a given system. If the
        distributed sparse solver workspace exceeds physical memory size, the
        system will be forced to use virtual memory (or the system page/swap
        file). In this case, it is typically more efficient to run with the
        OUTOFCORE memory mode.

        -----
        Use of the AGLUE command generates new areas by "gluing" input areas.
        The glue operation redefines the input areas so that they share lines
        along their common boundaries.  The new areas encompass the same
        geometry as the original areas.  This operation is only valid if the
        intersection of the input areas are lines along the boundaries of those
        areas.  See the Modeling and Meshing Guide for an illustration.  See

        conditions assigned to the original entities will not be transferred to

        Notes
        -----
        FMAGBC invokes a predefined ANSYS macro to apply Maxwell and virtual
        work force and torque boundary conditions to an element component.
        These boundary conditions are used for subsequent force and torque
        calculations during solution.  Magnetic virtual displacements (MVDI =
        1) are applied to nodes of elements in the components, and  Maxwell
        surface flags (MXWF) are applied to air elements adjoining the element
        components.  Incorrect force and torque calculations will occur for
        components sharing adjacent air elements.   Companion macros FMAGSUM
        and TORQSUM can be used in POST1 to summarize the force and torque
        calculations, respectively.  Torque calculations are valid for 2-D
        planar analysis only.  For 2-D harmonic analysis, force and torque
        represent time-average values.

         If using elements PLANE121, SOLID122, SOLID123, PLANE233, SOLID236 and
        SOLID237 (static analyses only), use EMFT to summarize electromagnetic
        force and torque. If you do use FMAGSUM, you do not need to first set
        either the Maxwell or the virtual work force flags via FMAGBC.

        rad
            Radius of the circular path.  The nodes for the path are created at
            this radius.

        numn
            Number of nodes to be created for the circular path.  The greater
            the number of nodes, the higher the accuracy of the torque
            evaluation.  Defaults to 18.

        lcsys

        Notes
        -----
        TORQC2D invokes an ANSYS macro which calculates the mechanical torque
        on a body using a circular path.  It is used for a circular or
        cylindrical body such as a rotor in an electric machine.  The body must
        be centered about the global origin and must be surrounded by air
        elements.  The air elements surrounding the path at radius RAD must be
        selected, and elements with a high-permeability material should be
        unselected prior to using the macro.  The macro is valid for 2-D planar
        analyses only.  For a harmonic analysis, the macro calculates the time-
        average torque.  Radial symmetry models are allowed, i.e., the model
        need not be a full 360° model.

        The calculated torque is stored in the parameter TORQUE.  If the model
        is not a full 360° model, TORQUE should be multiplied by the
        appropriate factor (such as 4.0 for a 90° sector) to obtain the total
        torque.  A node plot showing the path is produced in interactive mode.

        The torque is calculated via a circular path integral of the Maxwell
        stress tensor.  The circular path and the nodes for the path are
        created by the macro at the specified radius RAD.  Path operations are
        used for the calculation, and all path items are cleared upon
        completion.  See the TORQ2D command for torque calculation based on an
        arbitrary, non-circular path.

        cm_name

        x1, y1, z1
            If the X2, Y2, Z2 fields are defined, X1, Y1, and Z1 define the

            The coordinates of the end point of the rotational axis vector.

        The CMROTATE command specifies the rotational motion velocity
        components ROTATX, ROTATY, and ROTATZ of an element component CM_Name
        about a user-defined rotational axis. The rotational axis can be
        defined either as a vector passing through a single point or a vector
        connecting two points. CMROTATE can be used in static analyses
        (ANTYPE,STATIC) and modal analyses (ANTYPE,MODAL).

        This command sets the constant rotational velocity on the nodes of the
        specified element component, despite any deformation at the nodes. This
        feature is primarily used for generating sliding contact at frictional
        contact interfaces in a brake squeal analysis. This type of analysis

        the rotating disk. The applicable contact elements, therefore, are
        CONTA173, CONTA174, and CONTA175.

        A brake squeal analysis generally involves a linear perturbation modal
        analysis subsequent to a large-deformation static analysis with the
        Newton-Raphson option set as NROPT,UNSYM. Therefore, CMROTATE is not

        Notes
        -----
        You can use the EDCMORE command to specify two additional contact
        parameters (SFS and SFM) for a specific contact definition. These
        parameters will apply only to the contact entity number entered on the
        NUM field. Use the EDCLIST command to obtain a list of contact
        definitions and their corresponding contact entity numbers. The listing
        produced by EDCLIST will include any contact parameters specified with
        the EDCMORE command.

        When you use the EDDC command to delete a contact definition, any
        parameters you specified with EDCMORE for that contact definition will
        also be deleted. To delete only the parameters specified by EDCMORE for
        a given contact definition, use the command EDCMORE,DELE,NUM.

        Note:: : When you delete a contact definition with the EDDC command,
        the contact entity numbers will be renumbered for the remaining contact
        definitions. Therefore, you should always issue EDCLIST to obtain a
        current list of contact entity numbers before adding or deleting
        contact parameters with the EDCMORE command.

        Notes
        -----
        This command generates the radiosity surface elements based on the
        RSYMM and RDEC parameters and stores them in the database. It works
        only on the faces of selected underlying elements that have RDSF flags
        on them and all corner nodes selected. You can issue multiple RSURF
        commands to build the radiosity model. However, all RSURF commands must
        be issued after issuing the RSYMM, and after the model is complete
        (i.e., after all meshing operations are complete).

        If you do issue multiple RSURF commands for different regions, you must
        first mesh the different regions, and then generate the radiosity
        surface elements on each meshed region individually. Use RSURF,,,ETNUM
        to assign a separate element type number to each region. This procedure
        allow you to identify the individual regions later in the multi-field
        analysis.

        If the underlying solid elements are higher order, the radiosity
        surface elements are always lower order (4- or 3-node in 3-D or 2-node
        in 2-D). Decimation will always occur before any symmetry operations.

        For 2-D axisymmetric YR models, the newly-generated nodes can have only
        positive Y coordinates.

        If you have already issued RSURF for a surface and you issue RSURF
        again, the program creates a new set of radiosity surface elements and
        nodes over the existing set, resulting in an erroneous solution.

            OFF - Do not check.

        Notes
        -----
        The CMSFILE command specifies the list of component mode synthesis
        (CMS) results files to include when plotting the mode shape of an
        assembly.

        During postprocessing (/POST1) of a CMS analysis, issue the CMSFILE
        command to point to component results files of interest. (You can issue
        the command as often as needed to include all or some of the component
        results files.) Issue the SET command to acquire the frequencies and
        mode shapes from substeps for all specified results files. Execute a
        plot (PLNSOL) or print (PRNSOL) operation to display the mode shape of
        the entire assembly.

        When you specify a results file to add to the plot list, the default
        behavior of the command (CmsKey = ON) is to first verify that the file
        is from a CMS analysis and that the frequencies of the result sets on
        the file match the frequencies on the first file in the list. If CmsKey
        = OFF, you can add any .rst file to the list of files to plot, even if
        the file was not expanded via a CMS expansion pass.

        If CmsKey = ON (default), output from the command appears as: ADD CMS
        FILE = filename.rst. : If CmsKey = OFF, output from the command appears
        as: ADD FILE = filename.rst.

        If Option = DELETE or CLEAR, you must clear the database (/CLEAR), then
        re-enter the postprocessor (/POST1) and issue a SET command for the
        change to take effect on subsequent plots.

        Clearing the database does not clear the list of files specified via

        rlab
            Result set label. Identifies the result set to be used for
            postprocessing. A result set label can be the solution set label
            you defined in a PDEXE command (if you are directly postprocessing
            Monte Carlo Simulation results), or the response surface set label
            defined in an RSFIT command (for Response Surface Analyses).

        relation
            Relation label for the relation between probabilistic design
            parameter Name and the limit value LIMIT:

            LT - Less than (default).

            GT - Greater than.

        limit
            Limit value.

        --
            Unused field.

        conf
            Confidence level. The confidence level is used to print the
            confidence bounds on the probability. The value for the confidence
            level must be between 0.0 and 1.0 and it defaults to 0.95 (95%).
            Printing of confidence bound is suppressed for CONF  0.5. This
            parameter is ignored for response surface methods results
            postprocessing.

        Notes
        -----
        Prints the probability that the probabilistic design input or output
        variable denoted with Name is smaller or larger than a certain limit
        value.

        If Rlab is left blank, then the result set label is inherited from the
        last PDEXE command (Slab), RSFIT command (RSlab), or the most recently
        used PDS postprocessing command where a result set label was explicitly
        specified.

        Use the relation label Relation to specify if you want to print a
        traditional probability value (LT) or the exceedence probability (GT).
        The LIMIT directly specifies at which value of Name (the design
        parameter) the probability should be evaluated. If LIMIT is between two
        sample values of Name the resulting probability is linearly
        interpolated between the sample values. If LIMIT is smaller than all
        sample values of Name the probability is 0.0 for Relation = LT and 1.0
        for Relation = GT. If LIMIT is greater than all sample values for Name
        the probability is 1.0 for Relation = LT and 0.0 for Relation = GT.

        The confidence level is a probability expressing the confidence that
        the value for the requested probability is in fact between the
        confidence bounds. The larger the confidence level, the wider the
        confidence bounds. Printing the confidence bounds only makes sense for
        postprocessing Monte Carlo simulation results, where the confidence
        bounds represent the accuracy of the results. With increasing sample
        sizes, the width of the confidence bounds gets smaller for the same
        confidence level. For response surface analysis methods, the number of
        simulations done on the response surface is usually very large;
        therefore, the accuracy of the results is determined by the response
        surface fit and not by the confidence level.

            Significance level. The value for the significance level must be

        Evaluation of the probabilistic sensitivities is based on the

        Corr option. For all sensitivity values, the probabilistic design tool
        evaluates the probability that the sensitivity can be neglected, based
        on statistical test theory. If this probability exceeds the
        significance level as specified by the SLEVEL parameter, the
        sensitivity value should be regarded as negligible or insignificant.
        The higher the significance level (SLEVEL) the more sensitivities are
        considered as significant. The sensitivity plot includes the
        significant sensitivities only and lists the insignificant ones

                              at earliest "clean exit" point.  Also writes the
                              message to the errors file, Jobname.ERR.

            Writes the message with a "FATAL ERROR" heading and causes run termination immediately.  Also writes the message to the errors file, Jobname.ERR. - Writes the message with a "NOTE" heading and displays it in the message dialog
                              box.  This option is most useful in GUI mode.

        val1, val2, val3, . . . , val8
            Numeric or alphanumeric character values to be included in message.
            Values may be the results of parameter evaluations.  All numeric
            values are assumed to be double precision. The FORTRAN nearest
            integer (NINT) function is used to form integers for the %I
            specifier.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows writing an output message via the ANSYS message subroutine.
        Also allows run termination control.  This command is used only when
        contained in a prepared file read into the ANSYS program (i.e.,
        *USE,/INPUT, etc.).  A message format must immediately follow the *MSG
        command (on a separate line, without parentheses, as described below).

        The message format may be up to 80 characters long, consisting of text
        strings and predefined "data descriptors" between the strings where
        numeric or alphanumeric character data are to be inserted.  The normal
        descriptors are %I for integer data, %G for double precision data, %C
        for alphanumeric character data, and %/ for a line break.  The
        corresponding FORTRAN data descriptors are I9, 1PG16.9 and A8,
        respectively.  Each descriptor must be preceded by a blank.  There must
        be one data descriptor for each specified value (8 maximum) in the
        order of the specified values.

        Enhanced descriptions may also be used:

        Do not begin *MSG format lines with *IF, *ELSE , *ELSEIF , or *ENDIF .
        If the last nonblank character of the message format is an ampersand
        (&), a second line will also be read as a continuation of the format.
        Up to nine continuations (ten total lines) may be read.  If normal
        descriptions are used, then consecutive blanks are condensed into one
        blank upon output, and a period is appended.  Up to ten lines of output
        of 72 characters each may be produced (using the %/ descriptor).  Two
        examples follow.

        Here is an example of the *MSG command and a format to print a message
        with two integer values and one real value:

        The output line is:

        Perform the harmonic ocean wave procedure (HOWP).

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Specifies how to include ocean wave information in a harmonic
            analysis:

            HARMONIC - Performs a harmonic analysis using both real and imaginary load vectors
                       calculated via the harmonic ocean wave procedure (HOWP).
                       This behavior is the default. This option performs a
                       harmonic analysis running at a frequency determined by
                       the wave period (specified via OCTABLE command input).

            STATIC - Performs a static analysis using both real and imaginary load vectors
                     (calculated via HOWP). This option works by performing a
                     harmonic analysis running at a frequency of 0.0.

            OFF - Deactivates a previously activated HOWP and performs a standard harmonic
                  analysis.

        nphase
            Positive number specifying the number of phases to calculate
            forces. This value must be at least 8. The default value is 20.

        Notes
        -----
        The HROCEAN command applies ocean wave information (obtained via the
        OCDATA and OCTABLE commands) in a harmonic analysis (ANTYPE,HARMIC) as
        real and imaginary forces.

        You can apply only one ocean load at a time.

        The applied frequency in the harmonic (Type = HARMONIC) analysis is
        based on the wave period input on the OCTABLE command (and not on
        HARFRQ command input, which cannot be used). Phase-shift input on the
        OCTABLE command is ignored.

        HOWP does not generate a damping matrix. If you require a damping
        matrix, you must add it separately.

        The command applies to regular wave types only (Airy with one wave
        component, Wheeler with one wave component, Stokes, and stream
        function). Irregular wave types are not supported. For information
        about wave types, see Hydrodynamic Loads in the Mechanical APDL Theory
        Reference.

        The program calculates the forces on each load component of each
        element at NPHASE solutions, spread evenly over one wave cycle. Then,
        the minimum and maximum, and the phase between them, are calculated.
        The command uses the resulting information to generate the real and
        imaginary loads.

        HOWP cannot be used with stress stiffening.

        HOWP works with the full harmonic analysis method (HROPT,FULL) only.

        For more information, see Harmonic Ocean Wave Procedure (HOWP) in the
        Mechanical APDL Theory Reference.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        APDL Command: PCGOPT

        Controls PCG solver options.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lev_diff
            Indicates the level of difficulty of the analysis. Valid settings
            are AUTO or 0 (default), 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This option applies to
            both the PCG solver when used in static and full transient analyses
            and to the PCG Lanczos method in modal analyses. Use AUTO to let
            ANSYS automatically choose the proper level of difficulty for the
            model. Lower values (1 or 2) generally provide the best performance
            for well-conditioned problems. Values of 3 or 4 generally provide
            the best performance for ill-conditioned problems; however, higher
            values may increase the solution time for well-conditioned
            problems. Higher level-of-difficulty values typically require more
            memory. Using the highest value of 5 essentially performs a
            factorization of the global matrix (similar to the sparse solver)
            and may require a very large amount of memory. If necessary, use
            Memory to reduce the memory usage when using  Lev_Diff = 5.
            Lev_Diff = 5 is generally recommended for small- to medium-sized
            problems when using the PCG Lanczos mode extraction method.

        --
            Unused field.

        reduceio
             Controls whether the PCG solver will attempt to reduce I/O
            performed during equation solution:

            AUTO  - Automatically chooses whether to reduce I/O or not (default).

            YES  - Reduces I/O performed during equation solution in order to reduce total solver
                   time.

            NO  - Does NOT reduce I/O performed during equation solution.

        strmck
             Controls whether or not a Sturm sequence check is performed:

            OFF  - Does NOT perform Sturm sequence check (default).

            ON  - Performs Sturm sequence check

        wrtfull
            Controls whether or not the .FULL file is written.

            ON  - Write .FULL file (default)

            OFF  - Do not write .FULL file.

        memory
             Controls whether to run using in-core or out-of-core mode when
            using Lev_Diff = 5.

            AUTO  - Automatically chooses which mode to use (default).

            INCORE  - Run using in-core mode.

            OOC  - Run using out-of-core mode.

        lm_key
             Controls use of the PCG solver for MPC184 Lagrange multiplier
            method elements. This option applies only to the PCG solver when
            used in static and full transient analyses.

            OFF  - Do not use the PCG solver for the MPC184 Lagrange multiplier method (default).

            ON  - Allow use of the PCG solver for the MPC184 Lagrange multiplier method.

        Notes
        -----
        ReduceIO works independently of the MSAVE command in the PCG solver.
        Setting ReduceIO to YES can significantly increase the memory usage in
        the PCG solver.

        To minimize the memory used by the PCG solver with respect to the
        Lev_Diff option only, set  Lev_Diff = 1 if you do not have sufficient
        memory to run the PCG solver with  Lev_Diff = AUTO.

        The MSAVE,ON command is not valid when using  Lev_Diff = 5. In this
        case, the  Lev_Diff value will automatically be reset to 2. The
        MSAVE,ON command is also not valid with the StrmCk   option. In this

        Applies initial velocities to parts or part assemblies in an explicit

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Label identifying the option to be performed.

            VGEN - Define initial velocities for the part or part assembly based on translational
                   velocities (relative to global Cartesian) and the rotational
                   velocity about an arbitrary axis. For this option, use the
                   fields VX, VY, VZ to specify the translational velocities,
                   and use OMEGAX, XC, YC, ZC, ANGX, ANGY, ANGZ to specify the
                   rotational velocity and the axis of rotation.

            VELO - Define initial velocity for the part or part assembly based on translational
                   velocities and nodal rotational velocities input relative to
                   the global Cartesian axes. For this option, use the
                   following fields to define the initial velocity: VX, VY, VZ,
                   OMEGAX, OMEGAY, OMEGAZ.

            LIST - List initial velocity for the part or part assembly specified by PID. If PID is
                   blank, all initial velocities defined on parts and part
                   assemblies are listed. Remaining fields are ignored for this
                   option.

            DELE - Delete initial velocity defined for the part or part assembly specified by PID.
                   If PID is blank, all initial velocities defined on parts and
                   part assemblies are deleted. Remaining fields are ignored
                   for this option.

        pid
            Part ID or part assembly ID to which the initial velocity is to be
            applied. The part or assembly ID must be defined (EDPART or EDASMP)
            before issuing this command.

        vx
            Initial velocity in X direction. Defaults to 0.

        vy
            Initial velocity in Y direction. Defaults to 0.

        vz
            Initial velocity in Z direction. Defaults to 0.

        omegax
            For Option = VGEN, OMEGAX is the initial rotational velocity of the
            part or part assembly about the specified rotational axis. For
            Option = VELO, OMEGAX is the initial nodal rotational velocity
            about the X-axis. OMEGAX defaults to 0.

        omegay
            Initial nodal rotational velocity about the Y-axis (used only if
            Option = VELO). Defaults to 0.

        omegaz
            Initial nodal rotational velocity about the Z-axis (used only if
            Option = VELO). Defaults to 0.

        Notes
        -----
        You cannot mix the two methods of initial velocity input (Option = VELO
        and Option = VGEN) in the same analysis. You must use only one method
        for all initial velocity definitions.

        The VGEN and VELO methods differ in how the rotational velocity is
        defined. Use Option = VGEN to input the initial velocities of a
        rotating part or part assembly. Use Option = VELO to apply the
        rotations directly to the nodes' rotation degrees of freedom. Since
        only shell and beam elements have rotation degrees of freedom, the
        rotations input with Option = VELO are only applicable to SHELL163 and
        BEAM161 elements. The rotational velocities input with Option = VELO
        are ignored for nodes not having rotational degrees of freedom (such as
        nodes attached to a SOLID164 or SOLID168 element).

        It is normally acceptable to mix nodes belonging to deformable bodies
        and rigid bodies in the part assembly used in an initial velocity
        definition. However, when defining initial velocities in an implicit-
        to-explicit sequential solution, this is not an acceptable practice. In
        order for the initial velocities to be defined correctly in this type
        of analysis, you must define the initial velocities on the deformable
        body nodes separately from the initial velocities on the rigid body
        nodes.

        Issuing the EDPVEL command again for the same part or part assembly
        (PID) will overwrite previous initial velocities defined for that part
        or part assembly.

        To set the initial velocities to zero, issue the EDPVEL command with
        only the Option (use VELO or VGEN) and PID fields specified.

        In a small restart analysis (EDSTART,2), you can only use the Option =
        VELO method to change initial velocities. When used in a small restart,
        the command EDPVEL,VELO changes the velocity of the specified part or
        part assembly. If you don't change the velocity of the parts and
        assemblies, their velocity at the beginning of the restart will be the
        same as the velocity at the end of the previous analysis.

        Except for the LIST option, the EDPVEL command is not supported in a
        full restart analysis (EDSTART,3). You can list initial velocities
        defined in the previous analysis with the command EDPVEL,LIST. However,
        you cannot change initial velocities for parts that existed in the
        previous analysis; their velocity at the beginning of the analysis will
        be the same as the velocity at the end of the previous analysis. In
        addition, you cannot define initial velocities for any parts that are
        added in the full restart; the velocity of new parts will be zero.

        To apply initial velocities to node components or nodes, use the EDVEL
        command.

        You can use EDPVEL and EDVEL in the same analysis. If a node or node
        component input on the EDVEL command shares common nodes with a part or
        part assembly input on the EDPVEL command, the initial velocities
        defined on the common nodes will be determined by the last command
        input.

            See File Management and Files for file descriptions.  If blank,
            list currently reassigned files.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        lgkey
            Key to specify local or global file name control for the specified
            file identifier in a distributed-memory parallel processing
            (Distributed ANSYS) run. For more information on local and global
            files, see File Handling Conventions in the Parallel Processing
            Guide.

            BOTH - Reassign the file name for both the local and global files (default).

            LOCAL - Reassign the file name for only the local files.

            GLOBAL - Reassign the file name for only the global file.

        Notes
        -----
        The reassignment of file names is valid only if it is done before the
        file is used.  All file reassignments are retained (not cleared) even

        APDL Command: KREFINE

        Refines the mesh around specified keypoints.

        Parameters
        ----------
        np1, np2, ninc
            Keypoints (NP1 to NP2 in increments of NINC) around which the mesh
            is to be refined.  NP2 defaults to NP1, and NINC defaults to 1.  If
            NP1 = ALL, NP2 and NINC are ignored and all selected keypoints are
            used for refinement.  If NP1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and
            all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).
            A component name may also be substituted for NP1 (NP2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of the number of elements outward
            from the indicated keypoints (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        KREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified keypoints.
        By default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements
        with 1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        KREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified keypoints.  Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified keypoints, but are not tetrahedra (for
        example, hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements.  This applies

            Old part ID or part assembly ID in the previous analysis, (default

        Notes
        -----
        The EDIS command is only valid in an explicit dynamic full restart
        analysis (EDSTART,3). (EDIS is ignored if it is not preceded by the
        EDSTART,3 command.) Use EDIS to specify which parts and/or part
        assemblies should undergo stress initialization in the restart based on
        the stresses from the previous analysis. You can specify stress
        initialization for multiple parts (or part assemblies) by issuing EDIS
        multiple times. If you issue EDIS with no arguments, stress
        initialization is performed for all parts in the restart analysis that
        have a corresponding part (having the same part ID) in the previous
        analysis.

        In a full restart analysis, the complete database is written as an LS-
        DYNA input file, Jobname_nn.K. When the LS-DYNA solution begins, LS-
        DYNA performs the stress initialization using file Jobname_nn.K and the
        restart dump file (d3dumpnn specified on the EDSTART command) from the
        previous analysis. At the end of initialization, all the parts that
        were specified by the EDIS commands are initialized from the data saved
        in the restart dump file. In order for the stress initialization to be
        performed successfully, the new parts in the full restart analysis and
        the old parts in the previous analysis must have the same number of
        elements, same element order, and same element topology. (The parts may
        have different identifying numbers.) If this is not the case, the
        stresses cannot be initialized. If part assemblies are used, the part
        assemblies must contain the same number of parts. (See A Full Restart
        in the ANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide for more details).

        You can use the CMDOMEGA command in conjunction with any one of the

        Components for which you want to specify rotational loading must

        vector and writes it to the mode shape file, which you can apply via
        the LVSCALE command.

        Defines a rigid region.

        Parameters
        ----------
        maste
            Retained (or master) node for this rigid region.  If MASTE = P,
            then graphical picking of the master and slave nodes is enabled
            (first node picked will be the master node, and subsequent nodes
            picked will be slave  nodes), and subsequent fields are ignored
            (valid only in GUI).

        slave
            Removed (or slave) node for this rigid region.  If ALL, slave nodes
            are all selected nodes.

        ldof
            Degrees of freedom associated with equations:

            ALL - All applicable degrees of freedom (default).  If 3-D, generate 6 equations
                  based on UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ;  if 2-D, generate 3
                  equations based on UX, UY, ROTZ.

            UXYZ - Translational degrees of freedom.  If 3-D, generate 3 equations based on the
                   slave nodes' UX, UY, and UZ DOFs and the master node's UX,
                   UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, and ROTZ DOFs;  if 2-D, generate 2
                   equations based on the slave nodes UX and UY DOFs and the
                   master nodes UX, UY, and ROTZ DOFs.  No equations are
                   generated for the rotational coupling.

            RXYZ - Rotational degrees of freedom.  If 3-D, generate 3 equations based on ROTX,
                   ROTY, ROTZ;  if 2-D, generate 1 equation based on ROTZ.  No
                   equations are generated for the translational coupling.

            UX - Slave translational UX degree of freedom only.

            UY - Slave translational UY degree of freedom only.

            UZ - Slave translational UZ degree of freedom only.

            ROTX - Slave rotational ROTX degree of freedom only.

            ROTY - Slave rotational ROTY degree of freedom only.

            ROTZ - Slave rotational ROTZ degree of freedom only.

        ldof2, ldof3, ldof4, ldof5
            Additional degrees of freedom.  Used only if more than one degree
            of freedom required and Ldof is not ALL, UXYZ, or RXYZ.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines a rigid region (link, area or volume) by automatically
        generating constraint equations to relate nodes in the region.  Nodes
        in the rigid region must be assigned a geometric location before this
        command is used.  Also, nodes must be connected to elements having the
        required degree of freedom set (see Ldof above).  Generated constraint
        equations are based on small deflection theory.  Generated constraint
        equations are numbered beginning from the highest previously defined
        equation number (NEQN) plus 1.  Equations, once generated, may be
        listed [CELIST] or modified [CE] as desired.  Repeat CERIG command for
        additional rigid region equations.

        This command will generate the constraint equations needed for defining
        rigid lines in 2-D or 3-D space.  Multiple rigid lines relative to a
        common point are used to define a rigid area or a rigid volume.  In 2-D
        space, with Ldof = ALL, three equations are generated for each pair of
        constrained nodes.  These equations define the three rigid body motions
        in global Cartesian space, i.e., two in-plane translations and one in-
        plane rotation.  These equations assume the X-Y plane to be the active
        plane with UX, UY, and ROTZ degrees of freedom available at each node.
        Other types of equations can be generated with the appropriate Ldof
        labels.

        Six equations are generated for each pair of constrained nodes in 3-D
        space (with Ldof = ALL).  These equations define the six rigid body
        motions in global Cartesian space.  These equations assume that UX, UY,
        UZ, ROTX, ROTY, and ROTZ degrees of freedom are available at each node.

        The UXYZ label allows generating a partial set of rigid region
        equations.  This option is useful for transmitting the bending moment
        between elements having different degrees of freedom at a node.  With
        this option only two of the three equations are generated for each pair
        of constrained nodes in 2-D space.  In 3-D space, only three of the six
        equations are generated.  In each case the rotational coupling
        equations are not generated.  Similarly, the RXYZ label allows
        generating a partial set of equations with the translational coupling
        equations omitted.

        Applying this command to a large number of slave nodes may result in
        constraint equations with a large number of coefficients. This may
        significantly increase the peak memory required during the process of
        element assembly. If real memory or virtual memory is not available,
        consider reducing the number of slave nodes.

        Note that under certain circumstances the constraint equations
        generated by CERIG may be modified during the solution. See Program
        Modification of Constraint Equations for more information.

        As an alternative to the CERIG command, you can define a similar type
        of rigid region using contact elements and the internal multipoint
        constraint (MPC) algorithm. See Surface-Based Constraints for more
        information.

        CERIG cannot be deleted using CEDELE,ALL and then regenerated in the
        second or higher load steps if the LSWRITE  and LSSOLVE procedure is
        used. CERIG writes constraint equations directly into load step files.
        Deleting constraint equations (CEDELE,ALL) cannot always maintain the
        consistency among load steps.

        APDL Command: TORUS

        Creates a toroidal volume.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rad1, rad2, rad3
            Three values that define the radii of the torus.  You can specify
            the radii in any order.  The smallest of the values is the inner
            minor radius, the intermediate value is the outer minor radius, and
            the largest value is the major radius.  (There is one exception
            regarding the order of the radii values--if you want to create a
            solid torus, specify zero or blank for the inner minor radius, in
            which case the zero or blank must occupy either the RAD1 or RAD2
            position.)  At least two of the values that you specify must be
            positive values; they will be used to define the outer minor radius
            and the major radius.  See the diagram in the Notes section for a
            view of a toroidal sector showing all radii.

        theta1, theta2
            Starting and ending angles (either order) of the torus.  Used for
            creating a toroidal sector.  The sector begins at the algebraically
            smaller angle, extends in a positive angular direction, and ends at
            the larger angle.  The starting angle defaults to 0° and the ending
            angle defaults to 360°.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines a toroidal volume centered about the working plane origin.  A
        solid torus of 360° will be defined with four areas, each area spanning
        180° around the major and minor circumference.

        To create the toroidal sector shown below, the command
        TORUS,5,1,2,0,180 was issued.  Since "1" was the smallest radii value
        specified, it defined the inner minor radius; since "2" was the
        intermediate radii value specified, it defined the outer minor radius;
        and since "5" was the largest radii value specified, it defined the
        major radius.  The values "0" and "180" defined the starting and ending
        angles of the torus.

        Notes

        the solution. If the angle is specified, it produces the following:

        Where:

        RR and RI are, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of the
        results quantity (e.g. the nodal displacements, the reaction forces,
        ...).

        α is the angle (OMEGAT).

        1STLCASE and 2NDLCASE are internally generated load cases. You may want
        to specify these to avoid overwriting an existing load case number 1 or
        2.

        Not all results computed by this command are valid. See Summable, Non-
        Summable and Constant Data in the Basic Analysis Guide for more
        information. When the amplitude of the solution is requested (OMEGAT >=
        360°), averaged values (such as the nodal component stresses, which are
        an average of element nodal component stresses) are calculated by
        averaging the amplitudes. Because the degrees of freedom results have
        different phases, derived results (such as the equivalent stress SEQV)
        are not valid. See POST1 and POST26 – Complex Results Postprocessing
        for more details about post-processing complex results.

        For postprocessing amplitudes, the only appropriate coordinate system
        is the solution coordinate system (RSYS ,SOLU).  When displaying the
        displacement amplitudes, use a contour display (PLNSOL command).
        Because a deformed shape display (PLDISP command) could lead to a non-
        physical shape, the displacement scaling is off by default
        (/DSCALE,,OFF).

        For postprocessing cylindrical geometry, it is suggested that you
        rotate the element coordinate systems into the appropriate cylindrical
        system (EMODIF,,ESYS) before running the solution and then view the
        results in this system (RSYS,SOLU) in POST1.

        Since HRCPLX performs load case combinations, it alters most of the
        data in the database. In particular, it alters applied loads such as
        forces and imposed displacements. To restore the original loads in the
        database for a subsequent analysis, reissue the SET command in POST1 to
        retrieve the real and imaginary set data.

        To animate the solution over one period, use the ANHARM command.

        OMEGAT is not equal to the phase shift.

        SF,,FSIN) in the structural model are written to the one-way coupling
        result data file during the structural solution.

        One-way coupling results data are read into the acoustic model as the
        velocity (harmonic) or acceleration (transient) excitation during the
        sequential acoustic solution.

        If Oper = NOMAP, both structural and acoustic models must share the
        same node number on the one-way coupling interface.

        If Oper = MAP:

        The one-way coupling interface must be defined in the acoustic model
        (SF,,FSIN) such that it corresponds to the field-surface interface
        number (FSIN) in the structural model.

        The output points are correct only if they are within the boundaries
        set via the specified input points.

        Calculations for out-of-bound points require much more processing time
        than do points that are within bounds.

        For each point in the acoustic destination mesh, the command searches
        all possible triangles in the structural source mesh to find the best
        triangle containing each point, then performs a linear interpolation
        inside this triangle. For faster and more accurate results, consider
        your interpolation method and search criteria carefully (see LIMIT).

        One-way coupling excitation can be applied to multiple frequencies or
        time steps.

        Sets various line graph display options.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Apply display style as selected from the following labels:

            AXDV - Axis division (tick) marks (defaults to KEY = ON).

            AXNM - Axis scale numbers (defaults to KEY = ON, which puts numbers at the back plane
                   of the graph).  If KEY = FRONT, numbers are on the front
                   plane of the graph.

            AXNSC - Axis number size scale factor.  Input the scale value for KEY (defaults to
                    1.0).

            ASCAL - Automatic scaling of additional Y-axes for multi-curve [/GRTYP, 2 or 3] graphs
                    (defaults to KEY = ON).  If KEY = OFF, use base Y-axis
                    scaling (see the /YRANGE command).

            LOGX - Log X scale (defaults to KEY = OFF (linear)).

            LOGY - Log Y scale (applies only to the base Y axis) (defaults to KEY = OFF (linear)).

            FILL - Color fill areas under curves (defaults to KEY = OFF).

            CGRID - Superimpose background grid [/GRID] over areas under filled curves (defaults to
                    KEY = OFF).

            DIG1 - Number of significant digits before decimal point for axis values.  Input the
                   value for KEY (defaults to 4).

            DIG2 - Number of significant digits after decimal point for axis values.  Input the
                   value for KEY (defaults to 3).

            VIEW - View key for graph displays (defaults to KEY = OFF, in which case the view is
                   (0,0,1) for 2-D graph displays or (1,2,3) for 3-D graph
                   displays).  If KEY = ON, the view settings for graph
                   displays are the same as the view settings for the model.

            REVX - Plots the values on the X-axis in reverse order.

            REVY - Plots the values on the Y-axis in reverse order.

            DIVX - Determines the number of divisions (grid markers) that will be plotted on the X
                   axis.

            DIVY - Determines the number of divisions (grid markers) that will be plotted on the Y
                   axis.

            LTYP - Determines whether ANSYS generated (KEY = 1) or system derived (KEY = 0) fonts
                   will be used for the axis labels.

            CURL - Determines the position of the curve labels. If (KEY = 1), the curve label will
                   be plotted in the legend column, and the label will be
                   displayed in the same color as the curve. If (KEY = 0) the
                   curve labels will be plotted near the curve. (default).

            XAXO - When you use this label, the subsequent KEY value will determine an offset
                   amount from the default (along the bottom) location for the
                   X axis. If KEY = 1.0, a full offset occurs (the X axis is
                   moved to the top of the graph). If KEY = 0.5, the axis is
                   offset to the midpoint of the graph, and if KEY = 0 the axis
                   remains in the original position, along the bottom of the
                   graph. For any offset, a grey copy of the original axis
                   (containing the axis numbering) remains at the original
                   location.

            YAXO - When you use this label, the subsequent KEY value will determine an offset
                   amount from the default (along the left side of the graph)
                   location for the Y axis. If KEY = 1.0, a full offset occurs
                   (the Y axis is moved to the right side of the graph). If KEY
                   = 0.5, the axis is offset to the midpoint of the graph, and
                   if KEY = 0 the axis remains in the original position, along
                   the left side of the graph. For any offset, a gray copy of
                   the original axis (containing the axis numbering) remains at
                   the original location.

        key
            Option values:

            OFF (0) - Do not apply selected style.

            ON (1) - Apply selected style.

            nnnn - If Lab is DIG1 or DIG2, input the number of digits.

            nn - If Lab is AXNSC, input the scale factor.

            FRONT - If Lab is AXNM, FRONT may also be input.

            Ndiv - If Lab is DIVX or DIVY, determines the number of divisions (1-99) that will be
                   applied to the axis.

            Kfont - If Lab is LTYP, Kfont is ON (1) or OFF(0).  ON will use ANSYS generated fonts
                    for the axis labels, while OFF will use SYSTEM (Windows,
                    X-system, etc.) fonts. The default value is ON (ANSYS
                    fonts).

        key

        Notes

        When selected manually (RMMSELECT), modes must be classified as
        dominant, relevant, or unused. Dominant modes (Key = DOMINANT) are
        basis functions with large amplitudes. Relevant modes (Key = RELEVANT)
        are influenced by the dominant modes but do not cause interactions
        among themselves due to the small amplitude. This assumption leads to
        essential speed up of the sample point generator (see RMSMPLE).

        form
            Specifies format of output matrix file:

            ASCII - Write output matrix file in ASCII form.

            BIN - Write output matrix file in binary form.

        matrx
            Specify which matrix to write to the output matrix file:

            STIFF - Write stiffness matrix to output matrix file.  Valid for all types of analyses
                    that write a .FULL file.

            MASS - Write mass matrix to output matrix file.  Valid for buckling, substructure, and
                   modal analyses.  If .FULL file was generated in a buckling
                   analysis, then this label will write stress stiffening
                   matrix to output matrix file.

            DAMP - Write damping matrix to output matrix file.  Only valid for damped modal
                   analyses.

        rhs
            Specifies whether to write the right-hand side vector to output
            matrix file:

            YES - Write right-hand side vector to output matrix file.

            NO - Do not write right-hand side vector to output matrix file.

        mapping
            Specifies whether to write the mapping file. This file is always
            named Fname.MAPPING.

            YES - Write the mapping file.

            NO - Do not write the mapping file (default).

        Notes
        -----
        This command is used to copy a matrix from the assembled global matrix
        file (.FULL file) or from the superelement matrix file (.SUB file) as
        specified on the FILEAUX2 command and write it in Harwell-Boeing format
        to a new file, named jobname.MATRIX.  The Harwell-Boeing format is
        widely used by other applications that deal with matrices.

        The assembled global matrix file is created during solution depending
        on the analysis type, equation solver, and other solution options.  By
        default, the assembled global matrix file is never deleted at the end
        of solution. For most analysis types, the Sparse direct solver and the
        ICCG solver will write a .FULL file. All mode extraction methods used
        for buckling and modal analyses will write a properly formatted .FULL
        file to be used with the HBMAT command. However, when using Distributed
        ANSYS, a majority of analyses will write a distributed (or local) form
        of the .FULL file which is not currently supported by the HBMAT
        command.

        When dumping the stiffness matrix for transient and harmonic analyses,
        be aware that the element mass matrix values (and possibly element
        damping matrix values) are incorporated into the globally assembled
        stiffness matrix.  Thus, the globally assembled stiffness matrix
        represents more than the stiffness of the model for these analysis
        types.  Please refer to the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for more
        details.

        When dumping a .FULL file, the rows and columns corresponding to
        specified constraints (e.g., D commands) are eliminated from the system
        of equations and therefore are not written to the .MATRIX file. Also,
        rows and columns corresponding to eliminated (slave) degrees of freedom
        from coupling and/or constraint equations (e.g., CE, CP commands) are
        also eliminated from the system of equations and are not written to the
        .MATRIX file. The DOFs that are eliminated from any coupling and/or
        constraint equations are determined internally by the solution code and
        may not match what you specified via the CE/CP (or similar) commands.

        When dumping a .SUB file, the full nxn matrix will be written to the
        .MATRIX file for either symmetric or unsymmetric matrices, regardless
        of whether any of the matrix coefficients are zero-valued. When dumping
        a .FULL file, only the lower triangular part of the matrix will be
        written to the .MATRIX file if the matrix is symmetric; the full matrix
        is written if the matrix is unsymmetric. Only matrix coefficients that
        are greater than zero will be written.

        The Harwell-Boeing format is column-oriented.  That is, non-zero matrix
        values are stored with their corresponding row indices in a sequence of
        columns.  However, since the ANSYS matrix files are stored by row and
        not column, when the HBMAT command is used with a non-symmetric matrix,
        the transpose of the matrix is, in fact, written.

        The WRFULL command, in conjunction with the SOLVE command, can be used
        to generate the assembled global matrix file and eliminate the equation
        solution process and results output process.

        The mapping file can be used to map the matrix equation numbers found
        in the .MATRIX file directly to the corresponding node numbers and
        degrees of freedom.

        When dumping a CMS .SUB file, the last rows/columns of the matrix are
        non-physical degrees of freedom added internally by the CMS process and
        cannot be mapped directly to a node number or particular degree of
        freedom.

        If Rlab is left blank, then the result set label is inherited from the
        last PDEXE command (Slab), RSFIT command (RSlab), or the most recently
        used PDS postprocessing command where a result set label was explicitly
        specified.

        If the parameter data for Name1 includes negative values, fitting a
        logarithmic trendline is not possible and the logarithmic trendline
        plot is suppressed if requested. The same applies for an exponential
        trendline if the data for the Name2 includes negative values.

        Because of the amount of data involved, the scatter plot is limited to
        NMAX points. If shown, the trendline is evaluated only on the NMAX
        points shown. However, the statistical information shown in the plot,
        such as the mean value lines for both parameters and the correlation
        coefficients listed in the legend are based on the full set of samples.
        If required, you can increase NMAX to plot more points, but this will
        affect the time needed to process the PDSCAT command. If NMAX is less
        than the total amount of simulated points, which is typically possible
        for Response Surface Methods, you will see an appropriate warning in
        the plot legend.

            below.  Some items also require a component label.

            shown in Table 216: PDEF - Valid Item and Component Labels below.

        avglab

        Notes
        -----
        Defines and interpolates a labeled path item along a predefined path
        (PATH).  Path item results are in the global Cartesian coordinate
        directions unless transformed (RSYS).  A path item must be defined
        before it can be used with other path operations.  Additional path
        items may be defined from the PVECT, PCALC, PDOT, and PCROSS commands.
        Path items may be listed (PRPATH) or displayed (PLPATH, PLPAGM).  A
        maximum number of path items permitted is established by the nSets
        argument specified with the PATH command.

        When you create the first path item (PDEF or PVECT), the program
        automatically interpolates four path items which are used to describe
        the geometry of the path.  These predefined items are the position of
        the interpolated path points (labels XG, YG, and ZG) in global
        Cartesian coordinates, and the path length (label S).  For alternate
        methods of mapping the path geometry (to include, for example, material
        discontinuity) see the PMAP command.  These items may also be listed or
        displayed with the PRPATH, PLPATH, and PLPAGM commands.

        If specifying that load case operations act on principal/equivalent
        stresses (SUMTYPE,PRIN), derived quantities (principal and equivalent
        stresses/strains) will be zero for path plots. A typical use for such a
        case involves mode combinations in a response spectrum analysis.

        The number of interpolation points on the path is defined by the nDiv
        argument on the PATH command.  See Mapping Nodal and Element Data onto
        the Path in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for details.  Use
        PDEF,STAT to list the path item labels.  Use PDEF,CLEAR to erase all
        labeled path items, except the path geometry items (XG, YG, ZG, S).

         For SHELL131 and SHELL132 elements with KEYOPT(3) = 0 or 1, use the

        the lower right array element (defined by the number of columns on this
        command and the number of rows on the *VLEN command).

        The default NCOL is calculated from the maximum number of columns of
        the result array (the *DIM column dimension) minus the starting
        location + 1.  For example, *DIM,R,,1,10 and a starting location of

        Parameters
        ----------
        secid
            Unique section number. This number must not already be assigned to
            a section.

        name
            Unique eight character descriptive name, if desired.

        p0
            Pretension node number. The node will be defined if it doesn't
            exist and the number defaults to the highest node number plus one.

        egroup, num
            Element group on which PSMESH will operate. If Egroup = P,
            graphical picking is enabled and NUM is ignored (valid only in the
            GUI).

            L (or LINE) - PSMESH operates on all elements in the line specified by NUM. New pretension
                          nodes are associated with NUM or entities below it.
                          Any subsequent LCLEAR operation of NUM deletes the
                          pretension elements and nodes created by PSMESH.

            A (or AREA) - PSMESH operates on all elements in the area specified by NUM. New pretension
                          nodes are associated with NUM or entities below it.
                          Any subsequent ACLEAR of NUM deletes the pretension
                          elements and nodes created by PSMESH.

            V (or VOLU) - PSMESH operates on all elements in the volume specified by NUM. New pretension
                          nodes are associated with NUM or entities below it.
                          Any subsequent VCLEAR of NUM deletes the pretension
                          elements and nodes created by PSMESH.

            P - PSMESH operates on elements selected through the subsequent picking operations,
                and NUM is ignored

            ALL - The command operates on all selected elements, and NUM is ignored.

        kcn
            Coordinate system number for the separation surface and normal
            direction.

        kdir
            Direction (x, y, or z) normal to separation surface in the KCN
            coordinate system.

        value
            Point along the KDIR axis at which to locate the separation
            surface. Ignored if NDPLANE is supplied.

        ndplane
            Existing node that PSMESH will use to locate the separation
            surface. If NDPLANE is supplied, the location of the separation
            surface is defined by the KDIR coordinate of NDPLANE.

        pstol
            Optional tolerance below VALUE. Allows nodes occurring precisely at
            or slightly below the separation  to be identified properly as
            above the plane. Has the effect of shifting the plane down by
            PSTOL.  The following expression represents the default value:

        pstype
            If specified, this value is the type number for pretension
            elements. (If not specified, ANSYS defines this value.) If already
            defined, it must be of type PRETS179.

        ecomp
            If specified, the name of a component to be composed of new
            pretension elements and existing elements modified by the PSMESH
            command.

        ncomp
            Name of a component to be composed of nodes on new pretension
            elements.

        Notes
        -----
        The PSMESH command creates a pretension section normal to the
        pretension load direction by cutting the mesh along existing element
        boundaries at the point defined by VALUE or NDPLANE and inserting
        PRETS179 elements. The PSMESH command verifies that PSTYPE is PRETS179;
        if it is not, the command finds the lowest available ITYPE that is
        PRETS179, or if necessary will create a new one.

        When it is necessary to define the pretension node, ANSYS uses node
        NDPLANE. If the NDPLANE value is not specified, ANSYS defines the
        pretension node at:

        The centroid of geometric entity NUM, if Egroup = LINE, AREA or VOLU

        The centroid location of all selected elements, if Egroup = ALL or if
        graphical picking is used.

        If the elements to which the pretension load is to be applied have
        already been meshed in two groups, PSMESH cannot be used to insert the
        pretension elements. The EINTF command must be used to insert the
        PRETS179 elements between the two meshed groups.

        The PSMESH operation copies any nodal temperatures you have defined on
        the split surface of the original mesh from the original nodes to the
        newly created coincident duplicate nodes. However, displacements,
        forces, and other boundary conditions are not copied.

        By mathematical definition, the pretension surface must always be a
        flat plane. In a non-Cartesian coordinate system, the PSMESH command
        creates that plane at the indicated position, oriented with respect to
        the specified direction of the active system (in the same manner that
        the NROTAT command orients a nodal system with respect to a curved
        system). For example, assuming a X = 1 and Y = 45 in a cylindrical
        coordinate system with Z as the axis of rotation (KCN = 1), a
        pretension surface normal to X tilts 45 degrees away from the global X
        axis.

        The PSMESH command is valid for structural analyses only.

        var
            One of three variable field numbers in the monitor file whose
            contents can be specified by the Lab field.  Valid arguments are
            integers 1, 2, or 3. See Notes section for default values.

        node
            The node number for which information is monitored in the specified
            VAR field.  In the GUI, if Node = P, graphical picking is enabled.
            If blank, the monitor file lists the maximum value of the specified
            quantity (Lab field) for the entire structure.

        lab
            The solution quantity to be monitored in the specified VAR field.
            Valid labels for solution quantities are UX, UY, and UZ
            (displacements); ROTX, ROTY, and ROTZ (rotations); and TEMP
            (temperature).  Valid labels for reaction force are FX, FY, and FZ
            (structural force) and MX, MY, and MZ (structural moment).  Valid
            label for heat flow rate is HEAT. For defaults see the Notes
            section.

        Notes
        -----
        The monitor file always has an extension of .mntr, and takes its file
        name from the specified Jobname.  If no Jobname is specified, the file
        name defaults to file.

        You must issue this command once for each solution quantity you want to
        monitor at a specified node at each load step. You cannot monitor a
        reaction force during a linear analysis. The variable field contents
        can be redefined at each load step by reissuing the command. The
        monitored quantities are appended to the file for each load step.

        Reaction forces reported in the monitor file may be incorrect if the
        degree of freedom of the specified node is involved in externally
        defined coupling (CP command) or constraint equations (CE command), or
        if the program has applied constraint equations internally to the node.

        The following example shows the format of a monitor file.  Note that
        the file only records the solution substep history when a substep is
        convergent.

        The following details the contents of the various fields in the monitor
        file:

        The current load step number.

        The current substep (time step) number.

        The number of attempts made in solving the current substep.  This
        number is equal to the number of failed attempts (bisections) plus one
        (the successful attempt).

        The number of iterations used by the last successful attempt.

        Total cumulative number of iterations (including each iteration used by
        a bisection).

        :

        Time or load factor increments for the current substep.

        Total time (or load factor) for the last successful attempt in the
        current substep.

        Variable field 1.  In this example, the field is reporting the UZ
        value.  By default, this field lists the CPU time used up to (but not
        including) the current substep.

        Variable field 2.  In this example, the field is reporting the MZ
        value.  By default, this field lists the maximum displacement in the
        entire structure.

        Variable field 3.  By default (and in the example), this field reports
        the maximum equivalent plastic strain increment in the entire
        structure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn
            Window number (or ALL) to which command applies (defaults to 1).

        ncont
            Number of contour values. NCONT defaults to 9 for X11 or WIN32 and
            to 128 for X11c or WIN32C.  The default graphics window display for
            3-D devices is a smooth continuous shading effect that spans the
            maximum of 128 contours available. Use the /DV3D command to create
            defined banding for your contour values (values of 9 and 128 are

            display only nine color boxes, which span the full range of colors
            displayed in the graphics window.

        vmin
            Minimum contour value.  If VMIN = AUTO, automatically calculate
            contour values based upon NCONT uniformly spaced values over the
            min-max extreme range.  Or, if VMIN = USER, set contour values to
            those of the last display (useful when last display automatically
            calculated contours).

        vinc
            Value increment (positive) between contour values.  Defaults to
            (VMAX-VMIN)/NCONT.

        vmax
            Maximum contour value.  Ignored if both VMIN and VINC are
            specified.

        Notes
        -----
        See the /CVAL command for alternate specifications.  Values represent
        contour lines in vector mode, and the algebraic maximum of contour
        bands in raster mode.

        Note:: : No matter how many contours (NCONT) are specified by /CONTOUR,
        the actual number of contours that appear on your display depends also
        on the device name, whether the display is directed to the screen or to
        a file, the display mode (vector or raster), and the number of color
        planes.  (All these items are controlled by /SHOW settings.) In any
        case, regardless of whether they are smoothed or banded, only 128
        contours can be displayed. See Creating Geometric Results Displays in
        the Basic Analysis Guide for more information on changing the number of
        contours.

            default value for NSIM is 10,000.

        seed
            Seed value label. Random number generators require a seed value
            that is used to calculate the next random number. After each random
            number generation finishes, the seed value is updated and is used

            initializes the seed value with the system time (one time only)
            when the ANSYS session started.

            CONT - Continues updating using the derived seed value (default).

            TIME - Initializes the seed value with the system time. You can use this if you want
                   the seed value set to a specific value for one analysis and
                   then you want to continue with a "random" seed in the next
                   analysis. It is not recommended to "randomize" the seed
                   value with the Seed = TIME option for multiple analyses. If

                   be appended to previously existing simulations, then the
                   Seed option is ignored and Seed = CONT is used.

            INIT - Initializes the seed value using 123457. This value is a typical recommendation
                   used very often in literature. This option leads to
                   identical random numbers for all random input variables when
                   the exact analysis will be repeated, making it useful for
                   benchmarking and validation purposes (where identical random
                   numbers are desired). If the Monte Carlo simulations
                   requested with this command will be appended to previously
                   existing simulations, then the Seed option is ignored and
                   Seed = CONT is used.

            Value - Uses the specified (positive) value for the initialization of the seed value.
                    This option has the same effect as Seed = INIT, except you
                    can chose an arbitrary (positive) number for the
                    initialization. If the Monte Carlo simulations requested
                    with this command will be appended to previously existing
                    simulations, then the Seed option is ignored and Seed =

        Parameters
        ----------
        key
            Calculation key:

             0  - No inertia relief calculations.

             1  - Counterbalance loads with inertia relief forces.

            -1  - Precalculate masses for summary printout only (no inertia relief).

        Notes
        -----
        The IRLF command specifies that the program is to calculate
        accelerations to counterbalance the applied loads (inertia relief).
        Displacement constraints on the structure should be only those
        necessary to prevent rigid-body motions (3 are needed for a 2-D
        structure and 6 for a 3-D structure).  The sum of the reaction forces
        at the constraint points will be zero.  Accelerations are calculated
        from the element mass matrices and the applied forces.  Data needed to
        calculate the mass (such as density) must be input.  Both translational
        and rotational accelerations may be calculated.

        This option applies only to the static (ANTYPE,STATIC) analysis.
        Nonlinearities, elements that operate in the nodal coordinate system,
        and axisymmetric or generalized plane strain elements are not allowed.
        Symmetry models are not valid for inertia relief analysis. Models with
        both 2-D and 3-D element types are not recommended.

        Loads may be input as usual.  Displacements and stresses are calculated
        as usual.

        Use IRLIST to print inertia relief calculation results.  The mass and
        moment of inertia summary printed before the solution is accurate
        (because of the additional pre-calculations required for inertia
        relief).  See Inertia Relief in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference
        for calculation details.  See also the Structural Analysis Guide for
        procedural details.

        If the inertia relief calculation is to be performed in the second or
        later load step, you must specify EMATWRITE,YES in the initial load
        step for the element matrices needed to perform the calculations to be
        available.

        When a superelement (MATRIX50) is present in the model, any DOF
        constraints that you need to apply (D) on a degree of freedom (DOF)
        belonging to the superelement must be applied in the use pass of the
        MATRIX50 element (not in the generation pass). The command has no
        effect in the generation pass of a substructure. In the expansion pass,
        precalculation of masses for summary printout (IRLF,-1) occurs only on
        elements that are part of the substructure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Degree of freedom label for coupled nodes (in the nodal coordinate
            system). If ALL, use all appropriate labels.  Valid labels are:
            Structural labels:  UX, UY, or UZ (displacements); ROTX, ROTY, or
            ROTZ (rotations, in radians).

        toler
            Tolerance for coincidence (based on maximum coordinate difference
            in each global Cartesian direction for node locations and on angle
            differences for node orientations).  Defaults to 0.0001. Only nodes
            within the tolerance are considered to be coincident for coupling.

        kcn
             In coordinate system KCN, node 1 of CP + dx dy dz = node 2 of CP.

        dx, dy, dz
            Node location increments in the active coordinate system (DR, Dθ,
            DZ for cylindrical, DR, D θ, DΦ for spherical or toroidal).

        knonrot
            When KNONROT = 0, the nodes on coupled sets are rotated into
            coordinate system KCN (see NROTAT command description). When
            KNONROT = 1, the nodes are not rotated, and you should make sure
            that coupled nodal DOF directions are correct.

        Notes
        -----
         Cyclic coupling requires identical node and element patterns on the
        low and high sector boundaries. The MSHCOPY operation allows convenient
        generation of identical node and element patterns. See Using CPCYC and
        MSHCOPY Commands in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for more

                   ANGLE, and NSET are ignored.)

        sbstep
            Substep number (within Lstep). Defaults to the last substep of the
            load step (except in a buckling or modal analysis). For a buckling
            (ANTYPE,BUCKLE) or modal (ANTYPE,MODAL) analysis, Sbstep
            corresponds to the mode number. Specify Sbstep = LAST to store the
            last substep for the specified load step (that is, issue a
            SET,Lstep,LAST command).

        fact
            Scale factor applied to data read from the file. If zero (or
            blank), a value of 1.0 is used. This scale factor is only applied
            to displacement and stress results. A nonzero factor excludes non-
            summable items.

        kimg
            Used only with complex results (harmonic and complex modal
            analyses).

            0 or REAL - Store the real part of complex solution (default).

            1, 2 or IMAG - Store the imaginary part of a complex solution.

            3 or AMPL - Store the amplitude

                        -180°  and +180°.

        time
            Time-point identifying the data set to be read.  For a harmonic
            analyses, time corresponds to the frequency.

        angle
            Circumferential location (0.0 to 360°).  Defines the
            circumferential location for the harmonic calculations used when
            reading from the results file.

        nset
            Data set number of the data set to be read.  If a positive value
            for NSET is entered, Lstep, Sbstep, KIMG, and TIME are ignored.
            Available set numbers can be determined by SET,LIST.

        order
            Key to sort the harmonic index results. This option applies to
            cyclic symmetry buckling and modal analyses only, and is valid only
            when Lstep = FIRST, LAST, NEXT, PREVIOUS, NEAR or LIST.

            ORDER  - Sort the harmonic index results in ascending order of eigenfrequencies or
                     buckling load multipliers.

            (blank)  - No sorting takes place.

        Notes
        -----
        Defines the data set to be read from the results file into the
        database.  Various operations may also be performed during the read
        operation.  The database must have the model geometry available (or use
        the RESUME command before the SET command to restore the geometry from
        Jobname.DB).  Values for applied constraints [D] and loads [F] in the
        database will be replaced by their corresponding values on the results
        file, if available. (See the description of the OUTRES command.)  In a
        single load step analysis, these values are usually the same, except
        for results from harmonic elements. (See the description of the ANGLE
        value above.)

        In an interactive run, the sorted list (ORDER option) is also available
        for results-set reading via a GUI pick option.

        You can postprocess results without issuing a SET command if the
        solution results were saved to the database file (Jobname.DB).
        Distributed ANSYS, however, can only postprocess using the results file
        (for example, Jobname.RST) and cannot use the Jobname.DB file since no
        solution results are written to the database. Therefore, you must issue
        a SET command or a RESCOMBINE command before postprocessing in
        Distributed ANSYS.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rlab
            Result set label. Identifies the result set to be used for
            postprocessing. A result set label can be the solution set label
            you defined in a PDEXE command (if you are directly postprocessing
            Monte Carlo Simulation results), or the response surface set label
            defined in an RSFIT command (for Response Surface Analyses).

        name
            Parameter name. The parameter must have been previously defined as
            a random input variable or a random output parameter with the PDVAR
            command.

        ncl
            Number of classes for the histogram plot. This is the number of
            bars shown in the histogram. NCL must be a positive number. If this
            field is left blank, Mechanical APDL calculates an appropriate
            number of classes based on the sample size. ANSYS divides the range
            between the smallest and largest sample value into NCL classes of
            equal width and determines the histogram frequencies by counting
            the number of hits that fall in the classes.

        type
            Type of histogram.

            ABS - Absolute frequency histogram. This is the actual number of hits in each class.

            REL - Relative frequency histogram (default). This is the number of hits in the
                  individual classes divided by the total number of samples.

            NORM - Normalized frequency histogram. This is the number of hits in the individual
                   classes divided by the total number of samples and divided
                   by the width of the class. This normalization makes the
                   histogram comparable to the probability density function.

        Notes
        -----
        Plots the frequency histogram.

        If Rlab is left blank, then the result set label is inherited from the
        last PDEXE command (Slab), RSFIT command (RSlab), or the most recently
        used PDS postprocessing command where a result set label was explicitly
        specified.

        The PDHIST command cannot be used to postprocess the results in a

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Valid body load label.  If ALL, use all appropriate labels.

        value
            Uniform value associated with Lab item, or table name when
            specifying tabular boundary conditions.  To specify a table,
            enclose the table name in percent signs (%), e.g.,
            BFUNIF,Lab,%tabname%.

        Notes
        -----
        In a transient or nonlinear thermal analysis, the uniform temperature
        is used during the first iteration of a solution as follows:  (a) as
        the starting nodal temperature (except where temperatures are
        explicitly specified [D, DK]), and (b) to evaluate temperature-
        dependent material properties.  In a structural analysis or explicit
        dynamic analysis, the uniform temperature is used as the default
        temperature for thermal strain calculations and material property
        evaluation (except where body load temperatures are specified [BF, BFE,
        BFK, LDREAD]).  In other scalar field analyses, the uniform temperature
        is used for material property evaluation.

        When the command BFUNIF,TEMP is used in an explicit dynamic analysis,
        you cannot use the EDLOAD,TEMP command to apply temperature loading.
        Furthermore, any temperature loading defined by BFUNIF cannot be listed
        or deleted by the EDLOAD command.

        An alternate command, TUNIF, may be used to set the uniform temperature
        instead of BFUNIF,TEMP. Since TUNIF (or BFUNIF,TEMP) is step-applied in
        the first iteration, you should use BF, ALL, TEMP, Value to ramp on a
        uniform temperature load.

        You can specify a table name only when using temperature (TEMP), heat
        generation rate (HGEN), and diffusing substance generation rate (DGEN)
        body load labels. When using TEMP, you can define a one-dimensional
        table that varies with respect to time (TIME) only. When defining this
        table, enter TIME as the primary variable. No other primary variables
        are valid. Tabular boundary conditions cannot be used in an explicit
        dynamic analysis.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        otype
            Data order:

            ORDER - Data is in an ordered list (such as for the E,P51X and A,P51X commands, in

        tol
            Angle tolerance (in degrees) between adjacent ELBOW290 elements.

            BALL - Create ball joints (equivalent to releasing ROTX, ROTY, and ROTZ).

        cons1, cons2, cons3, cons4
            Section degrees of freedoms to constrain. If Cons1 through Cons4
            are unspecified, no section constraints are applied:

            SECT  - All section deformation

        The ELBOW command specifies end releases and section constraints for

        elements.

        Curved PIPE289 elements are not converted to ELBOW290 elements.

        ELBOW290 elements are generated only if there are existing ELBOW290
        elements in the curved areas.

        The command works on currently selected nodes and elements. It creates
        end releases on any two connected elbow elements whose angle at
        connection exceeds the specified tolerance. From within the GUI, the

        This command controls options relating to the domain decomposition

        The greedy domain decomposition algorithm starts from a single element
        at a corner of the model. The domain grows by taking the properly
        connected neighboring elements and stops after reaching the optimal
        size.

        The METIS domain decomposition algorithm starts by creating a graph
        from the finite element mesh. It then uses a multilevel graph
        partitioning scheme which reduces the size of the original graph,
        creates domains using the reduced graph, and then creates the final CPU
        domains by expanding the smaller domains from the reduced graph back to
        the original mesh.

            Matrix type:

            Double precision real values (default). - Complex double precision values.

        method
            Method used to create the matrix:

            Allocate space for a matrix (default). - Resize an existing matrix to new row and column dimensions. Values are kept
                              from the original matrix. If the dimensions
                              specified by Val1 (rows) and Val2 (columns) are
                              greater than the original matrix size, the
                              additional entries are assigned a value of zero.

            Copy an existing matrix. - Link to an existing matrix. The memory will be shared between the original
                              matrix and the new matrix. This is useful for
                              manipulating a submatrix of a larger matrix. The
                              Val1 through Val5 arguments will be used to
                              specify the lower and upper bounds of row and
                              column numbers from the original matrix.

        val1, val2, val3, val4, val5
            Additional input. The meaning of Val1 through Val5 will vary
            depending on the specified Method. See details below.

        Notes
        -----
        This command allows you to create a dense matrix. To create a sparse
        matrix, use the *SMAT command. *SMAT is recommended for large matrices
        obtained from the .FULL or .HBMAT file. Refer to the HBMAT command
        documentation for more information about .FULL file contents.

        Use the *VEC command to create a vector.

        For very large matrices, use the OUTOFCORE option (Method = ALLOC or
        COPY) to keep some of the matrix on disk if there is insufficient
        memory.

        When importing a dense matrix from a DMIG file, you can define the
        formatting of the file using the Val3 and Val4 fields. Here are a few
        different example of formats:

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            You can apply texture according to the following labels:

            ELEM - Apply texture to elements N1 through N2 in steps of NINC.

            AREA - Apply texture to areas N1 through N2 in steps of NINC.

            VOLU - Apply texture to volumes N1 through N2 in steps of NINC.

            CM - Apply texture to the component named in N1. N2 and NINC are ignored.

            ON, OFF - Sets the specified texture display on or off. All other fields are ignored.

            File - If Lab = File, the command format is /TXTRE, File, Key_Index, Fname, Fext, --,
                   Format (This variant of the command is applicable to 2-D
                   drivers).

            Key_Index - The texture index associated with the file. If the number fifty-one (51) is
                        used, the imported bitmap will be used as the window's
                        logo.

            Fname - File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the characters
                    needed for the directory path).  An unspecified directory
                    path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
                    can use all 248 characters for the file name.

            Fext - Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

            -- - Unused field.

            Format - The file format. If Format = 0, the file is a pixmap (Linux) or Bitmap (PC).
                     The file cannot contain a compressed image, and the PC
                     file must be 8 or 24 bit BI_RGB format. If Format = 1 or
                     JPEG, then the file is in JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts
                     Group) format. If Format = 2 or PNG, then the file is in

            enabled.

        Notes
        -----
         This command is available for 3-D Open GL devices. 2-D devices are
        supported only for the Lab = File variation of the command, allowing
        imported bitmaps to be used for texturing and annotation. Textures can
        affect the speed of many of your display operations. You can increase
        the speed by temporarily turning the textures off (Utility Menu>
        PlotCtrls> Style> Texturing(3D)> Display Texturing). This menu
        selection toggles your textures on and off. When textures are toggled
        off, all of the texture information is retained and reapplied when
        texturing is toggled back on.

        For some displays, the texture will appear distorted because of a
        technique used to enhance 3-D displays (/DV3D,TRIS,1). Disabling this
        function (/DV3D,TRIS,0) will improve the quality of some texture
        displays. Disabling the TRIS option of the /DV3D command will slow down
        3-D displays significantly. Be sure to reapply the TRIS option after
        you obtain a satisfactory output.

        Specifying /TXTRE,DEFA removes all texturing.

        APDL Command: EORIENT

        Parameters
        ----------
        etype
            Specifies which elements to orient.

            LYSL - Specifies that certain solid elements (such as SOLID185 with KEYOPT(3) = 1,
                   SOLID186 with KEYOPT(3) = 1, and SOLSH190) will be oriented.
                   This value is the default.

        Notes
        -----
        EORIENT renumbers the element faces, designating the face  most
        parallel to the XY plane of the element coordinate system (set with
        ESYS) as face 1 (nodes I-J-K-L, parallel to the layers in layered
        elements). It calculates the outward normal of each face and changes
        the node designation  of the elements so the face with a normal most
        nearly parallel with and in the same general direction as the target
        axis becomes face 1.

        The target axis, defined by Dir, is either the negative or positive
        indicated axis or the outward normal of face 1 of that element.

        All SOLID185 Layered Structural Solid, SOLID186 Layered Structural
        Solid, and SOLSH190 solid shell elements in the selected set are
        considered for reorientation.

        After reorienting elements, you should always display and graphically
        review results using the /ESHAPE command. When plotting models with
        many or symmetric layers, it may be useful to temporarily reduce the
        number of layers to two, with one layer being much thicker than the
        other.

        You cannot use EORIENT to change the normal direction of any element
        that has a body or surface load.  We recommend that you apply all of
        your loads only after ensuring that the element normal directions are
        acceptable.

        Prisms and tetrahedrals are also supported, within the current
        limitations of the SOLID185, SOLID186, and SOLSH190 elements. (Layers
        parallel to the four-node face of the prism are not supported.)

        Selects lines based on values of a labeled item and component.  For
        example, to select a new set of lines based on line numbers 1 through
        7, use LSEL,S,LINE,,1,7.  The subset is used when the ALL label is
        entered (or implied) on other commands, such as LLIST,ALL.  Only data
        identified by line number are selected.  Data are flagged as selected
        and unselected; no data are actually deleted from the database.

        If Item = LCCA, the command selects only those lines that were created

        For selects based on non-integer numbers (e.g. coordinates, results,

        This command is typically used when VMAX-VMIN is very large so that the
        computed default tolerance is therefore large and the xSEL commands
        selects more than what is desired.

        Toler remains active until respecified by a subsequent SELTOL command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inumb
            Interface number for load transfer. The interface number
            corresponds to the interface number specified by the volume flag

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        The ANSYS Multi-field solver solver does not allow you to switch the
        load transfer direction for the same load quantity across the same
        interfaces for a restart run. For example, if Field1 sends temperature
        to and receives heat flow from Field2 across Interface 1 in a previous
        solution, then you cannot make Field1 send heat flow to and receive
        temperatures from Field2 across the same interface in a restart run,
        even if you cleared the corresponding load transfer command.

        Operates on one input array parameter vector and produces one output
        array parameter vector according to:

        ParR = f(Par1)

        where the functions (f) are described below.  Functions are based on
        the standard FORTRAN definitions where possible.  Out-of-range function
        results (or results with exponents whose magnitudes are approximately
        greater than 32 or less than -32) produce a zero value.  Input and
        output for angular functions may be radians (default) or degrees
        [*AFUN].  ParR may be the same as Par1.  Starting array element numbers
        must be defined for each array parameter vector if it does not start at
        the first location. For example, *VFUN,A,SQRT,B(5) takes the square
        root of the fifth element of B and stores the result in the first
        element of A.  Operations continue on successive array elements [*VLEN,

        APDL Command: RMNDISP

        Extracts neutral plane displacements from a test load or element load
        solution for the ROM method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loadt
            Load type. Load type must be an alphanumeric string enclosed in
            single quotes. Valid load types are 'TLOAD' for the test load and
            'ELOAD' for the element load.

        loc
            Determines whether file will be overwritten or appended. Valid
            labels are 'WRITE' or 'APPEND'. Defaults to 'WRITE' for test load.

        Notes
        -----
        This command extracts the displacements at a neutral plane of a model.
        If  LoadT = 'TLOAD', extract displacements for a test load on a
        structure that represents the expected deflection state.  A test load
        is used to assist in the automatic mode selection for the ROM mode
        characterization. If LoadT = 'ELOAD', extract the neutral plane
        displacements for an element load that will be used in the use pass of
        a ROM analysis.  Typical element loads are gravity, and pressure
        loading. The element loads may be scaled [RMLVSCALE] during the use
        pass.

        The command requires a node component named "NEUN" to be defined. These
        nodes represent the nodes at the neutral plane of a structure (in the
        case of a stress-stiffened structure), or at any plane in the structure
        (non stress-stiffened case).

        For LoadT = 'TLOAD', node displacements are written to the file
        jobname.tld.  For LoadT = 'ELOAD', node displacements are written to
        the file jobname.eld. Up to 5 element load cases may be written to the
        file jobname.eld.

        APDL Command: LMATRIX

        Calculates an inductance matrix and the total flux linkage for an
        N-winding coil system.

        Parameters
        ----------
        symfac
            Geometric symmetry factor.  Inductance terms are scaled by this
            factor which represents the fraction of the total device modeled.
            Default is 1.

        coilname
            Alphanumeric prefix identifier for coil label used in defining
            named element coil components. Default is 'coil.'

        curname
            Name of a predefined parameter array containing the nominal coil
            currents of the system.  The array must be defined (see *DIM
            command) prior to calling the LMATRIX macro. Default is 'cur.'

        indname
            Name of the array parameter to be created by LMATRIX containing the
            calculated inductance matrix and the flux linkage in each coil.  A
            text file of the same name with an extension .TXT is created
            containing the matrix data. Default is 'lmatrix.'

        Notes
        -----
        LMATRIX calculates the differential inductance matrix for an N-winding
        system where N is the number of coils in the system, and calculates the
        total flux linkage in each coil. LMATRIX may only be executed after the
        solution of a problem with nominal currents applied to the coils at a
        desired “operating point.” The array Indname has N rows and N+1
        columns. The N x N block is the differential inductance matrix; the
        N+1th column contains the total flux linkage, with the ith row
        corresponding to the ith coil. See the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference
        for more details.

        To invoke the LMATRIX macro, for the classical formulations, the
        elements for each coil must be grouped into a component using the CM
        command.  Each set of independent coil elements is assigned a component
        name with the prefix Coilname followed by the coil number. For the
        solenoidal formulations, you must make the exciting node with a F,AMPS
        load a node component using the CM command.  The classical and
        solenoidal formulations cannot be mixed.

        To invoke the LMATRIX macro, the vector array parameter Curname with
        dimension N must be defined and named using the *DIM command.  You must
        set each vector array entry equal to the nominal current per turn in
        the corresponding coil at the operating point.  Zero current values
        must be approximated by a negligibly small applied current.

        Do not apply (or remove) inhomogeneous loads before using the LMATRIX
        command. Inhomogeneous loads are those created by:

        Degree of freedom commands (D, DA, etc.) specifying nonzero degrees of
        freedom values on nodes or solid model entities

        Any CE command with a nonzero constant term

        Do not put any loads (for example, current) on elements not contained
        in the element component.

        Operating solutions must be obtained through static analysis before
        calling LMATRIX. All name-strings must be enclosed in single quotes in
        the LMATRIX command line. The geometric symmetry factor, Symfac,
        represents the fraction of the device modeled, disregarding any current
        source primitives.

        LMATRIX works only with magnetic field elements: PLANE53, SOLID96, and
        SOLID97, and with SOURC36 solenoidal formulations. For electromagnetic
        elements PLANE233, SOLID236 and SOLID237, static linear perturbation
        analysis can be used to calculate the differential inductance using the
        element incremental energy record (IENE).

        For more information, see LMATRIX in the Low-Frequency Electromagnetic
        Analysis Guide.

        A counterclockwise ordering of nodes on the PPATH command will give the

        stress tensor approach.  The macro is valid for 2-D planar or

            The number must be between 1 and 500. Defaults to 20. If NPTS = 0

            Do this generation operation a total of ITIMEs, incrementing all
            nodes in the given pattern by NINC each time after the first. ITIME
            must be > 1 if generation is to occur. NINC may be positive, zero,
            or negative.

        iel1, iel2, ieinc
            Generate elements from the pattern that begins with IEL1 to IEL2
            (defaults to IEL1) in steps of IEINC (defaults to 1). If IEL1 is
            negative, IEL2 and IEINC are ignored and use the last |IEL1|
            elements (in sequence backward from the maximum element number) as

            component name may also be substituted for IEL1 (IEL2 and IEINC are
            ignored).

        minc
            Increment material number of all elements in the given pattern by
            MINC each time after the first.

        tinc

        cinc
            Increment element coordinate system number by CINC.

        sinc
            Increment section ID number by SINC.

        dx, dy, dz
            Define nodes that do not already exist but are needed by generated
            elements (NGEN,ITIME,INC,NODE1,,,DX,DY,DZ). Zero is a valid value.

        Used to define the transient integration parameters.  For more
        information on transient integration parameters, refer to the
        Mechanical APDL Theory Reference.

        For structural transient analyses, you may choose between the Newmark
        and HHT time integration methods (see the TRNOPT command). In this
        case, if GAMMA is input and the integration parameters ALPHA, DELTA,
        ALPHAF, and ALPHAM are left blank, the program will calculate the
        integration parameters. Alternatively, you can input these integration
        parameters directly on this command. However, for the unconditional
        stability and second order accuracy of the time integration, these
        parameters should satisfy a specific relationship, as described in
        Description of Structural and Other Second Order Systems of the
        Mechanical APDL Theory Reference.

         In a transient piezoelectric analysis, required input for this command
        is ALPHA = 0.25, DELTA = 0.5, and THETA = 0.5.  For a coupled
        electromagnetic-circuit transient analysis, use THETA = 1.0, the

        Parameters

        nl1, nl2, ninc
            Lines (NL1 to NL2 in increments of NINC) around which the mesh is
            to be refined.  NL2 defaults to NL1, and NINC defaults to 1.  If

            component name may also be substituted for NL1 (NL2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of the number of elements outward
            from the indicated lines (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        LREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified lines. By
        default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements with
        1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        LREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified lines. Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified lines, but are not tetrahedra (for example,
        hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements. This applies to

                   ANGX, ANGY, ANGZ to specify the rotational velocity and the
                   axis of rotation.

            VELO - Define initial velocity based on translational velocities and nodal rotational
                   velocities input relative to the global Cartesian axes. For
                   this option, use the following fields to define the initial
                   velocity: VX, VY, VZ, OMEGAX, OMEGAY, OMEGAZ.

            LIST - List initial velocity for the component or node specified by Cname. If Cname is
                   blank, all initial velocities defined on nodes and node
                   components are listed. Remaining fields are ignored for this
                   option.

            DELE - Delete initial velocity defined for the component or node specified by Cname.
                   If Cname is blank, all initial velocities defined on nodes
                   and node components are deleted. Remaining fields are
                   ignored for this option.

        cname
            Name of existing component [CM] or node number to which the initial
            velocity is to be applied. If a component is used, it must consist
            of nodes.

        vx
            Initial velocity in X direction. Defaults to 0.

        vy
            Initial velocity in Y direction. Defaults to 0.

        vz
            Initial velocity in Z direction. Defaults to 0.

        omegax
            For Option = VGEN, OMEGAX is the initial rotational velocity of the
            component (or node) about the specified rotational axis. For Option
            = VELO, OMEGAX is the initial nodal rotational velocity about the
            X-axis. OMEGAX defaults to 0.

        omegay
            Initial nodal rotational velocity about the Y-axis (used only if
            Option = VELO). Defaults to 0.

        omegaz
            Initial nodal rotational velocity about the Z-axis (used only if
            Option = VELO). Defaults to 0.

        Notes
        -----
        You cannot mix the two methods of initial velocity input (Option = VELO
        and Option = VGEN) in the same analysis. You must use only one method
        for all initial velocity definitions.

        The VGEN and VELO methods differ in how the rotational velocity is
        defined. Use Option = VGEN to input the initial velocities of a
        rotating component. Use Option = VELO to apply the rotations directly
        to the nodes' rotation degrees of freedom. Since only shell and beam
        elements have rotation degrees of freedom, the rotations input with
        Option = VELO are only applicable to SHELL163 and BEAM161 elements. The
        rotational velocities input with Option = VELO are ignored for nodes
        not having rotational degrees of freedom (such as nodes attached to a
        SOLID164 or SOLID168 element).

        It is normally acceptable to mix nodes belonging to deformable bodies
        and rigid bodies in the nodal component used in an initial velocity
        definition. However, when defining initial velocities in an implicit-
        to-explicit sequential solution, this is not an acceptable practice. In
        order for the initial velocities to be defined correctly in this type
        of analysis, you must define the initial velocities on the deformable
        body nodes separately from the initial velocities on the rigid body
        nodes.

        Issuing the EDVEL command again for the same component or node (Cname)
        will overwrite previous initial velocities defined for that component
        or node.

        To set the initial velocities to zero, issue the EDVEL command with
        only the Option (use VELO or VGEN) and Cname fields specified.

        In a small restart analysis (EDSTART,2), you can only use the Option =
        VELO method to change initial velocities. When used in a small restart,
        the command EDVEL,VELO changes the velocity of the specified nodes. If
        you don't change the velocity of the nodes, their velocity at the
        beginning of the restart will be the same as the velocity at the end of
        the previous analysis.

        Except for the LIST option, the EDVEL command is not supported in a
        full restart analysis (EDSTART,3). You can list initial velocities
        defined in the previous analysis with the command EDVEL,LIST. However,
        you cannot change initial velocities for nodes or node components that
        existed in the previous analysis; their velocity at the beginning of
        the analysis will be the same as the velocity at the end of the
        previous analysis. In addition, you cannot define initial velocities
        for any nodes that are added in the full restart; the velocity of new
        nodes will be zero.

        To apply initial velocities to parts or part assemblies, use the EDPVEL
        command.

        You can use EDPVEL and EDVEL in the same analysis. If a node or node
        component input on the EDVEL command shares common nodes with a part or
        part assembly input on the EDPVEL command, the initial velocities
        defined on the common nodes will be determined by the last command
        input.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        APDL Command: PDCFLD

        Calculates a correlation field and stores it into an ANSYS array.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parr
            Parameter name. ParR is a one-dimensional array with the dimension
            N * (N - 1)/2, where N is either the number of the selected nodes
            or the number of the selected elements (depending on the Entity
            field). The PDCFLD command automatically sets ParR as a one-
            dimensional array, (so you do not have to use the *DIM command). If
            you use the PDCFLD command twice with the ANSYS parameter ParR,
            then the values stored in the array are automatically overwritten.
            If the number of selected FE entities is different from the
            previous PDCFLD command, then the array ParR is re-dimensioned
            automatically.

        entity
            Specifies which FE entity the calculation of the correlation field
            is based on. This field must not be blank.

            NODE - Calculate the correlation coefficients based on the distance between the
                   selected nodes.

            ELEM - Calculate the correlation coefficients based on the distance between the
                   centroids of the selected elements.

        ctype
            Specifies the equation used to calculate the correlation
            coefficients as a function of the nodal or element centroid
            distances. This field must not be blank.

            NONE - The random field is not correlated. This means the correlation coefficients are
                   determined according to

            ρij = 1 for i = j - ρij = 0 for i ≠ j

            Here, ρij is the correlation coefficient between the i-th and j-th selected FE entity (node or element centroid). - LEXP

            Calculate the correlation coefficient according to a linear-exponential decay function. - Here, D({xi} , {xj}) is the “domain distance” between {xi}, {xj}, and {xi} and
                              {xj} are the coordinate vectors of the i-th and
                              j-th selected FE entity (node or element
                              centroid), and CL is the correlation length of
                              the random field as specified in the CLENGTH
                              field.

        clength
            Correlation length of the correlation field. The correlation length
            is a characteristic length that influences how strongly two
            elements of a random field are correlated with each other. The
            larger the value of CLENGTH, the stronger the correlation between
            the random field elements. CLENGTH is required for Ctype = LEXP and
            Ctype = QEXP; it must be a nonzero, positive number.

        Notes
        -----
        Calculates a correlation field for a probabilistic analysis involving a
        random field. Random fields are random effects with a spatial
        distribution; the value of a random field not only varies from
        simulation to simulation at any given location, but also from location
        to location. The correlation field describes the correlation
        coefficient between two different spatial locations. Random fields can
        be either based on element properties (typically material) or nodal
        properties (typically surface shape defined by nodal coordinates).
        Hence, random fields are either associated with the selected nodes or
        the selected elements. If a random field is associated with elements,
        then the correlation coefficients of the random field are calculated
        based on the distance of the element centroids.

        For more information, see Probabilistic Design in the Advanced Analysis
        Guide.

        Note that for correlation fields, the “domain distance” D({xi} , {xj})
        is not the spatial distance |{xi} - {xj}|, but the length of a path
        between {xi} and {xj} that always remains inside the finite element
        domain. However, exceptions are possible in extreme meshing cases. For
        elements that share at least one node, the PDCFLD evaluates the
        distance by directly connecting the element centroids with a straight
        line. If these neighboring elements form a sharp inward corner then it
        is possible that the “domain distance” path lies partly outside the
        finite element domain, as illustrated below.

        After the correlation coefficients have been calculated and stored in
        the ANSYS parameter ParR, then use the PDCORR command to define the
        correlations between the elements of the random field.

        The macro loops through a series of load step files written by the
        LSWRITE command.  The macro file called by LSSOLVE is called
        LSSOLVE.MAC.

        LSSOLVE cannot be used with the birth-death option.

        LSSOLVE is not supported for cyclic symmetry analyses.

        LSSOLVE does not support restarts.

        APDL Command: IOPTN

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Label identifying the import option.  The meaning of VAL1 varies
            depending on Lab.

            STAT - List overall status of import facilities, including current option values.
                   VAL1 is ignored.

            DEFA - Set default values for all import options.  VAL1is ignored.

            MERG - Entity merge option.  VAL1 can be:

            YES - Automatic merging is performed (default).

            NO - No merging of entities.

            SOLID - Solid option.  VAL1 can be:

            YES - Solid is created automatically (default).

            NO - No solid created.

            GTOLER - Entity merging tolerance. If IGES = SMOOTH, the GTOLER,VAL1 can be:

            DEFA - Use system defaults (default).

            FILE - Use tolerance from the imported file.

            n - A user-specified tolerance value.

            IGES - IGES import option.  VAL1 can be:

            STAT - List status of IGES related options in the output window.

            SMOOTH (or RV52) - Use more robust IGES revision 5.2 import function (default).

            SMALL - Small areas option.   VAL1 can be:

            YES - Small areas are deleted (default).

            NO - Small areas are retained.

        val1
            Additional input value as described under each Lab option.

        Notes
        -----
        Controls various options during a model file transfer.  A global solid
        model tolerance (GTOLER) can be specified.

        The SMALL,YES option (default) delete small areas  and can cause
        geometrical inconsistencies that could cause the import process to
        abort.  Retaining the small areas increases processor time and memory
        usage.

        The data is stored in the standard ANSYS graphics database.

        The IGES,SMOOTH (default) option is capable of reading in any rational
        B-spline curve entity (type 126), or rational B-spline surface entity
        (type 128) with a degree less than or equal to 20.  Attempts to read in
        B-spline curve or surface entities of degree higher than 20 may result
        in error messages.

        If you issue the /CLEAR command, the IOPTN settings return to their
        defaults.

        For MERG,YES, merging of coincident geometry items is performed
        automatically when the IGESIN command is issued (that is, an internal
        NUMMRG,KP command is issued).  The model is merged with the
        consideration tolerance (TOLER on NUMMRG) set equal to 0.75 * the
        shortest distance between the endpoints of any active line. See the
        NUMMRG command for more information about the tolerances. In most
        cases, the default merging is appropriate.  Use the IOPTN command when
        you want to:

        Disable merging operations.

        Override the default merging and specify a global solid model tolerance
        value (GTOLER).

        Disable the automatic creation of solids (SOLID).

        The IOPTN command should be issued before the IGESIN command. You
        cannot change these options after your model has been imported or
        created. If you must change the options:

        Clear the database (/CLEAR) or exit and restart the program.

        Set the correct options.

        Reimport or recreate the model.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        APDL Command: APPEND

        Reads data from the results file and appends it to the database.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lstep
            Load step number of the data set to be read.  Defaults to 1.  If
            FIRST, ignore SBSTEP and TIME and read the first data set.  If
            LAST, ignore SBSTEP and TIME and read the last data set.  If NEXT,
            ignore SBSTEP and TIME and read the next data set.  If already at
            the last data set, the next set is the first data set.  If NEAR,
            ignore SBSTEP and read the data set nearest to TIME.  If TIME is
            blank, read the first data set.  If LIST, scan the results file to
            produce a summary of each load step (FACT, KIMG, TIME  and ANGLE
            are ignored).

        sbstep
            Substep number (within LSTEP) (defaults to last substep of load
            step).   For the Buckling (ANTYPE,BUCKLE) or Modal (ANTYPE,MODAL)
            analysis, the substep corresponds to the mode number (defaults to
            first mode).  If LSTEP = LIST, SBSTEP = 0 or 1 will list the basic
            load step information;  SBSTEP = 2 will also list the load step
            title, and label the imaginary data sets if they exist.

        fact
            Scale factor applied to data read from the file.  If zero (or
            blank), a value of 1.0 is used.  Harmonic velocities or
            accelerations may be calculated from the displacement results from
            a modal or harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC) analyses.  If FACT = VELO, the
            harmonic velocities (v) are calculated from the displacements (d)
            at a particular frequency (f) according to the relationship v =
            2 πfd.  Similarly, if FACT = ACEL, the harmonic accelerations (a)
            are calculated as a = (2 πf)2d.

        kimg
            Used only with results from complex analyses:

            0 - Store real part of complex solution.

            1 - Store imaginary part.

        time
            Time-point identifying the data set to be read.  For harmonic
            analyses, time corresponds to the frequency.  For the buckling
            analysis, time corresponds to the load factor.  Used only in the
            following cases:  If LSTEP is NEAR, read the data set nearest to
            TIME.   If both LSTEP and SBSTEP are zero (or blank), read data set
            at time = TIME.  If TIME is between two solution time points on the
            results file, a linear interpolation is done between the two data
            sets.  Solution items not written to the results file [OUTRES] for
            either data set will result in a null item after data set
            interpolation.  If TIME is beyond the last time point on the file,
            the last time point is used.

        angle
            Circumferential location (0° to 360°).  Defines the circumferential
            location for the harmonic calculations used when reading from the
            results file.  The harmonic factor (based on the circumferential
            angle) is applied to the harmonic elements (PLANE25, PLANE75,
            PLANE78, PLANE83, and SHELL61) of the load case.  See the
            Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for details.  Note that factored
            values of applied constraints and loads will overwrite any values
            existing in the database.

        nset
            Data set number of the data set to be read.  If a positive value
            for NSET is entered, LSTEP, SBSTEP, KIMG, and TIME are ignored.
            Available set numbers can be determined by APPEND,LIST.  To
            determine if data sets are real or imaginary, issue APPEND,LIST,2
            which labels imaginary data sets.

        Notes
        -----
        Reads a data set from the results file and appends it to the existing
        data in the database for the selected model only.  The existing
        database is not cleared (or overwritten in total), allowing the
        requested results data to be merged into the database.  Various
        operations may also be performed during the read operation.  The

        flow in a flowing fluid or charged particle motion in an electric or

        sequence by issuing the ANIM command.  This command is functional only
        in the Postprocessor.

        The TIME option lets you set the time interval of forward travel for
        the trace.  The SPACING option is used to define the particle spacing
        in seconds from adjacent particles in the stream line.  The SIZE
        variable sets the radius of the particle.  The LENGTH variable is used
        to define the particle length fraction.  By default, the LENGTH is set
        to .1, which means the particle occupies 10% of the flow region and the
        other 90% is a color-code line.  The SPACING and LENGTH variables only
        make sense when the SIZE variable is nonzero (i.e., the particle is
        bigger than the line).

            want to convert.  This argument is required.

        ename2
            Name (or the number) of the 10-node tetrahedron element to which
            you want to convert the ENAME  elements.  This argument is
            required.

        etype2
            Element TYPE reference number for ENAME2.  If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not
            specified, the program selects the element TYPE reference number
            for ENAME2.  See the "Notes" section for details.  This argument is
            optional.

        Notes
        -----
        The TCHG command allows you to specify conversion of any selected
        20-node brick that is degenerated into a tetrahedron to a 10-node
        tetrahedron.

        The TCHG command is useful when used in with the MOPT,PYRA command.
        Twenty-node pyramid shaped elements may be used in the same volume with
        10-node tetrahedra.

        Performing a conversion is likely to create circumstances in which more
        than one element type is defined for a single volume.

        If specified, ETYPE2 will usually be the same as the local element TYPE
        number (ET,ITYPE) that was assigned to ENAME2 with the ET command.  You
        can specify a unique number for ETYPE2 if you prefer.  Although ETYPE2
        is optional, it may be useful when two or more ITYPEs have been
        assigned to the same element (for example, if two SOLID187 elements
        have been established in the element attribute tables for the current
        model, use the ETYPE2 argument to distinguish between them).  If ETYPE2
        is nonzero and it has not already been assigned to an element via ET,
        the program assigns the ETYPE2 value to ENAME2 as its element TYPE
        reference number.

        If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not specified, the program determines the element
        TYPE reference number for ENAME2 in one of these ways:

        If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not specified, and ENAME2 does not appear in the
        element attribute tables, the program uses the next available (unused)
        location in the element attribute tables to determine the element TYPE
        reference number for ENAME2.

        If ETYPE2 is 0 or is not specified, and ENAME2 appears in the element
        attribute tables, the program uses ENAME2 's existing element TYPE
        reference number for ETYPE2 .  (If there is more than one occurrence of
        ENAME2 in the element attribute tables (each with its own TYPE
        reference number), the program uses the first ENAME2 reference number
        for ETYPE2 .)

        You cannot use element conversion if boundary conditions or loads are
        applied directly to any selected elements.

        see Meshing Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide

        Notes
        -----
        The output from this command consists of the comment string.  This

        substitution.

        Another way to include a comment is to precede it with a ! character
        (on the same line).  The ! may be placed anywhere on the line, and any
        input following it is ignored as a comment.  No output is produced by
        such a comment, but the comment line is included on the log file.  This

        Parameters
        ----------
        kywrd
            Specifies various PNG file export options.

            COMP - If Kywrd = COMP, then OPT is either ON or OFF (blank is interpreted as OFF).
                   This option allows you to turn PNG file compression ON or
                   OFF. If OPT = ON, then The VAL field is read to determine
                   the degree of compression. See the VALUE argument for
                   acceptable compression values.

            ORIENT - If Kywrd = ORIENT, then OPT will determine the orientation of the entire plot.
                     OPT can be either Horizontal (default) or Vertical.

            COLOR - If Kywrd = COLOR, then OPT will determine the color depth of the saved file.
                    OPT can be 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to Black and White,
                    Grayscale, and Color (default), respectively.

            TMOD - If Kywrd = TMOD, then OPT will determine the text method. OPT can be either 1
                   or 0, corresponding to bitmap text (default) or line stroke
                   text, respectively.

            DEFAULT - If Kywrd = DEFAULT, then all of the default values, for all of the Kywrd
                      parameters listed above, are active.

            STAT - Shows the current status of PNG file export.

        opt
            OPT can have the following names or values, depending on the value
            for Kywrd (see above).

            ON, OFF - If Kywrd = COMP, the values On and Off control the use of compression. The
                      degree of compression is determined by VAL

            Horizontal, Vertical - If Kywrd = ORIENT, the terms Horizontal or Vertical determine the orientation
                              of the plot.

            0, 1, 2 - If Kywrd = COLOR, the numbers 0, 1, and 2 correspond to Black and White,
                      Grayscale and Color, respectively.

            1, 0 - If Kywrd = TMOD, the values 1 and 0 determine whether bitmap (1) or stroke text
                   (0) fonts will be used

        val
            VAL is active only when Kywrd = COMP, and determines the degree of
            compression applied to the exported file (see above).

            1  - Apply the default, optimum value for compression. This value represents the
                 best combination of speed and compression. It varies according
                 to the release level of the ZLIB compression package.

            1-9  - Use this value to specify a specific compression level. 1 is the lowest
                   compression level (fastest) and 9 is the highest compression
                   level (slowest).

            Reference number of coordinate system where the pattern is to be

        nv1, nv2, ninc
            Transfer volumes from pattern beginning with NV1 to NV2 (defaults
            to NV1) in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).  If NV1 = ALL, NV2 and

        noelem
            Specifies whether elements and nodes are also to be generated:

        rlab
            Result set label. Identifies the result set to be used for
            postprocessing. A result set label can be the solution set label
            you defined in a PDEXE command (if you are directly postprocessing
            Monte Carlo Simulation results), or the response surface set label
            defined in an RSFIT command (for Response Surface Analyses).

        name
            Parameter name. The parameter must have been previously defined as

            command.

        type
            Type of cumulative distribution curve to be displayed.

            EMP - Show an empirical cumulative distribution curve.

            GAUS - Show a cumulative distribution curve in a normal distribution plot. A random
                   variable based on a normal or Gaussian distribution appears
                   as a straight line in this type of plot.

            LOGN - Show a cumulative distribution curve in a log-normal plot. A random variable
                   based on a log-normal distribution appears as a straight
                   line in this type of plot.

                   variable based on a Weibull distribution appears as a
                   straight line in this type of plot.

        conf
            Confidence level. The confidence level is used to plot confidence
            bounds around the cumulative distribution function. The value for
            the confidence level must be between 0.0 and 1.0 and it defaults to
            0.95 (95%). Plotting of the confidence bound is suppressed for CONF
            0.5. This parameter is ignored for the postprocessing of response
            surface methods results.

        nmax
            Maximum number of points to be plotted for the distribution curve.
            This must be a positive number and it defaults to 100. If the
            sample size is less than NMAX, all sample data is represented in
            the plot. If the sample size is larger than NMAX, the probabilistic

        Turns on automatic scaling of the entire mass matrix and frequency

        Supernode mode extraction method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scaling


            Off  - Do not use automatic scaling of the mass matrix and frequency range.

            On  - Use automatic scaling of the mass matrix and frequency range.

        Notes
        -----
        Use this command to deactivate or force activation of automatic scaling
        of the entire mass matrix and frequency range for modal analyses where
        the entire mass matrix is significantly different (i.e., orders of
        magnitude difference) than the entire stiffness matrix (for example,
        due to the particular unit system being used).  Where the mass matrix
        is significantly smaller compared to the stiffness matrix, the
        eigenvalues will tend to approach very large numbers (>10e12), making
        the Block Lanczos, PCG Lanczos, or Supernode mode extraction method
        less efficient and more likely to miss modes.

        ANSYS uses scaling (if appropriate) by default. However, you can issue
        FRQSCL,ON to force the entire mass matrix and frequency range to be
        scaled to bring the stiffness and mass matrices closer together in
        terms of orders of magnitude, improving efficiency and reducing the
        likelihood of missed modes.  The resulting eigenvalues are then
        automatically scaled back to the original system. If you are using
        micro MKS units, where the density is typically very small compared to
        the stiffness, you may want to issue FRQSCL,ON to force scaling on.

        If the stiffness and mass are on the same scale, FRQSCL,ON has no
        effect.

        This command is available only for modal analyses using the Block
        Lanczos, PCG Lanczos, or Supernode mode extraction method (MODOPT,LANB,

        Notes
        -----
        Use of the LGLUE command generates new lines by "gluing" input lines.
        The glue operation redefines the input lines so that they share
        keypoints at their common ends.  The new lines encompass the same
        geometry as the original lines.  This operation is only valid if the

        first location. For example, *MFUN,A(1,5),COPY,B(2,3) copies matrix B
        (starting at element (2,3)) to matrix A (starting at element (1,5)).
        The diagonal corner elements for each submatrix must be defined: the
        upper left corner by the array starting element (on this command), the
        lower right corner by the current values from the *VCOL and *VLEN

        Transfers a pattern of nodes from one coordinate system to another.

        other.  Initial pattern may be generated in any coordinate system.
        Coordinate values are interpreted in the active coordinate system and
        are transferred directly.

        A model generated in one coordinate system may be transferred to
        another coordinate system.  The user may define several coordinate
        systems (translated and rotated from each other), generate a model in
        one coordinate system, and then repeatedly transfer the model to other
        coordinate systems.  The model may be generated in any type of
        coordinate system (Cartesian, cylindrical, etc.) and transferred to any
        other type of coordinate system.  Coordinate values (X, Y, Z, or R,: θ,
        Z, or etc.) of the model being transferred are interpreted in the
        active coordinate system type, regardless of how they were generated.
        Values are transferred directly and are interpreted according to the
        type of coordinate system being transferred to.  For example,
        transferring from a Cartesian coordinate system to a cylindrical
        coordinate system (not recommended) would cause X = 2.0 and Y = 3.0

        This command macro is used to generate surface effect elements overlaid
        on the surface of existing  solid elements and, based on proximity, to
        determine and assign the extra node for each surface element.  The
        underlying volumes of the solid region and the fluid lines must be
        meshed prior to calling this command macro. The active element type
        must be SURF152 with appropriate settings for KEYOPT(4), KEYOPT(5),
        KEYOPT(6), and KEYOPT(8).

        The surface areas of the solid and the target lines of the fluid are
        grouped into components and named using the CM command.  The names must
        be enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'SAREA') when the AFSURF command is
        manually typed in.

        When using the GUI method, node and element components are created

            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you

            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

            Directory path (64 characters maximum). Defaults to current

            A value indicating either a line number in the file or a user-
            defined label in the file from which to begin reading the input
            file.

            (blank), 0, or 1 - Begins reading from the top of the file (default).

                     maximum).

        log
            Indicates whether secondary input from this command should be

            0 - Record only the /INPUT command on the log (default).

            1 - Record commands in the specified secondary file as they are executed.

        Notes
        -----
        Switches the input file for the next commands.  Commands are read from
        this file until an end-of-file or another file switching directive is
        read.  An end-of-file occurs after the last record of the file or when
        a /EOF command is read.  An automatic switch back one level (to the
        previous file) occurs when an end-of-file is encountered.  Twenty
        levels of nested file switching are allowed.  Note that files including
        *DO, *USE, *ULIB, and the "Unknown Command" Macro have less nesting
        available because each of these operations also uses a level of file
        switching.  For an interactive run, a /INPUT,TERM switches to the
        terminal for the next input.  A /EOF read from the terminal then
        switches back to the previous file.  A /INPUT (with a blank second
        field) switches back to the primary input file.

        Setting LOG = 1 on /INPUT causes all commands read from the specified
        file to be recorded in the command log (File.LOG) and the internal
        database command log [LGWRITE].  This option is recommended if the log
        file will be used later .  The LOG = 1 option is only valid when the
        /INPUT occurs in the primary input file.  Using LOG = 1 on a nested
        /INPUT or on a /INPUT within a do-loop will have no effect (i.e.,
        commands in the secondary input file are not written to the command
        log).

        The Dir option is optional as the directory path can be included
        directly in Fname.

        angle
            Largest angle between two faces for which the faces are considered
            to be coplanar (0° to 180°). Defaults to 45°. A smaller angle
            produces more edges, a larger angle produces fewer edges.

        Notes
        -----
        The ANGLE field is used in PowerGraphics to determine geometric
        discontinuities. It is a tolerance measure for the differences between
        the normals of the surfaces being considered. Values within the
        tolerance are accepted as coplanar (geometrically continuous). In
        postprocessing displays, results are not averaged across discontinuous
        surfaces.

        A surface can be displayed as an edge outline without interior detail.
        This is useful for both geometry and postprocessing displays. Element
        outlines are normally shown as solid lines for geometry and
        displacement displays. Lines common to adjacent "coplanar" element
        faces are removed from the display.  Midside nodes of elements are

        rmshky
            Remesh flag option:

            0 - Remesh the selected non-structural volumes only if mesh morphing fails.

            1 - Remesh the selected non-structural volumes and bypass mesh morphing.

            2 - Perform mesh morphing only and do not remesh.

        Notes
        -----
        The selected volumes should include only non-structural regions
        adjacent to structural regions. DVMORPH will morph the non-structural
        volumes to coincide with the deflections of the structural regions.

        Nodes in the structural regions move in accordance with computed
        displacements. Displacements from a structural analysis must be in the
        database prior to issuing DVMORPH.

        By default, nodes attached to areas can move along the areas. You can
        use XAREA to restrain nodes on certain areas.

        By default (RMSHKY = 0), DVMORPH will remesh the selected non-
        structural volumes entirely if a satisfactory morphed mesh cannot be
        provided.

        If boundary conditions and loads are applied directly to nodes and
        elements, the DVMORPH command requires that these be removed before
        remeshing can take place.

        Exercise care with initial conditions defined by the IC command. Before
        a structural analysis is performed for a sequentially coupled analysis,
        the DVMORPH command requires that initial conditions be removed from
        all null element type nodes in the non-structural regions. Use ICDELE

        Notes
        -----
        For elements SOLID236 and SOLID237, if Lab = AZ and Value1 = 0, this
        sets the flux-parallel condition for the edge formulation.  (A flux-
        normal condition is the natural boundary condition.)  Do not use the DA
        command to set the edge-flux DOF, AZ to a nonzero value.

        If Lab = MAG and Value1 = 0, this sets the flux-normal condition for
        the magnetic scalar potential formulations (MSP) (A flux-parallel
        condition is the natural boundary condition for MSP.)

        If Lab = VOLT and Value1 = 0, the J-normal condition is set (current
        density (J) flow normal to the area). (A J-parallel condition is the
        natural boundary condition.)

        You can transfer constraints from areas to nodes with the DTRAN or
        SBCTRAN commands.  See the DK command for information about generating
        other constraints on areas.

        Symmetry and antisymmetry constraints are generated as described for

        APDL Command: *VPLOT

        Graphs columns (vectors) of array parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parx
            Name of the array parameter whose column vector values will be the
            abscissa of the graph.  If blank, row subscript numbers are used
            instead.  ParX is not sorted by the program.

        pary
            Name of the array parameter whose column vector values will be
            graphed against the ParX values.

        y2, y3, y4, . . . , y8
            Additional column subscript of the ParY array parameter whose
            values are to be graphed against the ParX values.

        Notes
        -----
        The column to be graphed and the starting row for each array parameter
        must be specified as subscripts.  Additional columns of the ParY array
        parameter may be graphed by specifying column numbers for Y2,  Y3,
        ...,Y8.  For example, *VPLOT,TIME (4,6), DISP (8,1),2,3 specifies that
        the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns of array parameter DISP (all starting at
        row 8) are to be graphed against the 6th column of array parameter TIME
        (starting at row 4).  The columns are graphed from the starting row to
        their maximum extent.  See the *VLEN and  *VMASK commands to limit or
        skip data to be graphed.  The array parameters specified on the *VPLOT
        command must be of the same type (type ARRAY or TABLE; [*DIM].   Arrays
        of type TABLE are graphed as continuous curves.  Arrays of type ARRAY
        is displayed in bar chart fashion.

        The normal curve labeling scheme for *VPLOT is to label curve 1 “COL
        1”, curve 2 “COL 2” and so on. You can use the /GCOLUMN command to
        apply user-specified labels (8 characters maximum) to your curves. See
        Modifying Curve Labels in the ANSYS Parametric Design Language Guide
        for more information on using /GCOLUMN.

        When a graph plot reaches minimum or maximum y-axis limits, the program
        indicates the condition by clipping the graph. The clip appears as a
        horizontal magenta line. Mechanical APDL calculates y-axis limits
        automatically; however, you can modify the (YMIN and YMAX) limits via
        the /YRANGE command.

            Label identifying the symmetry plane option to be performed.

            ADD - Define a sliding or cyclic symmetry plane.

            DELE - Delete a specified sliding or cyclic symmetry plane.

            LIST - List defined sliding or cyclic symmetry planes.

        lab
            Valid boundary options for defining a symmetry plane. A valid label
            must always be specified for adding, deleting, or listing boundary
            planes.

            SLIDE - Sliding symmetry plane.

            CYCL - Cyclic symmetry plane.

        cname
            Name of existing component [CM] to which boundary symmetry is to be
            applied or deleted. Component must consist of nodes. For Option =
            LIST, a component is not required because all defined symmetry
            planes are listed for the specified Lab.  For Option = DELE, use
            Cname = ALL to delete all symmetry planes currently defined for the
            specified Lab.

        xc, yc, zc
            X, Y, and Z coordinates of the head of the vector defining normal
            (Lab = SLIDE) or axis of rotation (Lab = CYCL). The tail of the
            vector is at the global origin.

        cname2
            Name of existing nodal component [CM] for which second cyclic
            boundary plane is to be applied. Each node in Cname2 component is
            constrained to a corresponding node in the first component set.
            Therefore, component Cname2 must have the same number of nodes as
            the Cname component. Cname2 is valid only for Lab = CYCL.

        copt
            Specified constraint option for sliding plane symmetry. COPT is
            valid only for Lab = SLIDE. Valid COPT options are:

            0 - Nodes move on normal plane (default).

            1 - Nodes move only in vector direction.

        Notes
        -----
        For cyclic symmetry, the node numbers in component Cname2 must differ
        from the node numbers in Cname by a constant offset value. In addition,
        the nodes in Cname2 must have locations which, if given in cylindrical
        coordinates, all differ by the same angle from the nodes in Cname. The

            Lines to be concatenated.  If NL1 = ALL, NL2 is ignored and all
            selected lines [LSEL] are concatenated.  If NL1 = P, graphical
            picking is enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored
            (valid only in the GUI).  A component name may also be substituted
            for NL1 (NL2 is ignored).

        Notes
        -----
        Concatenates multiple, adjacent lines (the input lines) into one line
        (the output line) in preparation for mapped meshing.  An area that
        contains too many lines for mapped meshing can still be mapped meshed
        if some of the lines in that area are first concatenated (see Meshing
        Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing Guide for details on
        mapped meshing restrictions).

        LCCAT is meant to be used solely for meshing and cannot be used for any
        other purposes.  Specifically, (a) the output line and any areas that
        have the output line on their line list [ALIST] cannot be used as input
        to any other solid modeling operation (not even another LCCAT command);
        and (b) the output line cannot accept solid model boundary conditions
        [DL, SFL].

        The output line will take on the element divisions of the input lines
        and will not accept element divisions that are directly assigned
        [LESIZE].  The output line from the LCCAT operation will be coincident
        with the input lines and the input lines will be retained.  Consider
        the LCOMB command instead of LCCAT if you wish to delete the input
        lines and if the lines to be combined have similar slopes at the common
        keypoint(s).  When an LCCAT command is issued, area line lists [ALIST]
        that contain all of the input lines will be updated so that the area
        line lists refer to the output line instead of the input lines.
        Deletion of the output line [LDELE] effectively reverses the LCCAT
        operation and restores area line lists to their original condition.

        You can use the LSEL command to select lines that were created by
        concatenation, and then follow it with an LDELE,ALL command to delete
        them.  Also see Meshing Your Solid Model in the Modeling and Meshing

        Defines an element by its nodes and attribute values. Similar to the E
        command except it allows the element number (IEL) to be defined
        explicitly.  Element numbers need not be consecutive. Any existing
        element already having this number will be redefined.

        Up to 8 nodes may be specified with the EN command. If more nodes are
        needed for the element, use the EMORE command. The number of nodes
        required and the order in which they should be specified are described
        in the Element Reference for each element type.  The current (or
        default) MAT, TYPE, REAL, SECNUM, and ESYS attribute values are also
        assigned to the element.

        When creating elements with more than 8 nodes using this command and
        the EMORE command, it may be necessary to turn off shape checking using
        the SHPP command before issuing this command. If a valid element type
        can be created without using the additional nodes on the EMORE command,
        this command will create that element. The EMORE command will then
        modify the element to include the additional nodes. If shape checking
        is active, it will be performed before the EMORE command is issued.
        Therefore, if the shape checking limits are exceeded, element creation
        may fail before the EMORE command modifies the element into an
        acceptable shape.

            Label identifying type of select. Because PARTSEL is a command

        Notes

        PARTSEL invokes an ANSYS macro that selects parts in an explicit
        dynamic analysis. When PARTSEL is executed, an element component is
        automatically created for each existing part. For example, the elements
        that make up PART 1 are grouped into the element component _PART1. Each
        time the PARTSEL command is executed, components for unselected parts
        will be unselected. To plot selected parts, choose Utility Menu> Plot>
        Parts in the GUI or issue the command PARTSEL,'PLOT'.

        After selecting parts, if you change the selected set of nodes or
        elements and then plot parts, the nodes and elements associated with
        the previously selected parts (from the last PARTSEL command) will
        become the currently selected set.

        Note:: : A more efficient way to select and plot parts is to use the
        ESEL (with ITEM = PART) and EPLOT commands. We recommend using ESEL
        instead of PARTSEL since PARTSEL will be phased out in a future
        release. Note that the menu path mentioned above for plotting parts
        does not work with the ESEL command; use Utility Menu> Plot> Elements
        instead.

        In an explicit dynamic small restart analysis (EDSTART,2), PARTSEL can
        be used to unselect a part during the solution even if it is referenced
        in some way (such as in a contact definition). (Note that ESEL cannot
        be used for this purpose.) However, in a new analysis or a full restart
        analysis (EDSTART,3), all parts that are used in some type of
        definition must be selected at the time of solution.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Plots the distribution of a defined random input variable. The PDPLOT
        command generates a probability density function plot as well as a
        cumulative distribution function plot of the random variable. The
        probabilities PLOW and PUP are used to determine the plot range of the
        random input variable values. To do this, the probabilities are
        converted into random input variable values using the inverse
        cumulative distribution function of the random input variable as shown
        in the following illustration.

        Using the probabilities ensures that the boundaries are always feasible
        and meaningful for the random input variable regardless of its
        distribution type.

         If PLOW is left blank, then a minimum value of the distribution is
        used for plotting, provided it exists (for example, uniform
        distribution). If the distribution type has no minimum value (for
        example, a Gaussian distribution) then the default value is used to

        The PSTRES command specifies whether or not prestress effects are to be

        Prestress effects are calculated in a static or transient analysis for
        inclusion in a buckling, modal, harmonic (Method = FULL), or
        substructure generation analysis. If used in the solution processor
        (/SOLU), this command is valid only within the first load step.

        If you apply thermal body forces during a static analysis to calculate
        prestress effects, do not delete the forces during any subsequent full
        harmonic analyses. If you delete the thermal body forces, the thermal
        prestress effects will not be included in the harmonic analysis.
        Temperature loads used to define the thermal prestress will also be
        used in the full harmonic analysis as sinusoidally time-varying
        temperature loads.

        A prestress effect applied with non-follower loads resists rigid body
        rotation of the model. For example, an unsupported beam with axial
        tensile forces applied to both ends will have two nonzero rotational
        rigid body modes.

            enclosed in single quotes), parameters (numeric or character) or
            parametric expressions.  See below for additional details.

        Notes
        -----
        Causes execution of a macro file called Name, or, if not found, a macro
        block "Name" on the macro library file [*ULIB].  Argument values
        (numeric or character) are passed into the file or block and
        substituted for local parameters ARG1, ARG2, ..., AR18.  The file Name
        may also be executed as an "unknown command" (i.e., without the *USE
        command name) as described below.

        A macro is a sequence of ANSYS commands (as many as needed) recorded in
        a file or in a macro block in a library file (specified with the *ULIB
        command).  The file or block is typically executed with the *USE
        command.  In addition to command, numerical and alphanumeric data, the
        macro may include parameters which will be assigned numerical or
        alphanumerical character values when the macro is used.  Use of the
        macro may be repeated (within a do-loop, for example) with the
        parameters incremented.  A macro is defined within a run by "enclosing"
        a sequence of data input commands between a *CREATE and a *END
        command.  The data input commands are passive (not executed) while
        being written to the macro file.  The macro file (without *CREATE and
        *END ) can also be created external to ANSYS.

        Up to 99 specially named scalar parameters called ARG1 to AR99 are
        locally available to each macro.  Note that the prefix for the first 9
        parameters is "ARG," while the prefix for the last 90 is "AR."  A local
        parameter is one which is not affected by, nor does it affect, other
        parameters, even those of the same name, which are used outside of the
        macro.  The only way a local parameter can affect, or be affected by,
        parameters outside the macro is if values are passed out of, or into,
        the macro by an argument list.  Parameters ARG1 through AR18 can have
        their values (numeric or character) passed via the argument list on the
        *USE command (ARG1 through AR19 can be passed as arguments on the
        "unknown command" macro).  Parameters AR19 through AR99 (AR20 through
        AR99 in the "unknown command" macro) are available solely for use
        within the macro; they cannot be passed via an argument list.  Local
        parameters are available to do-loops and to /INPUT files processed
        within the macro.  In addition to an ARG1--AR99 set for each macro,
        another ARG1--AR99 set is available external to all macros, local to
        "non-macro" space.

        A macro is exited after its last line is executed.  Macros may be
        nested (such as a *USE or an "unknown command" within a macro).  Each
        nested macro has its own set of 99 local parameters.  Only one set of
        local parameters can be active at a time and that is the set
        corresponding to the macro currently being executed or to the set
        external to all macros (if any).  When a nested macro completes
        execution, the previous set of local parameters once again becomes
        available.  Use *STATUS,ARGX to view current macro parameter values.

        An alternate way of executing a macro file is via the "unknown command"
        route.  If a command unknown to the ANSYS program is entered, a search
        for a file of that name (plus a .MAC suffix) is made.  If the file
        exists, it is executed, if not, the "unknown command" message is
        output.  Thus, users can write their own commands in terms of other
        ANSYS commands.  The procedure is similar to issuing the *USE command
        with the unknown command in the Name field.  For example, the command
        CMD,10,20,30 is internally similar to *USE,CMD,10,20,30.  The macro
        file named CMD.MAC will be executed with the three parameters.  The
        *USE macro description also applies to the "unknown command" macro,
        except that various directories are searched and a suffix (.MAC) is
        assumed.  Also, a macro library file is not searched.

        A three-level directory search for the "unknown command" macro file may
        be available (see the Operations Guide).  The search order may be: 1) a
        high-level system directory, 2) the login directory, and 3) the local
        (working) directory.  Use the /PSEARCH command to change the directory
        search path.  For an "unknown command" CMD, the first file named
        CMD.MAC found to exist in the search order will be executed.  The
        command may be input as upper or lower case, however, it is converted
        to upper case before the file name search occurs.  On systems that
        uniquely support both upper and lower case file names, the file with
        the matching lower case name will be used if it exists, otherwise, the
        file with the matching upper case name will be used. All macro files
        placed in the apdl directory must be upper case.

         Note, since undocumented commands exist in the ANSYS program, the user
        should issue the command intended for the macro file name to be sure
        the "unknown command" message is output in the processor where it's to
        be used.  If the macro is to be used in other processors, the other
        processors must also be checked.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Controls time-step cutback during a nonlinear solution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Specifies the criteria for causing a cutback.  Valid labels are:

            PLSLIMIT  - Maximum equivalent plastic strain allowed within a time-step (substep).  If the
                        calculated value exceeds the VALUE, the program
                        performs a cutback (bisection).  VALUE defaults to 0.15
                        (15%).

            CRPLIMIT  - Set values for calculating the maximum equivalent creep ratio allowed within a
                        time step. If the calculated maximum creep ratio
                        exceeds the defined creep ratio limit, the program
                        performs a cutback.

            DSPLIMIT  - Maximum incremental displacement within the solution field in a time step
                        (substep).  If the maximum calculated value exceeds
                        VALUE, the program performs a cutback (bisection).
                        VALUE defaults to 1.0 x 107.

            NPOINT  - Number of points in a cycle for a second order dynamic equation, used to
                      control automatic time stepping.  If the number of
                      solution points per cycle is less than VALUE, the program
                      performs a cutback in time step size. VALUE defaults to
                      13 for linear analysis, 5 for nonlinear analysis. A
                      larger number of points yields a more accurate solution
                      but also increases the solution run time.

            This option works well for linear problems. For nonlinear analyses, other factors such as contact status changes and solution convergence rate can overwrite NPOINT. See Automatic Time Stepping in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for more information on automatic time stepping. - NOITERPREDICT 

            If VALUE is 0 (default), an internal auto time step scheme will predict the number of iterations for nonlinear convergence and perform a cutback earlier than the number of iterations specified by the NEQIT command. This is the recommended option. If VALUE is 1, the solution will iterate (if nonconvergent) to NEQIT number of iterations before a cutback is invoked. It is sometimes useful for poorly-convergent problems, but rarely needed in general. - Bisection is also controlled by contact status change, plasticity or creep
                              strain limit, and other factors. If any of these
                              factors occur, bisection will still take place,
                              regardless of the NOITERPREDICT setting.

            CUTBACKFACTOR  - Changes the cutback value for bisection. Default is 0.5. VALUE must be greater
                             than 0.0 and less than 1.0. This option is active
                             only if AUTOTS,ON is set.

        value
            Numeric value for the specified cutback criterion. For Lab =
            CRPLIMIT, VALUE is the creep criteria for the creep ratio limit.

        option
            Type of creep analysis. Valid for Lab = CRPLIMIT only.

            IMPRATIO  - Set the maximum creep ratio value for implicit creep. The default is 0.0 (i.e.,
                        no creep limit control) and any positive value is
                        valid. (See Implicit Creep Procedure in the Structural
                        Analysis Guide for information on how to define
                        implicit creep.)

            EXPRATIO   - Set the maximum creep ratio value for explicit creep. The default value is 0.1
                         and any positive value up to 0.25 is allowed. (See
                         Explicit Creep Procedure in the Structural Analysis
                         Guide for information on how to define explicit
                         creep.)

            STSLIMIT   - Stress threshold for calculating the creep ratio. For integration points with
                         effective stress below this threshold, the creep ratio
                         does not cause cutback. The default value is 0.0 and
                         any positive value is valid.

            STNLIMIT   - Elastic strain threshold for calculating the creep ratio. For integration
                         points with effective elastic strain below this
                         threshold, the creep ratio does not cause cutback. The
                         default value is 0.0 and any positive value is valid.

        Notes
        -----
        A cutback is a method for automatically reducing the step size when
        either the solution error is too large or the solution encounters
        convergence difficulties during a nonlinear analysis.

        Should a convergence failure occur, the program reduces the time step
        interval to a fraction of its previous size and automatically continues
        the solution from the last successfully converged time step. If the
        reduced time step again fails to converge, the program again reduces
        the time step size and proceeds with the solution. This process
        continues until convergence is achieved or the minimum specified time
        step value is reached.

        For creep analysis, the cutback procedure is similar; the process
        continues until the minimum specified time step size is reached.
        However, if the creep ratio limit is exceeded, the program issues a
        warning but continues the substep until the analysis is complete. In
        this case, convergence is achieved but the creep ratio criteria is not
        satisfied.

            READ - Reads in a generic (.cdb format) new mesh file generated by a third-party
                   application. This remeshing option applies to both 2-D and
                   3-D rezoning.

            SPLIT - Splits selected elements of an existing 2-D or 3-D mesh such that a
                    quadrilateral element is split into four quadrilaterals, a
                    degenerate quadrilateral is split into three
                    quadrilaterals, and a quadratic triangular element is split
                    into four quadratic triangles.  A tetrahedral element is
                    split into eight tetrahedra.

        filename
            Name of a .cdb generic mesh file. The default value is jobname.
            Valid only when Action = READ.

        ext
            File name extension. The only valid (and the default) extension is
            CDB. Valid only when Action = READ.

        --
            Unused field.

        opt1
            Specifies options for the new mesh when using a generic imported
            mesh file or the mesh-splitting remeshing method. Valid only when
            Action = READ or Action = SPLIT.

            REGE  - Regenerates all node and element numbers on the new mesh using an offset of the
                    highest existing node and element numbers. This is the
                    default behavior when Action = READ; otherwise, this value
                    is ignored.

            KEEP  - Keeps the similarly numbered nodes and elements in the new and the old meshes
                    unchanged. Valid only when Action = READ.

            TRAN  - Generates transition elements to ensure nodal compatibility between split and
                    unsplit parts of the mesh. Valid only when Action = SPLIT
                    for 2-D analyses.

        opt2

            These options are valid only when Action = SPLIT for 2-D analyses.

            QUAD  - Minimizes the number of degenerate elements in the transition mesh and tries to
                    maximize the number of quadrilateral transition elements
                    across several layers of elements from the split regions.
                    This is the default behavior.

                    mostly degenerate elements with a single element layer.

        Notes
        -----
        The REMESH command is valid only during the rezoning (REZONE) process.

        In rezoning, a REMESH,START command temporarily exits the /SOLU
        solution processor and enters a special mode of the /PREP7
        preprocessor, after which a limited number of preprocessing commands
        are available for mesh control, but no solution commands are valid.

        A REMESH,FINISH command exits the remeshing process and reenters the
        solution processor, at which point no preprocessing commands are
        available. If the new mesh exists, the command creates contact elements
        if needed, and transfers all boundary conditions (BCs) and loads from
        the original mesh to the new mesh. You can issue any list or plot
        command to verify the created contact elements, transferred BCs, and
        loads. A REMESH,FINISH command is valid only after a previously issued
        REMESH,START command, and is the only way to safely end the remeshing
        operation (and exit the special mode of the /PREP7 preprocessor).

        A REMESH,READ command is valid only when you want to perform a rezoning
        operation using a generic new mesh generated by a third-party
        application (rather than a new mesh generated internally by the ANSYS
        program). The command is valid between REMESH,START and REMESH,FINISH
        commands. In this case, the only valid file extension is .cdb (Ext =
        CDB). When Option = KEEP, ANSYS assumes that the common node and
        element numbers between the old and the new mesh are topologically
        similar (that is, these commonly numbered areas have the same element
        connectivity and nodal coordinates).

        A REMESH,SPLIT command is valid only when you wish to perform a
        rezoning operation by splitting the existing mesh. The command is valid
        between REMESH,START and REMESH,FINISH commands.

        You can use REMESH,READ and REMESH,SPLIT commands for horizontal
        multiple rezoning provided that the meshes used in REMESH,READ do not
        intersect. (ANSYS recommends against issuing an AREMESH command after
        issuing either of these commands.)

        rezoning operation, see Rezoning in the Advanced Analysis Guide.

                retained for subsequent load steps. (This behavior is the
                default.)

            1 - Repeat gauging for each load step. Rewrites the gauging information at each
                load step to accommodate changing boundary conditions on the AZ
                degree of freedom (for example, adding or deleting AZ
                constraints via the D or CE commands).

        Notes
        -----
        The GAUGE command controls the tree-gauging procedure required for
        electromagnetic analyses using an edge-based magnetic formulation
        (elements SOLID236 and SOLID237).

        Gauging occurs at the solver level for each solution (SOLVE). It sets
        additional zero constraints on the edge-flux degrees of freedom AZ to
        produce a unique solution; the additional constraints are removed after
        solution.

        Use the FREQ option to specify how the command generates gauging
        information for multiple load steps.

        Access the gauging information via the _TGAUGE component of gauged
        nodes. The program creates and uses this component internally to remove
        and reapply the AZ constraints required by gauging. If FREQ = 0, the
        _TGAUGE component is created at the first load step and is used to
        reapply the tree gauge constraints at subsequent load steps. If FREQ =
        1, the tree-gauging information and the _TGAUGE component are generated
        at every load step

        If gauging is turned off (GAUGE,OFF), you must specify your own gauging

            restart files is TIME / NUM, where TIME is the analysis end-time
            specified on the TIME command.

        dt
            Time interval at which the d3dump (restart) files are written. If
            NUM is input, DT is ignored.

        Notes
        -----
        You can use NUM or DT to specify the time interval at which d3dump
        restart files will be written. You should not specify both quantities;
        if both are input, NUM will be used. The restart files are written
        sequentially as d3dump01, d3dump02, etc.

        In LS-DYNA, the restart file output is specified in terms of number of
        time steps. Because the total number of time steps is not known until
        the LS-DYNA solution finishes, Mechanical APDL calculates an
        approximate number of time steps for the solution, and then uses NUM or
        DT to calculate the required LS-DYNA input. This approximated number of
        time steps may be different from the total number reached in LS-DYNA
        after the solution finishes. Therefore, the number of restart dump
        files or the output interval may differ slightly from what you
        requested using NUM or DT.

        In an explicit dynamic small restart (EDSTART,2) or full restart
        analysis (EDSTART,3), the EDDUMP setting will default to the NUM or DT
        value used in the original analysis. You can issue EDDUMP in the
        restart to change this setting.

        the FSIN label using SF, SFA, SFE, or SFL or the FVIN label using BFE).

        The number of buckets used to partition a flagged interface is equal to
        the scaling factor (%) times the total number of interface elements.

        Parameters

        surfname
            Eight character surface name.

        surftype
            Surface type.

            CPLANE - Surface is defined by the cutting plane in window one (controlled by the
                     working plane (/CPLANE,1), NOT the view settings
                     (/CPLANE,0)).

            SPHERE - Surface is defined by a spherical surface centered about the working plane
                     origin.

            INFC - Surface is defined by a cylindrical surface centered about the working plane
                   origin and extending indefinitely in the positive and
                   negative Z directions.

        nrefine
            Refinement level.

            For SurfType = CPLANE -  The refinement level of the surface "mesh". This will be an integer between 0
                              and 3 (default = 0). See Notes below.

            For SurfType = SPHERE - The number of divisions along a 90° arc (minimum = 9). The default is 9.

            For SurfType = INFC - The number of divisions along a 90° arc (minimum = 9). The default is 9.

        radius
            Appropriate radius value (for INFC or SPHERE).

        tolout
            Tolerance value for inclusion of element facets within a prescribed
            volume. (for INFC)

        Notes
        -----
        This command creates a new surface and stores the following data for
        that surface:

        For SurfType = CPLANE, nRefine refers to the number of points that
        define the surface. An nRefine value of zero is used for points where
        the element face intersects the cutting plane.

        If SurfType = CPLANE and nRefine = 0, the points reside at the section
        cuts where the element intersects the cutting plane. Increasing nRefine
        from 0 to 1 will subdivide each surface facet into 4 subfacets, and
        increase the number of points at which results can be interpolated.

        For SurfType = CPLANE , the setting from the /EFACET command will
        affect the creation of surface facets and the quality of the fit of the
        surface in the model.  SUCR employs geometry data from PowerGraphics to
        aid in determining where the surface intersects the model.  If
        /EFACET,1 is in effect when the SUCR command is issued, then the
        curvature of high order elements (that is, elements with midside nodes)
        will be ignored.  If your model contains high order elements, you can
        see a better fit for your surface if /EFACET,2 is in effect when the
        SUCR command is issued.  Currently, the SUCR command interprets
        /EFACET,4 to mean /EFACET,2.

        For SurfType = INFC, a default tolerance of 0.01 will be applied to
        include the vertices of any facets that fall out of the cylinder
        definition. This tolerance increases the facet size by one percent to
        check for inclusion. Excluding facets under such a small tolerance may
        yield unacceptable (aesthetically) results. Increasing the tolerance by
        a larger amount (0.1 or 10%) will sometimes yield smother edges along
        the surface you create.

            Add or remove key:

            ADD - Add midside node to elements (default).

            REMOVE - Remove midside nodes from elements.

        edges
            ALL

            ALL - Add (or remove) midside nodes to (from) all edges of all selected elements,
                  independent of which nodes are selected (default).

            EITHER - Add (or remove) midside nodes only to (from) element edges which have either
                     corner node selected.

            BOTH - Add (or remove) midside nodes only to (from) element edges which have both
                   corner nodes selected.

        Notes
        -----
        This command adds midside nodes to (or removes midside nodes from) the
        selected elements. For this to occur, the selected elements must be
        midside node capable, the active element type [TYPE] must allow midside
        node capability, and the relationship between the finite element model
        and the solid model (if any) must first be disassociated [MODMSH].

        By default, EMID generates a midside node wherever a zero (or missing)
        midside node occurs for that element. You can control this and add (or
        remove) midside nodes selectively by using the Edges argument. Nodes
        are located midway between the two appropriate corner nodes based on a
        linear Cartesian interpolation. Nodal coordinate system rotation angles
        are also linearly interpolated. Connected elements share the same
        midside node. Node numbers are generated sequentially from the maximum
        node number.

        The EMID command is useful for transforming linear element types to
        quadratic element types having the same corner node connectivity.

        EMID is also useful for transforming elements created outside of the
        program.

        v1
            Value (in the element coordinate system) assigned to the database
            item (and component, if any).  If zero, a zero value will be

        Notes
        -----
        The DESOL command defines or modifies solution results in the database
        at a node of an area or volume element.  For example,
        DESOL,35,50,S,X,1000,2000,1000 assigns values 1000, 2000, and 1000 to
        SX, SY, and SZ (respectively) of node 50 of element 35.

        The settings of the POST1 FORCE, SHELL, and LAYER commands, if
        applicable, further specify which database items are affected.

        For layered composite shells, specify the current element layer (LAYER)
        before issuing the DESOL command.

        All data is stored in the solution coordinate system but is displayed
        in the results coordinate system (RSYS). To list the current results,

        line
            Line at which constraints are to be specified. If ALL, apply to all
            selected lines [LSEL]. If LINE = P, graphical picking is enabled
            and all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the
            GUI). A component name may also be substituted for LINE.

        area
            Area containing line. The normal to the symmetry or antisymmetry
            surface is assumed to lie on this area. Defaults to the lowest
            numbered selected area containing the line number.

        lab
            Symmetry label (see 2):

            SYMM - Generate symmetry constraints.

            ASYM - Generate antisymmetry constraints.

        value1
            Value of DOF (real part) or table name reference on the line.
            Valid for all DOF labels.  To specify a table, enclose the table
            name in % signs (e.g., DL,LINE,AREA,TEMP,%tabname%).  Use the *DIM
            command to define a table.

        Notes
        -----
        You can transfer constraints from lines  to nodes with the  DTRAN or
        SBCTRAN commands.  See the DK command for information about generating
        other constraints at lines.

        Symmetry and antisymmetry constraints are generated as described on the
        DSYM command.

        Setting Lab = VOLT and Value1 = 0 applies the J-normal boundary
        condition (current density vector (J) flows normal to the line).  No
        input is required for the J-parallel condition because it is the
        natural boundary condition.

        Tabular boundary conditions (Value1 = %tabname%) are available only for
        the following degree of freedom labels: Electric (VOLT), Structural
        (UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ), Acoustic (PRES, UX, UY, UZ), and
        temperature (TEMP, TBOT, TE2, TE3, . . ., TTOP).

        Constraints specified by the DL command can conflict with other

            Predefined vector item (from Table 223: PLVECT - Valid Item Labels
            below) or a label identifying the i-component of a user-defined
            vector.

        lab2
            Label identifying the j-component of a user-defined vector. In most
            cases, this value must be blank if Item is selected from
            Table 223: PLVECT - Valid Item Labels. Individual principal
            stresses (Item = S) or principal strains (Item = EPxx) may be
            plotted by specifying the value as 1, 2, or 3.

        lab3
            Label identifying the k-component of a user-defined vector.  Must
            be blank if Item is selected from list below or for 2-D user
            defined vector.

        labp
            Label assigned to resultant vector for display labeling (defaults
            to Item).

        mode
            Vector or raster mode override key:

            (blank) - Use the setting of KEY on the /DEVICE command.

            RAST - Use raster mode for PLVECT displays.

            VECT - Use vector mode for PLVECT displays.

        loc
            Vector location for display of field element results:

            ELEM - Display at element centroid (default).

            NODE - Display at element nodes.

        edge
            Edge display override key:

            (blank) - Use the setting of Key on the /EDGE  command.

            OFF - Deactivate the edge display.

            ON - Activate the edge display.

        kund
            Undisplaced shape key:

            0 - Display vectors on undeformed mesh or geometry.

            1 - Display vectors on deformed mesh or geometry.

        Notes
        -----
        Displays various solution results as vectors (arrows) for the selected
        nodes and/or elements (elements must contain at least three nodes that
        are not colinear).  For example, PLVECT,U displays the displacement
        vector for all selected nodes.  For section displays [/TYPE], the
        vectors are shown only on the section face (i.e., cutting plane).  The
        PLVECT display of principal strains and stresses  (Item = S, EPTO,
        EPEL, EPPL, EPCR, or EPTH) on a "cut" of the model (/TYPE,,1 ,5,7,8, or
        9) is not supported.  The resulting plot displays the vectors on all
        selected elements, not on just the sliced surface.  See the /VSCALE
        command to scale vector lengths. Vector magnitudes may be shown as a
        contour display with the PLNSOL command.  Various results also depend
        upon the recalculation method and the selected results location [LAYER,
        SHELL, and NSEL].

        Items may be selected from a set of recognized vector labels (Item) or
        a vector may be defined from up to three scalar labels
        (Item,Lab2,Lab3).  Scalar labels may be user-defined with the ETABLE
        command.  The vectors appear on an element display as arrows showing
        the relative magnitude of the vector and its direction.  The predefined
        items will be shown either at the node or at the element centroid,
        depending on what item is being displayed and depending on the Loc
        setting.  User defined ETABLE items will be shown at the element
        centroid, regardless of the Loc setting. Stress vectors appear as
        arrows at the element centroid, with the arrowheads pointing away from
        each other for tension and toward each other for compression.

        For PowerGraphics, vector arrow displays are generated in Global
        Cartesian (RSYS = 0). All subsequent displays will revert to your
        original coordinate system.

        When vector mode is active (Mode = VECT), use the Z-buffered display
        type [/TYPE,,6] to maximize speed of PLVECT plots  (other hidden
        display types may make plotting slow). For PowerGraphics
        [/GRAPHICS,POWER], the items marked with [1] are not supported  by
        PowerGraphics.

        It is possible to plot principal stresses (Item = S) or principal
        strains (Item = EPxx) individually. To do so, specify a Lab2 value of
        1, 2, or 3. For example, the following are valid commands:

            [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            0 - Nodes and point elements associated with the original keypoints will be
                generated (scaled) if they exist.

            1 - Nodes and point elements will not be generated.

        imove
            Specifies whether keypoints will be moved or newly defined:

            0 - Additional keypoints will be generated.

            1 - Original keypoints will be moved to new position (KINC and NOELEM are ignored).
                Use only if the old keypoints are no longer needed at their
                original positions.  Corresponding meshed items are also moved
                if not needed at their original position.

        Notes

        Generates a scaled set of keypoints (and corresponding mesh) from a
        pattern of keypoints.  The MAT, TYPE, REAL, and ESYS attributes are
        based on the keypoints in the pattern and not the current settings.
        Scaling is done in the active coordinate system.  Keypoints in the
        pattern could have been generated in any coordinate system.  However,
        solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is not recommended.

        icsys
            The coordinate system number used in the modal cyclic symmetry
            solution. The default is the global cylindrical coordinate system
            (specified via the CSYS command where KCN = 1).

        sctang
            The sector angle in degrees, equal to 360 divided by the number of
            cyclic sectors.

        --
            This field is reserved for future use.

        phase
            The phase angle in degrees to use for the expansion. The default is
            0. Typically, the value is the peak displacement (or stress/strain)
            phase angle obtained via the CYCPHASE command.

        Notes
        -----
        Issue this command to display the results of a modal cyclic symmetry
        analysis.

        When you issue the EXPAND,Nrepeat command, subsequent SET commands read
        data from the results file and expand them to Nrepeat sectors. As long
        as no entities have been modified, this expansion can be negated (that
        is, reverted to single sector) by issuing EXPAND with no arguments. If
        you modify entities and wish to return to the partial model, use the
        Session Editor (see Restoring Database Contents in the Operations
        Guide).

        EXPAND displays the results and allows you to print them, as if for a
        full model. The harmonic index (automatically retrieved from the
        results file) appears in the legend column.

        When plotting or printing element strain energy (SENE), the EXPAND
        command works with brick or tet models only. Element kinetic energy
        (KENE) plotting or printing is not supported.

        EXPAND is a specification command valid only in POST1.  It is
        significantly different from the /CYCEXPAND command in several
        respects, (although you can use either command to display the results
        of a modal cyclic symmetry analysis):

        EXPAND has none of the limitations of the /CYCEXPAND command.

        EXPAND changes the database by modifying the geometry, the nodal
        displacements, and element stresses as they are read from the results
        file, whereas the /CYCEXPAND command does not change the database.

        Caution:: : The EXPAND command creates new nodes and elements;
        therefore, saving (or issuing the /EXIT, ALL command) after issuing the
        EXPAND command can result in large databases.

        type
            BEAM

            BEAM - Defines a beam section.

            TAPER - Defines a tapered beam or pipe section. The sections at the end points must be
                    topologically identical.

            GENB - Defines a nonlinear general (temperature-dependent) beam section.

            PIPE - Defines a pipe section.

            LINK - Defines a link section.

            AXIS - Define the axis for a general axisymmetric section.

            SHELL - Defines a shell section.

            JOINT - Defines a joint section.

            REINF - Defines a reinforcing section.

            CONTACT - Defines a contact section.

        subtype
            When Type = BEAM, the possible beam sections that can be defined
            for Subtype are:

        name
            An eight-character name for the section. Name can be a string such
            as "W36X210" or "HP13X73" for beam sections. Section name can
            consist of letters and numbers, but cannot contain punctuation,
            special characters, or spaces.

        refinekey
            Sets mesh refinement level for thin-walled beam sections. Valid
            values are 0 (the default - no mesh refinement) through 5 (high
            level of mesh refinement). This value has meaning only when Type =
            BEAM.

        Notes
        -----
        SECTYPE sets the section ID number, section type, and subtype for a
        section. If the section ID number is not specified, ANSYS increments
        the highest section ID number currently defined in the database by one.
        A previously-defined section with the same identification number will
        be redefined. The geometry data describing this section type is defined
        by a subsequent SECDATA command. Define the offsets by a subsequent
        SECOFFSET command. The SLIST command lists the section properties, and
        the SECPLOT command displays the section to scale. The SECNUM command
        assigns the section ID number to a subsequently-defined beam element.

        For a beam section (Type = BEAM), a subsequent SECDATA command builds a
        numeric model using a nine-node cell for determining the properties
        (Ixx, Iyy, etc.) of the section and for the solution to the Poisson's
        equation for torsional behavior. See Beam Analysis and Cross Sections
        in the Structural Analysis Guide for examples using the section
        commands.

        For a nonlinear general beam section (Type = GENB), the Subtype and
        REFINEKEY options do not apply. Subsequent commands are necessary to
        define the section: BSAX, BSM1, BSM2, BSTQ, BSS1, BSS2, BSMD, and BSTE
        are available. All other section commands are ignored for this section
        type.

        For a preintegrated composite-beam section (Type = COMB), the REFINEKEY
        options do not apply. Subsequent commands are necessary to define the
        section: CBTMP, CBMX, CBMD, and CBTE are available. All other section
        commands are ignored for this section type.

        For a tapered beam or pipe section (Type = TAPER), two subsequent
        SECDATA commands are required (one for each end section). Section ends
        must be topologically identical (same Subtype, number of cells and
        material IDs). For a tapered pipe section, end sections must have the
        same number of cells around the circumference and along the pipe wall,
        and the same shell section ID for a composite pipe wall.

        address
            Email address (up to 64 characters) of the intended recipient of

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        Notes
        -----
        Issue the /MAIL command to alert someone when a long-running job has
        completed, as shown in this example:

        If you are running ANSYS in a Microsoft Windows environment, you must
        configure BLAT (a freeware program provided with ANSYS). Before issuing
        the /MAIL command, enter this command from the C:\Program Files\Ansys
        Inc\V162\Ansys\Bin\Intel directory:

        If you are running ANSYS in a Windows x64 environment, enter this
        command from the C:\Program Files\Ansys Inc\V162\Ansys\Bin\Winx64
        directory:

        where:

        <email server name> is the name of the user’s email server; for
        example, smtphost.xyz.com

        <username>@<domain> is the email address of the user; for example,
        john.doe@xyz.com

        Because Windows cannot operate on a busy file, you cannot mail standard
        ANSYS output.  Instead, redirect the output to a file and then mail
        that file, as shown in this example:

        APDL Command: /REPLOT

        Automatically reissues the last display command for convenience.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label
            Controls the type of replot.

            RESIZE - Issued internally when a graphics window resize occurs (Default).

            FAST - Only applicable for 3-D devices that allow a fast redisplay for changes in the
                   view characteristics only.

        Notes
        -----
        Reissues the last display command (NPLOT, EPLOT, KPLOT, PLNSOL, PLVAR,
        etc.), along with its parameters, for convenience.  The current display
        specifications are used.

        When the last display command is invalid in a particular processor, the
        use of the /REPLOT command is also invalid in that processor.  However,
        if you attempt a /REPLOT and the last display command is invalid in the
        current processor, ANSYS produces an element display [EPLOT] instead,
        as long as the last display command was PLNSOL, PLESOL, or PLDISP.
        ANSYS performs this substitution of /REPLOT with EPLOT for your
        convenience.

        For example, the PLNSOL command, which is used to display solution
        results as continuous contours, is a valid command in the general
        postprocessor [/POST1].  If you issue PLNSOL followed by /REPLOT while
        in the general postprocessor, the /REPLOT command effectively reissues
        your earlier PLNSOL command, along with its parameters.  But if you
        then exit the general postprocessor, enter the preprocessor [/PREP7],
        and issue the /REPLOT command again, ANSYS internally issues EPLOT
        instead.  This occurs because PLNSOL is not a valid command in the
        preprocessor.

        When you click on one of the buttons on the  Pan, Zoom, Rotate dialog
        box to manipulate the view of a model, the /REPLOT command is issued
        internally.  Thus, the substitution of /REPLOT with EPLOT as described
        above may occur not only for the PLNSOL, PLESOL, and PLDISP results
        display commands, but also for operations that you perform with the
        Pan, Zoom, Rotate dialog box.

        /REPLOT will not show boundary conditions if they are only applied to a
        solid model and the last display command (for example, EPLOT) displays
        the finite element model. To show boundary conditions, the following
        options are available:

        Issue /REPLOT after you issue the SBCTRAN command to transfer solid
        model boundary conditions to the finite element model.

        Issue /REPLOT after you issue a solid model display command (for
        example, VPLOT).

        This command is valid in any processor (except as noted above).

        location), starting at location 4.

        Notes
        -----
        The CORIOLIS command is used for analyses in either a rotating or a
        stationary reference frame, and performs differently according to the
        designated RefFrame value. Specific restrictions and elements apply to
        each case, as follows:

        ROTATING REFERENCE FRAME (RefFrame = OFF):

        The command applies the Coriolis effect in the following structural
        element types: MASS21, SHELL181, PLANE182, PLANE183, SOLID185,
        SOLID186, SOLID187, BEAM188, BEAM189, SOLSH190, SHELL281, PIPE288 and
        PIPE289. It also applies this effect in the PLANE223, SOLID226, and
        SOLID227 analyses with structural degrees of freedom.

        In a rotating reference frame, both the Coriolis and spin-softening
        effects contribute to the gyroscopic moment. Therefore, ANSYS applies
        spin-softening by default for dynamic analyses. If a rotational
        velocity is specified (OMEGA or CMOMEGA), centrifugal forces will be
        included.

        To include Coriolis effects in a large deflection prestressed analysis,
        follow the procedure for linear perturbation detailed in Considerations
        for Rotating Structures. In a nonlinear transient analysis
        (ANTYPE,TRANS and NLGEOM, ON), any spinning motion applied through
        either the IC of the D commands will include the Coriolis effect
        without having to issue the CORIOLIS command. Refer to Rotating
        Structure Analysis in the Advanced Analysis Guide for more information.

        STATIONARY REFERENCE FRAME (RefFrame = ON):

        The command activates the gyroscopic damping matrix in the following
        structural elements: MASS21, BEAM188, SHELL181, BEAM189, SOLID185,
        SOLID186, SOLID187, SOLID272, SOLID273, SHELL281, PIPE288, PIPE289, and
        MATRIX50.

        The rotating structure must be axisymmetric about the axis of rotation.

        Static analysis (ANTYPE, STATIC) does not support Coriolis effects with
        a stationary reference frame. However, you can include the gyroscopic
        effects in a prestresses analysis follow the procedure detailed in
        Considerations for Rotating Structures.

        Rotating damping effect (RotDamp = ON) applies only for the stationary
        reference frame. Therefore, this effect is supported only by the
        elements listed above that generate a gyroscopic damping matrix.
        Proportional damping must be present in the element (MP,BETD or BETAD).
        It is also supported by element COMBI214 with non zero and axisymmetric
        damping characteristics (non zero real constants C11=C22 and
        C21=C12=0).

        For more information about using the CORIOLIS command, see Rotating
        Structure Analysis in the Advanced Analysis Guide and also in the
        Rotordynamic Analysis Guide. For details about the Coriolis and
        gyroscopic effect element formulations, see the Mechanical APDL Theory
        Reference.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

            0 - All data in the database, including the scalar parameters, are replaced with

            1 - All data in the database, except the scalar parameters, are replaced with the

        knoplot
            If equal to 1, will suppress automatic plot. Otherwise, if the GUI
            is on and this RESUME command was not read from a file, the
            selected elements from Fname are plotted. (If there are no selected
            elements, selected nodes are plotted. If no nodes, volumes; if no
            volumes, areas; if no areas, lines; if no lines, keypoints. If
            there are no selected keypoints, the screen is erased.)

        Notes
        -----
        The RESUME command resumes a database file into the ANSYS program. The
        command causes the database file (File.DB) to be read, thereby
        resetting the database (including any geometry settings) either a) as
        it was at the last SAVE command, or b) as it was saved with the last
        /EXIT command, whichever was last.

        For multiple load step analyses (because only the data for one load
        step at a time may reside in the database), the load step data restored
        to the database will correspond to the load step data written when the
        save occurred.

        If the database file was saved in another ANSYS, Inc. product, it may
        contain element type and KEYOPT specifications which are invalid in the
        resuming product. Immediately after the database resume is completed,
        you should redefine these invalid element types and KEYOPT settings to
        valid ones (ET, KEYOPT).

        The NOPAR = 1 option should not be used if array parameters are
        defined, as existing array parameters might be redefined with arbitrary
        values. For a more general method of preventing the replacement of both
        scalar and array parameters, see PARSAV and PARRES.)

        Notes
        -----
        Prints the nodal solution results for the selected nodes in the sorted
        sequence. For example, PRNSOL,U,X prints the X component of
        displacement vector U (that is, the UX degree of freedom). Component
        results are in the global Cartesian coordinate directions unless
        transformed (RSYS). Various element results also depend upon the
        recalculation method and the selected results location (AVPRIN, RSYS,
        LAYER, SHELL, and NSEL). If the LAYER command is issued, then the
        resulting output is listed in full graphics mode (/GRAPHICS,FULL). You
        can use the FORCE command to define which component of the nodal load
        (static, damping, inertia, or total) should be used.

        PowerGraphics can affect your nodal solution listings. For
        PowerGraphics (/GRAPHICS,POWER), results are listed only for the model
        exterior surfaces.

        When shell element types are present, results are output on a surface-
        by-surface basis. For shell elements, such as SHELL181 or SHELL281, and
        for ELBOW290, printed output is for both the top and bottom surfaces.
        For solid elements such as SOLID185, the output is averaged for each
        surface and printed as follows:

        For a node at a vertex, three lines are output (one printed line for
        each surface).

        For a node on an edge, two lines are output (one printed line for each
        surface).

        For nodes on a face, one value is output.

        For nodes interior to the volume, no printed values are output.

        If a node is common to more than one element, or if a geometric
        discontinuity exists, several conflicting listings may result. For
        example, a corner node incorporating results from solid elements and
        shell elements could yield as many as nine different results; the
        printed output would be averages at the top and bottom for the three
        shell surfaces plus averages at the three surfaces for the solid, for a
        total of nine lines of output. ANSYS does not average result listings
        across geometric discontinuities when shell element types are present.
        It is important to analyze the listings at discontinuities to ascertain
        the significance of each set of data.

        The printed output for full graphics (/GRAPHICS,FULL) follows the
        standard ANSYS convention of averaging results at the node.  For shell
        elements, the default for display is TOP so that the results for the
        top of the shell are averaged with the other elements attached to that
        node.

        If an NSORT, ESORT or /ESHAPE command is issued with PowerGraphics
        activated, then the PRNSOL listings will be the same as in full
        graphics mode (/GRAPHICS,FULL). The items marked with [2] are not
        supported by PowerGraphics. To print midside nodes, you must first
        issue an /EFACET,2 command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Label identifying the option to be performed:

            ADD - Add a rotated nodal coordinate constraint (default).

            DELE - Delete specified rotated nodal coordinate constraints.

            LIST - List all rotated nodal coordinate constraints.

        cid
            Coordinate system ID for which rotated nodal constraints will be
            added or deleted. The CID must have been previously defined with
            the EDLCS command. If Option = DELE, use CID = ALL to delete all
            previously specified nodal constraints.

        cname
            Nodal component set to which the rotated coordinate constraint will
            be applied. Cname must be previously specified using the CM
            command.

        dof1, dof2, dof3, . . . , dof6
            Degrees of freedom for which the rotated nodal constraint will be
            applied.  Valid degree of freedom labels include UX, UY, UZ, ROTX,
            ROTY, and ROTZ.  If DOF1 = ALL, rotated nodal constraints will be
            applied to all degrees of freedom.

        APDL Command: MFLCOMM

        Defines a load transfer for code coupling analyses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
             Set to SURF for a surface load transfer. Only surface load
            transfers are available for MFX.

        fname1
            Sets the field solver name for the server (sending) code with a
            case-sensitive character string of up to 80 characters.

        intname1
            Sets the interface name or number for the field solver of the
            server code. ANSYS interfaces are numbered and are defined by the
            SF family of commands (SF, SFA, or SFE) with the FSIN surface load
            label. CFX interfaces use names, which are set in CFX-Pre.

        label1
            Sets the surface load label for the field solver of the server code
            with a character string of up to 80 characters. ANSYS uses a
            combination of the label and option to determine what data is
            transferred (e.g., heat flows and not fluxes are sent with the
            label/option pair HFLU/CPP). ANSYS cannot serve total force or
            total force density to CFX for either formulation. CFX will send
            the data requested by the label regardless of the option. CFX
            labels that have more than one word must be enclosed in single
            quotes. Note that this field is case-sensitive; i.e., FORC will
            work, but forc will not.

        fname2
            Sets the field solver name for the client (receiving) code with a
            character string of up to 80 characters.

        intname2
            Sets the interface name or number for the field solver of the
            client code with a character string of up to 80 characters. ANSYS
            interfaces are numbered and are defined by the SF family of
            commands (SF, SFA, or SFE) with the FSIN surface load label. CFX
            interfaces use names, which are set in CFX-Pre.

        label2
            Sets the surface load label for the field solver of the client code
            with a character string of up to 80 characters. ANSYS uses a
            combination of the label and option to determine what data is

            label-option pair HFLU/CPP). CFX will send the data requested by

            one word must be enclosed in single quotes. Note that this field is
            case-sensitive; i.e., FORC will work, but forc will not.

        option
            NONC

            NONC - Profile preserving: Sets the interface load transfer to the nonconservative
                   formulation (default for displacement and temperature). In
                   the nonconservative formulation, the force density (or heat
                   flux) is transferred across the interface, preserving the
                   density profile between the two fields.

            CPP - Conservative: Uses a local conservative formulation while preserving the
                  density profile (default for total force and wall heat flow).
                  In the conservative formulation, total force (or heat flow)
                  must be transferred across the interface from the CFX field
                  solver to the ANSYS field solver.

        Notes
        -----
        ANSYS input should always be in consistent units for its model.

        ANSYS uses a combination of the label and option to determine what data
        to transfer. CFX will send exactly the data requested by the label,
        regardless of the option. However, for the NONC option, the CFX label
        must be Total Force Density or Wall Heat Flux and for the CPP option,
        the CFX label must be Total Force or Wall Heat Flow.

        For more information on profile preserving and conservative load
        transfer, see Load Interpolation in the Coupled-Field Analysis Guide.
        Mapping Diagnostics are also available; however, if the improperly-
        mapped nodes are based on the CFX mesh, you should ignore the ANSYS-
        generated components because the CFX nodes are not present in the ANSYS
        database.

        If you are working interactively, you can choose two pre-defined
        combinations, Mechanical or Thermal, or you can choose a Custom option.
        If you choose the Mechanical load type, then the Total Force Density
        and Total Mesh Displacement data (corresponding to the ANSYS FORC and
        DISP labels, respectively) is transferred. If you choose the Thermal
        load type, then the Temperature and Wall Heat Flux data (corresponding
        to the ANSYS TEMP and HFLU labels, respectively) is transferred. If you
        choose Custom, you can select any valid combination of label and option
        as described above.

        The ANSYS Multi-field solver solver does not allow you to switch the
        load transfer direction for the same load quantity across the same
        interfaces for a restart run. For example, if Field1 sends temperature
        to and receives heat flow from Field2 across Interface 1 in a previous
        solution, then you cannot make Field1 send heat flow to and receive
        temperatures from Field2 across the same interface in a restart run,
        even if you cleared the corresponding load transfer command.

        See Multi-field Commands in the Coupled-Field Analysis Guide for a list
        of all ANSYS Multi-field solver commands and their availability for MFS
        and MFX analyses.

        Notes
        -----
        MADAPT invokes a predefined ANSYS macro for adaptive meshing and
        solution of edge-based magnetic analyses.  The macro causes repeated
        runs of the PREP7, SOLUTION, and POST1 phases of the ANSYS program with
        mesh density refinements based upon the percentage error in energy
        norm.

        The MADAPT command macro requires a second, user-defined macro, which
        must be named madaptld.mac and must reside in the same directory where
        ANSYS is being run. This madaptld macro must contain loads and boundary
        conditions, based on permanent geometry or solid model features (such
        as sides or vertices). Loads specified in the madaptld macro cannot be
        based on node numbers because the node numbers will change throughout
        the refinement process. This secondary macro is required because the
        MADAPT macro process must delete all loads and boundary conditions at
        every refinement step.

        MADAPT refines tetrahedral volume elements based on error. Hexahedra,
        wedges, and pyramids are not refined (see NREFINE).

        distkey
            Key that specifies whether the rename operation is performed on all

        Notes
        -----
        Renames a file.  Ex:  /RENAME,A,,,B renames file A to B in the same
        directory.  /RENAME,A,DAT,,,INP renames file A.DAT to A.INP. On all
        systems, this command will overwrite any existing file named B. See the
        Operations Guide for details. Only ANSYS binary files should be
        renamed. Use /SYS and system renaming commands for other files.

        In distributed parallel mode (Distributed ANSYS), only the master
        process will rename Fname1.Ext1 to Fname2.Ext2 by default. However,
        when DistKey is set to 1 (or ON or YES), the command is executed by all
        processes. In this case, Fname1 and Fname2 will automatically have the
        process rank appended to them. This means Fname1N.Ext1 will be renamed
        to Fname2N.Ext2 by all processes, where N is the Distributed ANSYS
        process rank. For more information see Differences in General Behavior

        APDL Command: LESIZE

        Specifies the divisions and spacing ratio on unmeshed lines.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nl1
            Number of the line to be modified.  If ALL, modify all selected
            lines [LSEL].  If NL1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A
            component name may also be substituted for NL1.

        size
            If NDIV is blank, SIZE is the division (element edge) length.  The
            number of divisions is automatically calculated from the line
            length (rounded upward to next integer).  If SIZE is zero (or
            blank), use ANGSIZ or NDIV.

        angsiz
            The division arc (in degrees) spanned by the element edge (except
            for straight lines, which always result in one division).  The
            number of divisions is automatically calculated from the line
            length (rounded upward to next integer).

        ndiv
            If positive, NDIV is the number of element divisions per line.  If
            -1 (and KFORC = 1), NDIV is assumed to be zero element divisions
            per line. TARGE169 with a rigid specification ignores NDIV and will
            always mesh with one element division.

        space
            Spacing ratio.  If positive, nominal ratio of last division size to
            first division size (if > 1.0, sizes increase, if < 1.0, sizes
            decrease).  If negative, |SPACE| is nominal ratio of center
            division(s) size to end divisions size.  Ratio defaults to 1.0
            (uniform spacing). For layer-meshing, a value of 1.0 normally is
            used. If SPACE = FREE, ratio is determined by other considerations

        kforc
            KFORC 0-3 are used only with NL1 = ALL.  Specifies which selected
            lines are to be modified.

            0 - Modify only selected lines having undefined (zero) divisions.

            1 - Modify all selected lines.

            2 - Modify only selected lines having fewer divisions (including zero) than
                specified with this command.

            3 - Modify only selected lines having more divisions than specified with this
                command.

            4 - Modify only nonzero settings for SIZE, ANGSIZ, NDIV,  SPACE, LAYER1, and
                LAYER2.  If KFORC = 4, blank or 0 settings remain unchanged.

        layer1
            Layer-meshing control parameter.  Distance which defines the
            thickness of the inner mesh layer, LAYER1.  Elements in this layer
            are uniformly-sized with edge lengths equal to the specified
            element size for the line (either through SIZE or line-
            length/NDIV).  A positive value for LAYER1 is interpreted as an
            absolute length, while a negative value in interpreted as a
            multiplier on the specified element size for the line.  As a
            general rule, the resulting thickness of the inner mesh layer
            should be greater than or equal to the specified element size for
            the line.  If LAYER1 = OFF, layer-meshing control settings are
            cleared for the selected lines.  The default value is 0.0

        layer2
            Layer-meshing control parameter.  Distance which defines the
            thickness of the outer mesh layer, LAYER2.  Elements in this layer
            transition in size from those in LAYER1 to the global element size.
            A positive value of LAYER2 is interpreted as an absolute length,
            while a negative value is interpreted as a mesh transition factor.
            A value of LAYER2 = -2 would indicate that elements should
            approximately double in size as the mesh progresses normal to
            LAYER1. The default value is 0.0.

        kyndiv
            0, No, and Off means that SmartSizing cannot override specified
            divisions and spacing ratios. Mapped mesh fails if divisions do not
            match. This defines the specification as "hard".

        compname
            Component name containing one node to be used as the pole node for
            generating INFIN257 structural infinite elements. The pole node is
            generally located at or near the geometric center of the finite

            is ignored.

        Notes
        -----
        The EINFIN command generates structural infinite elements (INFIN257)
        directly from the selected face of valid base elements (existing
        standard elements in your model). The command scans all base elements
        for the selected nodes and generates a compatible infinite element type
        for each base element. A combination of different base element types is
        allowed if the types are all compatible with the infinite elements.

        The infinite element type requires no predefinition (ET).

        The faces of base elements are determined from the selected node set
        (NSEL), and the geometry of the infinite element is determined based on
        the shape of the face. Element characteristics and options are
        determined according to the base element. For the face to be used, all
        nodes on the face of a base element must be selected

        Use base elements to model the near-field domain that interacts with
        the solid structures or applied loads. To apply the truncated far-field
        effect, a single layer of infinite elements must be attached to the
        near-field domain. The outer surface of the near-field domain must be
        convex.

        After the EINFIN command executes, you can verify the newly created
        infinite element types and elements (ETLIST, ELIST, EPLOT).

        Infinite elements do not account for any subsequent modifications made
        to the base elements. It is good practice to issue the EINFIN command
        only after the base elements are finalized. If you delete or modify
        base elements, remove all affected infinite elements and reissue the
        EINFIN command; doing so prevents inconsistencies.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            The type of operation requested:

            DISP - Calculate the maximum and minimum possible displacement at each node in the

                     sector model.  Store the values and the phase angle at

            ALL - Calculate the maximum and minimum possible displacement, stress and strain at
                  each node in the original sector model.  Store the values and
                  the phase angle at which they occurred.

            GET - Places the value of a MAX or MIN item into the _CYCVALUE parameter, the node
                  for that value in the _CYCNODE parameter, and the phase angle
                  for the value in the _CYCPHASE parameter.

            PUT - Put resulting sweep values for printing (via the PRNSOL command ) or plotting
                  (via the PLNSOL command).

            LIST - List the current minimum/maximum displacement, stress and strain nodal values.

            STAT - Summarize the results of the last phase sweep.

            CLEAR - Clear phase-sweep information from the database.

        option
            If TYPE = DISP, STRAIN, STRESS or ALL, controls the sweep angle
            increment to use in the search:

            Angle - The sweep angle increment in degrees, greater than 0.1 and less than 10. The
                    default is 1.

        Notes
        -----
        When you expand the results of a modal cyclic symmetry analysis (via
        the /CYCEXPAND or EXPAND command), ANSYS combines the real and
        imaginary results for a given nodal diameter, assuming no phase shift
        between them; however, the modal response can occur at any phase shift.

        CYCPHASE response results are valid only for the first cyclic sector.
        To obtain the response at any part of the expanded model, ANSYS, Inc.
        recommends using cyclic symmetry results expansion at the phase angle
        obtained via CYCPHASE.

        The phase angles returned by CYCPHASE contain the minimum and maximum
        values for USUM, SEQV and other scalar principal stress and strain
        quantities; however, they do not always return the true minimum and
        maximum values for directional quantities like UX or SX unless the
        values fall in the first sector.

        CYCPHASE does not consider midside node values when evaluating maximum
        and minimum values, which may affect DISPLAY quantities but no others.
        (Typically, ANSYS ignores midside node stresses and strains during
        postprocessing.)

        Issuing CYCPHASE,PUT clears the result values for midside nodes on high
        order elements; therefore, this option sets element faceting (/EFACET)
        to 1. The command reports that midside nodal values are set to zero and
        indicates that element faceting is set to 1.

        If the sweep values are available after issuing a CYCPHASE,PUT command,
        the PRNSOL or PLNSOL command will print or plot (respectively) the
        sweep values of structure displacement Ux, Uy, Uz, component
        stress/strain X, Y, Z, XY, YZ, ZX, principal stress/strain 1, 2, 3 and
        equivalent stress/strain EQV.  The vector sum of displacement (USUM)
        and stress/strain intensity (SINT) are not valid phase-sweep results.

        You can specify any coordinate system via the RSYS command for
        displaying or printing CYCPHASE results. However, after CYCPHASE

        APDL Command: CYCOPT

        Specifies solution options for a cyclic symmetry analysis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            One of the following options:

            BCMULT - Controls whether cyclic sector array parameter names are reused or created new
                     for multiple entities.

            Value1 - The flag value.

            0 (OFF or NO) - Create new array parameter names (default)

            1(ON or YES) - Reuse array parameter names

            COMBINE - For linear static cyclic symmetry analysis with non-cyclically symmetric
                      loading only, expands and combines all harmonic index
                      solutions and writes them to the results file during the
                      solution phase of the analysis.

            Value1 - The flag value.

            0 (OFF or NO) - Disable combining of harmonic index solutions (default)

            1 (ON or YES) - Enable combining of harmonic index solutions

            DEFAULT - Set the default cyclic solution settings.

            DOF - The degrees of freedom to couple from the nodes on the low sector boundary to
                  nodes on the high boundary:

            Value1 - The component pair ID number.

            Value2, Value3, Value4,  . . . ,  Value7 - The constraint-equation/-coupling degree of freedom (DOF) for this pair. Repeat
                              the command to add other DOFs. The default is
                              constraint-equation/-coupling all applicable
                              DOFs.

            FACETOL - Tolerance for inclusion of surface nodes into your basic sector. Autodetect
                      defaults to 15°, accommodating most sections. Specify a
                      new Value1 only when extreme cut angles or complex model
                      geometry cause surface nodes to be excluded. See Notes
                      (below) for more information.

            ANSYS, Inc. recommends that successful auto-detection depends more on the value of ANGTOL than the value of FACETOL. Please refer to CYCOPT Auto Detection Tolerance Adjustments for Difficult Cases for more information about auto-detection and the CYCOPT command. - Value1

            The face tolerance applies only to auto detection from node/element models (already meshed and no solid model), and it defaults to 15°.   - HINDEX

            The harmonic index solution ranges for modal or buckling cyclic symmetry analyses. The SOLVE command initiates a cyclic symmetry solution sequence at the harmonic indices specified. (By default, the SOLVE command solves for all available harmonic indices.) Static and harmonic cyclic symmetry solutions always use all harmonic indices required for the applied loads. - EVEN / ODD

            For low-frequency electromagnetic analysis only, EVEN specifies a symmetric solution and ODD specifies an antisymmetric solution.  - The value you specify is based on the harmonic index: EVEN (default) indicates
                              harmonic index = 0, and ODD indicates harmonic
                              index = N / 2 (where N is an integer representing
                              the number of sectors in 360°). A value of ODD
                              applies only when N is an even number.

            The CYCOPT command with this HINDEX option is cumulative. To remove an option (for example, EVEN), issue this command: CYCOPT,HINDEX,EVEN,,,-1 - ALL

            Solve all applicable harmonic indices. - Note:  Value2 must be blank.

            Value1, Value2, Value3 - Solve harmonic indices in range Value1 through Value2 in steps of Value3.
                              Repeat the command to add other ranges. The
                              default solves all applicable harmonic indices.

            Value4 - The only valid value is -1. If specified, it removes Value1 through Value2 in
                     steps of Value3 from the set to solve. By default, if
                     Value4 = -1 then Value1 = 0, Value2 = 0, and Value3 = 1.

            Value5 - For static and harmonic analyses, the tolerance for determining if a Fourier
                     contribution of a load contributes to the response
                     (default = 1.0E-5).

            If Value5=STATIC, it forces the program to solve only the specified harmonic indices (even if a load may have a Fourier contribution in an index not specified). - LDSECT

            Restricts subsequently defined force loads and surface loads to a specified sector. The restriction remains in effect until you change or reset it. This option is not available for harmonic analyses based on mode-superposition (CYCOPT,MSUP,1) - Value1

            The sector number. A value other than 0 (default) is valid for a cyclic symmetry analysis with non-cyclically symmetric loading only. A value of 0 (or ALL) resets the default behavior for cyclic loading (where the loads are identical on all sectors). - MOVE

            Specifies if the program should move high- or low-edge component nodes paired within the specified tolerance (TOLER) to create precisely matching pairs.  - Value1

            The flag value. - 0

            Do not move edge component nodes (default) - 1 or HIGH

            Move the high-edge component nodes to precisely match the low-edge component nodes - -1 or LOW

            Move the low-edge component nodes to precisely match the high-edge component nodes - MSUP

            For modal cyclic symmetry analysis only, this flag is used to limit the results written to the Jobname.MODE and Jobname.RST files in preparation for a subsequent mode-superposition-based analysis. In a linear perturbation modal analysis, this option must be specified in the first load step of the preceding base analysis.  - m       c   l   a   s   s   =   "   r   e   p   l   a   c   e   a   b   l   e

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Equation solver type:

            SPARSE - Sparse direct equation solver.  Applicable to real-value or complex-value
                     symmetric and unsymmetric matrices. Available only for
                     STATIC, HARMIC (full method only), TRANS (full method
                     only), SUBSTR, and PSD spectrum analysis types [ANTYPE].
                     Can be used for nonlinear and linear analyses, especially
                     nonlinear analysis where indefinite matrices are
                     frequently encountered. Well suited for contact analysis
                     where contact status alters the mesh topology. Other
                     typical well-suited applications are: (a) models
                     consisting of shell/beam or shell/beam and solid elements
                     (b) models with a multi-branch structure, such as an
                     automobile exhaust or a turbine fan. This is an
                     alternative to iterative solvers since it combines both
                     speed and robustness. Generally, it requires considerably
                     more memory (~10x) than the PCG solver to obtain optimal
                     performance (running totally in-core). When memory is
                     limited, the solver works partly in-core and out-of-core,
                     which can noticeably slow down the performance of the
                     solver. See the BCSOPTION command for more details on the
                     various modes of operation for this solver.

            This solver can be run in shared memory parallel or distributed memory parallel (Distributed ANSYS) mode. When used in Distributed ANSYS, this solver preserves all of the merits of the classic or shared memory sparse solver. The total sum of memory (summed for all processes) is usually higher than the shared memory sparse solver. System configuration also affects the performance of the distributed memory parallel solver. If enough physical memory is available, running this solver in the in-core memory mode achieves optimal performance. The ideal configuration when using the out-of-core memory mode is to use one processor per machine on multiple machines (a cluster), spreading the I/O across the hard drives of each machine, assuming that you are using a high-speed network such as Infiniband to efficiently support all communication across the multiple machines.  - This solver supports use of the GPU accelerator capability.

            JCG - Jacobi Conjugate Gradient iterative equation solver. Available only for STATIC,
                  HARMIC (full method only), and TRANS (full method only)
                  analysis types [ANTYPE]. Can be used for structural, thermal,
                  and multiphysics applications. Applicable for symmetric,
                  unsymmetric, complex, definite, and indefinite matrices.
                  Recommended for 3-D harmonic analyses in structural and
                  multiphysics applications. Efficient for heat transfer,
                  electromagnetics, piezoelectrics, and acoustic field
                  problems.

            This solver can be run in shared memory parallel or distributed memory parallel (Distributed ANSYS) mode. When used in Distributed ANSYS, in addition to the limitations listed above, this solver only runs in a distributed parallel fashion for STATIC and TRANS (full method) analyses in which the stiffness is symmetric and only when not using the fast thermal option (THOPT). Otherwise, this solver runs in shared memory parallel mode inside Distributed ANSYS. - This solver supports use of the GPU accelerator capability. When using the GPU
                              accelerator capability, in addition to the
                              limitations listed above, this solver is
                              available only for STATIC and TRANS (full method)
                              analyses where the stiffness is symmetric and
                              does not support the fast thermal option (THOPT).

            ICCG - Incomplete Cholesky Conjugate Gradient iterative equation solver. Available for
                   STATIC, HARMIC (full method only), and TRANS (full method
                   only) analysis types [ANTYPE].  Can be used for structural,
                   thermal, and multiphysics applications, and for symmetric,
                   unsymmetric, complex, definite, and indefinite matrices. The
                   ICCG solver requires more memory than the JCG solver, but is
                   more robust than the JCG solver for ill-conditioned
                   matrices.

            This solver can only be run in shared memory parallel mode. This is also true when the solver is used inside Distributed ANSYS. - This solver does not support use of the GPU accelerator capability.

            QMR - Quasi-Minimal Residual iterative equation solver. Available for the HARMIC
                  (full method only) analysis type [ANTYPE]. Can be used for
                  high-frequency electromagnetic applications, and for
                  symmetric, complex, definite, and indefinite matrices. The
                  QMR solver is more stable than the ICCG solver.

            This solver can only be run in shared memory parallel mode. This is also true when the solver is used inside Distributed ANSYS. - This solver does not support use of the GPU accelerator capability.

            PCG - Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient iterative equation solver (licensed from
                  Computational Applications and Systems Integration, Inc.).
                  Requires less disk file space than SPARSE and is faster for
                  large models. Useful for plates, shells, 3-D models, large
                  2-D models, and other problems having symmetric, sparse,
                  definite or indefinite matrices for nonlinear analysis.
                  Requires twice as much memory as JCG. Available only for
                  analysis types [ANTYPE] STATIC, TRANS (full method only), or
                  MODAL (with PCG Lanczos option only). Also available for the
                  use pass of substructure analyses (MATRIX50). The PCG solver
                  can robustly solve equations with constraint equations (CE,
                  CEINTF, CPINTF, and CERIG).  With this solver, you can use
                  the MSAVE command to obtain a considerable memory savings.

            The PCG solver can handle ill-conditioned problems by using a higher level of difficulty (see PCGOPT). Ill-conditioning arises from elements with high aspect ratios, contact, and plasticity. - This solver can be run in shared memory parallel or distributed memory parallel
                              (Distributed ANSYS) mode. When used in
                              Distributed ANSYS, this solver preserves all of
                              the merits of the classic or shared memory PCG
                              solver. The total sum of memory (summed for all
                              processes) is about 30% more than the shared
                              memory PCG solver.

        toler
            Iterative solver tolerance value. Used only with the Jacobi
            Conjugate Gradient, Incomplete Cholesky Conjugate Gradient, Pre-
            conditioned Conjugate Gradient, and Quasi-Minimal Residual equation
            solvers. For the PCG solver, the default is 1.0E-8. The value
            1.0E-5 may be acceptable in many situations. When using the PCG
            Lanczos mode extraction method, the default solver tolerance value
            is 1.0E-4. For the JCG and ICCG solvers with symmetric matrices,
            the default is 1.0E-8. For the JCG and ICCG solvers with
            unsymmetric matrices, and for the QMR solver, the default is
            1.0E-6. Iterations continue until the SRSS norm of the residual is
            less than TOLER times the norm of the applied load vector. For the
            PCG solver in the linear static analysis case, 3 error norms are
            used. If one of the error norms is smaller than TOLER, and the SRSS
            norm of the residual is smaller than 1.0E-2, convergence is assumed
            to have been reached. See Iterative Solver in the Mechanical APDL
            Theory Reference for details.

        mult
            Multiplier (defaults to 2.5 for nonlinear analyses; 1.0 for linear
            analyses) used to control the maximum number of iterations
            performed during convergence calculations. Used only with the Pre-
            conditioned Conjugate Gradient equation solver (PCG). The maximum
            number of iterations is equal to the multiplier (MULT) times the
            number of degrees of freedom (DOF). If MULT is input as a negative
            value, then the maximum number of iterations is equal to abs(MULT).
            Iterations continue until either the maximum number of iterations
            or solution convergence has been reached. In general, the default
            value for MULT is adequate for reaching convergence.  However, for
            ill-conditioned matrices (that is, models containing elements with
            high aspect ratios or material type discontinuities) the multiplier
            may be used to increase the maximum number of iterations used to
            achieve convergence.  The recommended range for the multiplier is
            1.0 MULT 3.0.  Normally, a value greater than 3.0 adds no further
            benefit toward convergence, and merely increases time requirements.
            If the solution does not converge with 1.0 MULT 3.0, or in less
            than 10,000 iterations, then convergence is highly unlikely and
            further examination of the model is recommended. Rather than
            increasing the default value of MULT, consider increasing the level
            of difficulty (Lev_Diff) on the PCGOPT command.

        keepfile

        APDL Command: LVSCALE

        Scales the load vector for mode-superposition analyses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fact
            Scale factor applied to both the real and imaginary (if they exist)
            components of the load vector. Defaults to 0.0.

        ldstep
            Specifies the load step number from the modal analysis
            (MODCONT,ON). It corresponds to the load vector number. Defaults to
            1. The maximum value is 240.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the scale factor for the load vector that was created in a
        modal (ANTYPE,MODAL) analysis.  Applies only to the mode-superposition
        transient analysis (ANTYPE,TRANS), mode-superposition harmonic analysis
        (ANTYPE,HARMIC), random vibration analysis (ANTYPE,SPECTR with
        SPOPT,PSD), and multiple point response spectrum analysis
        (ANTYPE,SPECTR with SPOPT,MPRS).  For PSD and MPRS analyses, LVSCALE is
        only applicable for pressure loading.

        The LVSCALE command supports tabular boundary conditions (%TABNAME_X%)
        for FACT input values only as a function of time in the mode-
        superposition transient (ANTYPE,TRANS) or as a function of frequency in
        mode-superposition harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC).

        MPC contact generates constraint equations that can include constant
        terms (included on the right-hand side of the system equation). The
        LVSCALE command scales the constant terms.

        In mode-superposition transient and harmonic analyses, all of the load
        vectors need to be scaled in the first load step. Use a zero scale
        factor if they are not actually used in this first load step. :
        Similarly, in random vibration and multipoint response spectrum
        analyses, all of the load vectors need to be scaled in the first
        participation factor calculation (PFACT). : Use a zero scale factor if
        they are not actually used for the first input table.

        mode-superposition methods (ANTYPE,HARMIC or TRANS) or substructuring
        (ANTYPE,SUBSTR).

        For ANTYPE,TRANS, NUM, evenly spaced solutions are expanded between
        time BEGRNG and time ENDRNG.

        For ANTYPE,HARMIC, NUM, evenly spaced solutions are expanded between
        frequency BEGRNG and frequency ENDRNG.

            BASIC - Basic quantities (nodal DOF solution, nodal reaction loads, and element
                    solution) (default).

            NSOL - Nodal DOF solution.

            RSOL - Nodal reaction loads.

            ESOL - Element solution.

            NLOAD - Element nodal loads. When nonlinear stabilization is active, the stabilization
                    force/moments are also printed.

            SFOR - Stabilization force/moment at the applicable nodes (valid only when nonlinear
                   stabilization is active).

            VENG - Element energies. When nonlinear stabilization is active, the energy
                   dissipation due to stabilization is also printed.

            V - Nodal velocity (applicable to structural transient analysis  only
                (ANTYPE,TRANS)).

            A - Nodal acceleration (applicable to structural transient analysis only
                (ANTYPE,TRANS)).

            ALL - All of the above solution items.

        freq
            Print solution for this item every Freqth (and the last) substep of
            each load step.  If -n, print up to n equally spaced solutions
            (only applies to static or full transient analyses when automatic
            time stepping is enabled).  If NONE, suppress all printout for this
            item for this load step.  If ALL, print solution for this item for
            every substep.  If LAST, print solution for this item only for the
            last substep of each load step.  For a modal analysis, use NONE or
            ALL.

        cname
            Name of the component, created with the CM command, defining the
            selected set of nodes or elements for which this specification is
            active.  If blank, the set is all entities.

        Notes

        Controls the solution items to be printed, the frequency with which
        they are printed (in static, transient, or full harmonic analyses), and
        the set of nodes or elements to which this specification applies (in
        static, transient, or full harmonic analyses).  An item is associated
        with either a node (NSOL, RFORCE, V, and A items) or an element (all of
        the remaining items).  The specifications are processed in the order
        that they are input.  Up to 50 specifications (OUTPR and  OUTRES
        commands combined) may be defined.  Use OUTPR,STAT to list the current
        specifications and use OUTPR,ERASE to erase all the current
        specifications.

        As described above, OUTPR writes some or all items (depending on
        analysis type) for all elements.  To restrict the solution printout,
        use OUTPR to selectively suppress (Freq = NONE) the writing of solution
        data, or first suppress the writing of all solution data
        (OUTPR,ALL,NONE) and then selectively turn on the writing of solution
        data with subsequent OUTPR commands.

        the change of fiber length at the ending point during deformation and
        the rotation of the ending plane about X and Y during deformation will
        be printed if any displacement at the nodes is printed. The reaction
        forces at the ending point will be printed if any reaction force at the
        nodes is printed.

        Nodal reaction loads (Item = RSOL) are processed according to the
        specifications listed for the PRRSOL command.

        will be created with boundaries that conform to the area of

        Parameters

        na1, na2, ninc
            Set of areas (NA1 to NA2 in steps of NINC) that defines the pattern
            to be extruded.  NA2 defaults to NA1, NINC defaults to 1.  If NA1 =

        dx, dy, dz
            Increments to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates in

            DΦ for spherical).

        rx, ry, rz
            Scale factors to be applied to the X, Y, and Z keypoint coordinates
            in the active coordinate system (RR, Rθ, RZ for cylindrical; RR,
            Rθ, RΦ for spherical).  Note that the Rθ and RΦ scale factors are
            interpreted as angular offsets.  For example, if CSYS = 1, RX, RY,
            RZ input of (1.5,10,3) would scale the specified keypoints 1.5
            times in the radial and 3 times in the Z direction, while adding an
            offset of 10 degrees to the keypoints.  Zero, blank, or negative
            scale factor values are assumed to be 1.0.  Zero or blank angular
            offsets have no effect.

        Notes
        -----
        Generates additional volumes (and their corresponding keypoints, lines,
        and areas) by extruding and scaling a pattern of areas in the active
        coordinate system.

        If element attributes have been associated with the input area via the
        AATT command, the opposite area generated by the VEXT operation will
        also have those attributes (i.e., the element attributes from the input
        area are copied to the opposite area).  Note that only the area
        opposite the input area will have the same attributes as the input
        area; the areas adjacent to the input area will not.

        If the areas are meshed or belong to meshed volumes, a 3-D mesh can be
        extruded with this command.  Note that the NDIV argument on the ESIZE
        command should be set before extruding the meshed areas.

        Scaling of the input areas, if specified, is performed first, followed
        by the extrusion.

        In a non-Cartesian coordinate system, the VEXT command locates the end
        face of the volume based on the active coordinate system.  However, the
        extrusion is made along a straight line between the end faces.  Note
        that solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is not recommended.

        Caution:: : Use of the VEXT command can produce unexpected results when
        operating in a non-Cartesian coordinate system.  For a detailed
        description of the possible problems that may occur, see Solid Modeling

            CABLE - Cable properties (valid for LINK167).  VAL1 is optional input (see Notes).

            ORTHO - Defines a material coordinate system for the orthotropic material model (valid
                    for PLANE162, SHELL163, SOLID164, and SOLID168) or the
                    anisotropic material model (valid for SOLID164 and

            FLUID - Fluid properties (valid for PLANE162, SOLID164, and SOLID168). VAL1 is optional
                    input (see Notes).

        mat
            Material reference number (defaults to the current MAT setting on
            MAT command).

        val1, val2, val3, . . . , val6
            Additional input for specified Lab material property. The meaning
            of VAL1 through VAL6 will vary, depending on Lab. See the table
            below for VAL1 through VAL6 definitions.

            VAL1 - Hourglass control type. For solid elements (PLANE162, SOLID164, and SOLID168),
                   5 options are available. For quadrilateral shell and
                   membrane elements (SHELL163) with reduced integration, the
                   hourglass control is based on the formulation of Belytschko
                   and Tsay; i.e., options 1-3 are identical and options 4-5
                   are identical.

            0, 1 - Standard LS-DYNA viscous form (default).

            2 - Flanagan-Belytschko viscous form.

            3 - Flanagan-Belytschko viscous form with exact volume integration for solid
                elements.

            4 - Flanagan-Belytschko stiffness form.

            5 - Flanagan-Belytschko stiffness form with exact volume integration for solid
                elements.

            VAL2 - Hourglass coefficient. (Defaults to 0.1.) Values greater than 0.15 may cause
                   instabilities. The recommended default applies to all
                   options.  The stiffness forms can stiffen the response
                   (especially if deformations are large) and, therefore,

                   elements, the value input for VAL1 is the membrane hourglass
                   coefficient. VAL5 and VAL6 can also be input, but generally
                   VAL2 = VAL5 = VAL6 is adequate.

            VAL3 - Quadratic bulk viscosity coefficient. (Defaults to 1.5.)

            VAL4 - Linear bulk viscosity coefficient. (Defaults to 0.06.)

            VAL5 - Hourglass coefficient for shell bending. (Defaults to VAL2.)

        Notes
        -----
        DNSOL can be used only with FULL graphics activated (/GRAPHICS,FULL);
        it will not work correctly with PowerGraphics activated.

        DNSOL defines or modifies solution results in the database at a node.
        For example, DNSOL,35,U,X,.001,.002,.001 assigns values 0.001, 0.002,
        and 0.001 to UX, UY, and UZ (respectively) for node 35.  All results
        that are changed in the database, including the nodal degree of freedom
        results, are available for all subsequent operations.   All data is
        stored in the solution coordinate system, but will be displayed in the
        results coordinate system [RSYS].  Use the PRNSOL command to list the
        current results.

        Data input by DNSOL is stored in temporary space and does not replace
        information in the database. Therefore, data input by this command may
        be overwritten if a change is made to the selected set of nodes.

        Issuing the DNSOL command or its GUI equivalent requires you to place
        the data type (stress/strain) in the element nodal records.  To get
        around this requirement, use the DESOL command or equivalent path to
        add a "dummy" element stress/strain record.

        Result items are available depending on element type; check the
        individual element for availability. Valid item and component labels
        for element results are:

        -----
        The block of commands following the *DO command (up to the *ENDDO
        command) is executed repeatedly until some loop control is satisfied.
        Printout is automatically suppressed on all loops after the first

        rmshky
            Remesh flag option:

            0 - Remesh the selected non-structural areas only if mesh morphing fails.

            1 - Remesh the selected non-structural areas and bypass mesh morphing.

            2 - Perform mesh morphing only and do not remesh.

        Notes
        -----
        The selected areas should include only non-structural regions adjacent
        to structural regions. DAMORPH will morph the non-structural areas to
        coincide with the deflections of the structural regions.

        Nodes in the structural regions move in accordance with computed
        displacements. Displacements from a structural analysis must be in the
        database prior to issuing DAMORPH.

        By default, nodes attached to lines can move along the lines, or off
        the lines (if a line is interior to the selected areas). You can use
        XLINE to restrain nodes on certain lines.

        By default (RMSHKEY = 0), DAMORPH will remesh the selected non-
        structural areas entirely if a satisfactory morphed mesh cannot be
        provided.

        If boundary conditions and loads are applied directly to nodes and
        elements, the DAMORPH command requires that these be removed before
        remeshing can take place.

        Exercise care with initial conditions defined by the IC command. Before
        a structural analysis is performed for a sequentially coupled analysis,
        the DAMORPH command requires that initial conditions be removed from
        all null element type nodes in the non-structural regions. Use ICDELE

        Conditionally causes commands to be read.

        Parameters
        ----------
        val1
            First numerical value (or parameter which evaluates to a numerical
            value) in the conditional comparison operation.  VAL1, VAL2, VAL3,
            and VAL4 can also be character strings (enclosed in quotes) or
            parameters for Oper = EQ and NE only.

        oper1
            Operation label.  A tolerance of 1.0E-10 is used for comparisons
            between real numbers:

            Equal (for VAL1 = VAL2). - Not equal (for VAL1 ≠ VAL2).

            Less than (for VAL1 < VAL2). - Greater than (for VAL1 > VAL2).

            Less than or equal (for VAL1   VAL2). - Greater than or equal (for VAL1   VAL2).

            Absolute values of VAL1 and VAL2 before < operation. - Absolute values of VAL1 and VAL2 before > operation.

        val2
            Second numerical value (or parameter which evaluates to a numerical
            value) in the conditional comparison operation.

        base1
            Action based on the logical expression (Oper1) being true.  If
            false, continue reading at the next line. This is conditional,
            except for the IF-THEN-ELSE constructs described below; any of the
            following constructs (through Base1 = THEN) cause all subsequent
            fields to be ignored:

            A user-defined label (beginning with a colon (:), 8 characters maximum).  The command reader will skip (and wrap to the beginning of the file, if necessary) to the first line that begins with the matching :label. - Caution:   This label option may not be mixed with do-loop or if-then-else
                              constructs.

            This action will cause an exit from the ANSYS program at this line, unless running in interactive mode. In interactive mode, the program will not stop. - Exit the current do-loop [*EXIT].

            Skip to the end of the current do-loop [*CYCLE]. - Make this *IF an if-then-else construct (see below).

        val3
            Third numerical value (or parameter which evaluates to a numerical
            value).

        oper2
            Operation label. This will have the same labels as Oper1, except it
            uses Val3 and Val4. A tolerance of 1.0E-10 is used for comparisons
            between real numbers.

        val4
            Fourth numerical value (or parameter value which evaluates to a
            numerical value).

        base2
            Action based on the logical expression (Oper1 and Oper2) being
            true. They will be the same values as Base1, except as noted.

        Notes
        -----
        Conditionally causes commands to be read from a specific block or at a
        specific location.  Twenty levels of nested *IF blocks are allowed.
        Jumping to a :label line is not allowed with keyboard entry.  Jumping
        into, out of, or within a do-loop or an if-then-else construct to a
        :label line is not allowed. Using *IF interactively or from the command
        line prevents rereading the file to find a label. To do so, use batch
        mode or /INPUT.

        The following is an example of an if-then-else construct:

        *IF,VAL1,Oper,VAL2,THEN

        ----

        *ELSEIF,VAL1,Oper,VAL2

        ----

        *ELSEIF,VAL1,Oper,VAL2

        ----

        *ELSE

        ----

        *ENDIF

        where "----" represents a block of any number of commands.  Any number
        of *ELSEIF clauses (or none) may be included (in the location shown).
        One *ELSE clause (at most) may be included (in the location shown).
        The *IF command is executed by evaluating its logical expression.  If
        it is true, the block of commands following it is executed.  The
        construct is considered to be complete and the command following the
        *ENDIF is executed next.  If the logical expression is false, the next
        *ELSEIF command (if any) following the block is executed.  The
        execution logic is the same as for *IF.  The effect is that the logical
        expressions in the *IF and the *ELSEIF commands are sequentially tested
        until one is found to be true.  Then the block of commands immediately
        following the expression is executed, which completes the execution of
        the if-then-else construct.  If all *IF and *ELSEIF expressions are
        false, the block following the *ELSE command is executed, if there is
        one.  Only one block of commands (at most) is executed within the if-
        then-else construct.  If a batch input stream hits an end-of-file
        during a false *IF condition, the ANSYS run will not terminate
        normally. You will need to terminate it externally (use either the
        Linux “kill” function or the Windows task manager). The *IF, *ELSEIF,
        *ELSE, and *ENDIF commands for each if-then-else construct must all be
        read from the same file (or keyboard).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        APDL Command: SLOAD

        Load a pretension section.

        Parameters
        ----------
        secid
            Unique section number. The number must already be assigned to a
            pretension section.

        plnlab
            Label representing the pretension load sequence number in the
            format "PLnn" where nn is an integer from 1 through 99 (for
            example, PL01 through PL99).

        kinit
            Initial action key for pretension load PL01. (This field is omitted
            for PL02 and up.) Three scenarios are possible:

            LOCK - Constrains (connects) the cutting plane on the pretension section. This value
                   is the default.

            SLID - Unconstrains (disconnects) the cutting plane on the pretension section.

            TINY - Applies a very small pretension load (0.1% of FDVALUE) before the desired load
                   is established. The small load prevents convergence problems
                   which can occur when the desired load is not established in
                   the first load step. This value is valid only if KFD = FORC.

        kfd
            Force/Displacement key. Specifies whether FDVALUE is a force or a
            displacement:

            FORC - Apply a force on the specified pretension section. This value is the default.

            DISP - Apply a displacement (adjustment) on the specified pretension section.

        fdvalue
            Pretension load value. If KFD = FORC, this value is a pretension
            force. If KFD = DISP, this value is a pretension displacement
            (adjustment).

        lsload
            Load step in which to apply the FDVALUE.

        lslock
            The load step in which the displacement value resulting from the
            pretension force is locked. This value is valid only if KFD = FORC.

        Notes
        -----
        The SLOAD command applies pretension loads to specified pretension
        sections (created via the PSMESH command). A pretension load is ramp-
        applied (KBC = 0) if it is a force (KFD = FORC), and step-applied (KBC
        = 1) if it is a displacement (KFD = DISP).

        You can “lock” the load value at a specified load step. When locked,
        the load changes from a force to a displacement, and ANSYS applies the
        load as a constant displacement in all future load steps. Locking is
        useful when applying additional loadings. The additional loadings alter
        the effect of the initial load value, but because locking transforms
        the load into a displacement, it preserves the initial load's effect.

        In modal and harmonic analyses, any pretension load (force,
        displacement, or locked) is ignored and no load is produced.

        The following command shows how to establish loads on a pretension
        section:

        SLOAD,1,PL01,TINY,FORC,5000,2,3

        In this example, the load is applied to pretension section 1, and the
        sequence begins with the initial action key, KINIT, set to TINY. A
        small stabilization load (5 = 0.10% of 5000) is applied in the first
        load step, as the actual pretension force is not applied until the
        second load step. The next four fields set the actual load: the KFD
        value FORC specifies the type of load, FDVALUE defines the pretension
        load value (5000), LSLOAD specifies the load step in which the force is
        applied (2), and the LSLOCK field specifies the load step in which the
        force is locked (3). Additional sets of four fields can be used to
        define additional loads.

        You can use the SLOAD command to edit (overwrite) existing loads on a
        pretension section. This example changes the load on pretension section
        1 (set above) to 6000:

        SLOAD,1,PL01,,,6000,2,3

        Unspecified values (blank fields), as shown in this example, remain
        unchanged from prior settings. If no prior specifications exist, then
        default values (KINIT = LOCK and KFD = FORC) apply.

        The command can also delete all loads on a specified pretension
        section, as shown here:

        SLOAD,1,DELETE

        For a prestressed modal analysis, this command locks the pretension
        element:

        SLOAD,1,PL01,LOCK,DISP,0,1,2

        Allows the user to set a marker in the database indicating the system
        of units used.  The setting may be reviewed with the /STATUS command at
        the Begin level.  The units label and conversion factors on this
        command are for user convenience only and have no effect on the
        analysis or data.  That is, /UNITS will not convert database items from
        one system to another (e.g., from U. S. Customary to SI, etc.).  The
        units setting will be written to the file of IGES data [IGESOUT or
        CDWRITE], which can then be read by many programs that read IGES files.
        The user must still use consistent units for the results to be valid.

        If you choose the MKS system of units, the EPZRO option for the EMUNIT
        command is set to 8.85 e-12 F/m.  (EPZRO specifies alternate free-space
        permittivity.)

        For micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), where dimensions are on the
        order of microns, see the conversion factors in System of Units in the
        Coupled-Field Analysis Guide.

        If you use the ANSYS ADAMS Interface to export model information to the
        ADAMS program, the /UNITS command is required to ensure the correct
        transfer of data between ANSYS and ADAMS. You may choose a predefined
        unit system label (Label = SI, CGS, etc.) or you can select the user-
        defined system option (Label = USER) and input the appropriate
        conversion factors (LENFACT, MASSFACT, TIMEFACT, and FORCEFACT). The
        conversion factors will be written to the ADAMS input file Jobname.MNF
        in order to correctly generate the load. For more information, see
        Export to ADAMS in the Substructuring Analysis Guide.

        All differences between the base solution units used by the ANSYS and
        CFX solvers will be noted in the ANSYS output file.   Unit conversions
        are automatically applied to all loads transferred unless Label = USER.
        Unit conversions are not applied to any of the loads transferred
        between the ANSYS and CFX solvers if they use a user-defined unit
        system.

        APDL Command: *DIM

        Defines an array parameter and its dimensions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        par
            Name of parameter to be dimensioned.  See *SET for name
            restrictions.

        type
            Array type:

            Arrays are similar to standard FORTRAN arrays (indices are integers) (default).  Index numbers for the rows, columns, and planes are sequential values beginning with one. Used for 1-, 2-, or 3-D arrays. - Same as ARRAY, but used to specify 4-D arrays.

            Same as ARRAY, but used to specify 5-D arrays. - Array entries are character strings (up to 8 characters each).  Index numbers
                              for rows, columns, and planes are sequential
                              values beginning with one.

            Array indices are real (non-integer) numbers which must be defined when filling the table.  Index numbers for the rows and columns are stored in the zero column and row "array elements" and are initially assigned a near-zero value.  Index numbers must be in ascending order and are used only for retrieving an array element.  When retrieving an array element with a real index that does not match a specified index, linear interpolation is done among the nearest indices and the corresponding array element values [*SET]. Used for 1-, 2-, or 3-D tables. - Same as TABLE, but used to specify 4-D tables.

            Same as TABLE, but used to specify 5-D tables. - Array entries are character strings (up to IMAX each). Index numbers for
                              columns and planes are sequential values
                              beginning with 1. Row index is character position
                              in string.

        imax
            Extent of first dimension (row). (For Type = STRING, IMAX is
            rounded up to the next multiple of eight and has a limit of 248).
            Defaults to 1.

        jmax
            Extent of second dimension (column).  Defaults to 1.

        kmax
            Extent of third dimension (plane).  Defaults to 1.

        var1
            Variable name corresponding to the first dimension (row) for Type =
            TABLE.  Defaults to Row.

        var2
            Variable name corresponding to the second dimension (column) for
            Type = TABLE.  Defaults to Column.

        var3
            Variable name corresponding to the third dimension (plane) for Type
            = TABLE.  Defaults to Plane.

        csysid
            An integer corresponding to the coordinate system ID Number.

        Notes
        -----
        Up to three dimensions (row, column, and plane) may be defined using
        ARRAY and TABLE.  Use ARR4, ARR5, TAB4, and TAB5 to define up to five
        dimensions (row, column, plane, book, and shelf). An index number is
        associated with each row, column, and plane.  For array and table type
        parameters, element values are initialized to zero.  For character and
        string parameters, element values are initialized to (blank).  A
        defined parameter must be deleted [*SET] before its dimensions can be
        changed.  Scalar (single valued) parameters should not be dimensioned.
        *DIM,A,,3 defines a vector array with elements A(1), A(2), and A(3).
        *DIM,B,,2,3 defines a 2x3 array with elements B(1,1), B(2,1), B(1,2),
        B(2,2), B(1,3), and B(2,3).  Use *STATUS,Par to display elements of
        array Par. You can write formatted data files (tabular formatting) from
        data held in arrays through the *VWRITE command.

        If you use table parameters to define boundary conditions, then Var1,
        Var2, and/or Var3 can either specify a primary variable (listed in
        Table: 130:: *DIM - Primary Variables) or can be an independent
        parameter.  If specifying an independent parameter, then you must
        define an additional table for the independent parameter.  The
        additional table must have the same name as the independent parameter
        and may be a function of one or more primary variables or another
        independent parameter.  All independent parameters must relate to a
        primary variable.

        Tabular load arrays can be defined in both global Cartesian (default)
        or local (see below) coordinate systems by specifying CSYSID, as
        defined in LOCAL. For batch operations, you must specify your
        coordinate system first.

        The following constraints apply when you specify a local coordinate
        system for your tabular loads:

        If you are specifying a 4- or 5-D array or table, four additional
        fields (LMAX, MMAX, Var4, and Var5) are available. Thus, for a 4-D
        table, the command syntax would be:

        For a 5-D table, the command syntax would be:

        You cannot create or edit 4- or 5-D arrays or tables using the GUI.

        See Array Parameters for a detailed discussion on and examples for
        using array parameters.

        Table: 130:: : *DIM - Primary Variables

        Specify PRESSURE as the independent variable (not PRES).

        The X, Y, and Z coordinate locations listed above are valid in global
        Cartesian, or local (Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical) coordinate
        systems. The VELOCITY label is applicable only to the calculated fluid
        velocity in element FLUID116.

        When using PRESSURE as a primary variable, the underlying element must
        have the pressure DOF associated with it, or it must be a supported
        contact element.

        The gap/penetration label (GAP) is only used for defining certain
        contact element real constants.

        The frequency label (FREQ) is valid for harmonic analyses only.

        The OMEGS, ECCENT, and THETA primary variables only apply to the
        COMBI214 element. The amplitude of the rotational velocity (OMEGS) is
        an absolute value, so only positive values of OMEGS are valid. The
        eccentricity (ECCENT) and phase shift (THETA) labels are only valid for
        nonlinear analyses.

        If you use table parameters to define boundary conditions, the table
        names (Par) must not exceed 32 characters.

        In thermal analyses, if you apply tabular loads as a function of
        temperature but the rest of the model is linear (e.g., includes no
        temperature-dependent material properties or radiation ), you should
        turn on Newton-Raphson iterations (NROPT,FULL) to evaluate the
        temperature-dependent tabular boundary conditions correctly.

        This command is valid in any processor.

            quotes in the EMTGEN command line.

        ecomp

            Defaults to EMTELM.

        pncomp
            Component name of the plane nodes generated by the command at an
            offset (GAP) from the surface nodes. You must enclose name-strings
            in single quotes in the EMTGEN command line. Defaults to EMTPNO.

        dof
            Active structural degree of freedom (DOF) for TRANS126 elements
            (UX, UY, or UZ) in the Cartesian coordinate system. You must
            enclose the DOF in single quotes.

        gap
            Initial gap distance from the surface nodes to the plane. Be sure
            to use the correct sign with respect to Ncomp node location.

        gapmin
            Minimum gap distance allowed (GAPMIN real constant) for TRANS126
            elements. Defaults to the absolute value of (GAP)*0.05.

        fkn
            Contact stiffness factor used as a multiplier for a contact
            stiffness appropriate for bulk deformation. Defaults to 0.1.

        epzero
            Free-space permittivity. Defaults to 8.854e-6 (μMKS units).

        Notes
        -----
        The EMTGEN command generates a set of TRANS126 elements between the
        surface nodes of a moveable structure and a plane of nodes, typically
        representing a ground plane. The plane of nodes are created by the
        command at a specified offset (GAP). Each element attaches to a surface
        node and to a corresponding node representing the plane. The created
        elements are set to the augmented stiffness method (KEYOPT(6) = 1),
        which can help convergence. The generated plane nodes should be
        constrained appropriately for the analysis.

        You can use TRANS126 elements for simulating fully coupled
        electrostatic structural coupling between a MEMS device and a plane, if
        the gap distance between the device and the plane is small compared to
        the overall surface area dimensions of the device. This assumption
        allows for a point-wise closed-form solution of capacitance between the
        surface nodes and the plane; i.e. CAP = EPZERO*AREA/GAP, where EPZERO
        if the free-space permittivity, AREA is the area associated with the
        node, and GAP is the gap between the node and the plane. The area for
        each node is computed using the ARNODE function in ANSYS. See the *GET
        command description for more information on the ARNODE function.

        With a distributed set of TRANS126 elements attached directly to the
        structure and a plane (such as a ground plane), you can perform a full
        range of coupled electrostatic-structural simulations, including:

        Static analysis (due to a DC voltage or a mechanical load)

        Prestressed modal analysis (eigenfrequencies, including frequency-shift
        effects of a DC bias voltage)

        Prestressed harmonic analysis (system response to a small-signal AC
        excitation with a DC bias voltage or mechanical load)

        Large signal transient analysis (time-transient solution due to an
        arbitrary time-varying voltage or mechanical excitation)

        The TRANS126 element also employs a node-to-node gap feature so you can
        perform contact-type simulations where the structure contacts a plane
        (such as a ground plane). The contact stiffness factor, FKN, is used to
        control contact penetration once contact is initiated. A smaller value
        provides for easier convergence, but with more penetration.

        Saves all current database information to a file (File.DB).  In
        interactive mode, an existing File.DB is first written to a backup file
        (File.DBB).  In batch mode, an existing File.DB is replaced by the
        current database information with no backup.  The command should be
        issued periodically to ensure a current file backup in case of a system
        "crash" or a "line drop."  It may also be issued before a "doubtful"
        command so that if the result is not what was intended the database may
        be easily restored to the previous state.  A save may be time consuming
        for large models.  Repeated use of this command overwrites the previous
        data on the file (but a backup file is first written during an
        interactive run).  When issued from within POST1, the nodal boundary
        conditions in the database (which were read from the results file) will
        overwrite the nodal boundary conditions existing on the database file.

        Internal nodes may be created during solution (for example, via the
        mixed u-P formulation or generalized plane strain option for current-
        technology elements, the Lagrangian multiplier method for contact
        elements or the MPC184 elements, or the quadratic or cubic option of
        the BEAM188 and PIPE288 elements). It is sometimes necessary to save
        the internal nodes in the database for later operations, such as
        cutting boundary interpolations (CBDOF) for submodeling. To do so,
        issue the SAVE command after the first SOLVE command.

            Radius of the circle.  If RAD is blank and PCENT = P, the radius is
            the distance from PCENT to PZERO.

        paxis
            Keypoint defining axis of circle (along with PCENT).  If PCENT = P
            and PAXIS is omitted, the axis is normal to the working plane.

        pzero

        boundaries for the selected nodes and elements. For example, PLNSOL,S,X
        displays the X component of stress S (that is,  the SX stress
        component). Various element results depend upon the recalculation
        method and the selected results location [AVPRIN, RSYS, LAYER, SHELL,
        and NSEL].  Contours are determined by linear interpolation within each
        element from the nodal values, which are averaged at a node whenever

            Valid operations are:

            ZERO - Zero results portion of database (LCASE1 ignored).

            SQUA - Square database values (LCASE1 ignored).

            SQRT - Square root of database (absolute) values (LCASE1 ignored).

            ADD - Add LCASE1 to database values.

            SUB - Subtract LCASE1 from database values.

            SRSS - Square root of the sum of the squares of database and LCASE1.

            MIN - Compare and save in database the algebraic minimum of database and LCASE1.

            MAX - Compare and save in database the algebraic maximum of database and LCASE1.

            ABMN - Compare and save in database the absolute minimum of database and LCASE1 (based

            ABMX - Compare and save in database the absolute maximum of database and LCASE1 (based
                   on magnitudes, then apply the corresponding sign).

        lcase1
            First load case in the operation (if any).  See LCNO of the LCDEF
            command. If ALL, repeat operations using all selected load cases
            [LCSEL].

        oper2
            Valid operations are:

            MULT - Multiplication: LCASE1*LCASE2

            CPXMAX - This option does a phase angle sweep to calculate the maximum of derived
                     stresses and equivalent strain for a complex solution
                     where LCASE1 is the real part and LCASE2 is the imaginary
                     part. The Oper field is not applicable with  this option.
                     Also, the LCABS and SUMTYPE commands have no effect on
                     this option. The value of S3 will be a minimum.   This

        lcase2
            Second load case.  Used only with Oper2 operations.

        Notes
        -----
        LCOPER operates on the database and one or two load cases according to:

        Database = Database Oper (LCASE1 Oper2 LCASE2)

        where operations Oper and Oper2 are as described above.  Absolute
        values and scale factors may be applied to the load cases before the
        operations [LCABS, LCFACT].  If LCASE1 is not specified, only operation
        Oper is performed on the current database.  If LCASE2 is specified,
        operation Oper2 will be performed before operation Oper.  If LCASE2 is
        not specified, operation Oper2 is ignored.  Solution items not
        contained [OUTRES] in either the database or the applicable load cases
        will result in a null item during a load case operation.  Harmonic
        element data read from a result file load case are processed at zero
        degrees.  All load case combinations are performed in the solution
        coordinate system, and the data resulting from load case combinations
        are stored in the solution coordinate system.  The resultant data are
        then transformed to the active results coordinate system [RSYS] when
        listed or displayed. Except in the cases of Oper = LPRIN, ADD, or SUB,
        you must use RSYS,SOLU to list or display, and in the case of layered
        elements, the layer (LAYER) must also be specified.

        Use the FORCE command prior to any combination operation to correctly
        combine the requested force type.

        itype
            Arbitrary local element type number. Defaults to 1 + current
            maximum.

        ename
            Element name (or number) as given in the element library in Chapter
            4 of the Element Reference. The name consists of a category prefix
            and a unique number, such as PIPE288.  The category prefix of the
            name (PIPE for the example) may be omitted but is displayed upon
            output for clarity. If Ename = 0, the element is defined as a null
            element.

        kop1, kop2, kop3, . . . , kop6
            KEYOPT values (1 through 6) for this element, as described in the

        inopr
            If 1, suppress all element solution printout for this element type.

        Notes
        -----
        The ET command selects an element type from the element library and
        establishes it as a local element type for the current model.
        Information derived from the element type is used for subsequent
        commands, so the ET command(s) should be issued early. (The Element
        Reference describes the available elements.)

        A special option, Ename = 0, permits the specified element type to be
        ignored during solution without actually removing the element from the
        model. Ename may be set to zero only after the element type has been
        previously defined with a nonzero Ename.  The preferred method of
        ignoring elements is to use the select commands (such as ESEL).

        KOPn are element option keys. These keys (referred to as KEYOPT(n)) are
        used to turn on certain element options for this element. These options
        are listed under "KEYOPT" in the input table for each element type in
        the Element Reference.  KEYOPT values include stiffness formulation
        options, printout controls, and various other element options. If
        KEYOPT(7) or greater is needed, input their values with the KEYOPT
        command.

        The ET command only defines an element type local to your model (from
        the types in the element library). The TYPE or similar [KATT, LATT,
        AATT, or VATT] command must be used to point to the desired local
        element type before meshing.

        To activate the ANSYS program's LS-DYNA explicit dynamic analysis
        capability,  use the ET command or its GUI equivalent to choose an
        element that works only with LS-DYNA (such as SHELL163).  Choosing LS-
        DYNA in the Preferences dialog box does not activate LS-DYNA; it simply
        makes items and options related to LS-DYNA accessible in the GUI.

        Notes
        -----
        ANHARM invokes an ANSYS macro which produces an animated sequence of:

        Time-harmonic results in the case of a harmonic analysis
        (ANTYPE,HARMIC)

        Complex mode shapes in the case of a modal analysis (ANTYPE,MODAL).

        In both cases, the results are those of the last plot action (for
        example, PLNSOL,B,SUM).

        The animation converts the complex solution variables (real and
        imaginary sets) into time varying results over one period. For example,
        if NFRAM = 12, then the frame captures are in increments of 30 degree
        phase angles.

        A second set of NFRAM frames will be generated for damped eigenmodes
        from complex eigensolvers to visualize any exponential decay or growth
        of the oscillations. The second set generated will display frames from
        the period number specified by NPERIOD.

        In a CMS analysis, the ANHARM command can be used after the CMS
        expansion pass or the use pass. To use ANHARM after the expansion pass,
        you must indicate whether a modal analysis or a harmonic analysis was
        performed in the CMS use pass by setting CMS_ANTYPE to either MODAL or
        HARMIC. If the use pass was a modal analysis, you must also set the
        CMS_MODOPT field to indicate the mode extraction method that was used
        (UNSYM, DAMP, or QRDAMP). If CMS_MODOPT = QRDAMP, it is assumed that
        CPXMOD was set to ON in the MODOPT command to request complex
        eigenmodes. If the ANHARM command is used after the use pass, it is not
        necessary to set the CMS_ANTYPE or CMS_MODOPT arguments.

            The name (case-sensitive) of the superelement matrix file created
            by the substructure generation pass (Sename.SUB).  Defaults to the
            current Jobname.  If a number, it is the element number of a
            previously defined superelement in the current use pass.

        ncomp
            Symmetry key:

            X - X symmetry (default).

            Y - Y symmetry.

            Z - Z symmetry.

        inc
            Increment all nodes in the superelement by INC.

        file
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        Performs a symmetry operation on a superelement within the substructure
        use pass by reversing the sign of component Ncomp in the global
        Cartesian coordinate system.  The node numbers are incremented by INC.
        The new superelement is written to File.SUB in the current directory
        (by default).  All master node nodal coordinate systems must be global
        Cartesian (no rotated nodes allowed).

        The maximum number of transformations for a given superelement is five
        (including SETRAN, SESYMM, and the large rotation transformation if
        NLGEOM is ON in the use pass).

        Controls graphics options on subsequent displays.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label
            Apply display items as selected from the following labels:

            INFO - Controls the display of the legend (ON or OFF) and allows the choice of preset
                   or Multi-legend placement. Control is provided by the KEY
                   values. (Defaults to KEY=3 when the GUI is on. Defaults to
                   KEY= 2 otherwise.)

            LEG1 - Header portion of legend column (defaults to ON).

            LEG2 - View portion of legend column (defaults to ON (except off with contour
                   displays)).

            LEG3 - View the contour section of the legend column (defaults to ON).

            FRAME - Frame border lines around windows (defaults to ON).

            TITLE - Title (bottom left text) (defaults to ON).

            MINM - Min-Max symbols on contour displays (defaults to ON).

            LOGO - ANSYS logo (defaults to OFF (displayed as text at top of legend column)).  If
                   KEY = ON, the text is removed from legend column but the
                   logo symbol is displayed in whichever active window is
                   either in the uppermost right corner and on top, or if there
                   is no window in that location, then in the window to the
                   furthest right of the screen.  Version information remains
                   in the legend column.

            WINS - Controls whether graphics windows automatically stretch or shrink to adjust to
                   screen size as the legend column is turned off or on
                   [/PLOPTS,INFO] (defaults to ON).  If WINS is on and the
                   legend column is changed from off to on, all windows are
                   shrunk regardless of what their correct size is.

            WP - Working plane (defaults to OFF).  The working plane is drawn as part of the
                 display (not just an overlaid image as in WPSTYL).  This
                 option is best used in combination with a hidden-line
                 technique [/TYPE].

            DATE - Controls the display of the date and time in your legend. Subsequent KEY values
                   control the display as follows:

            FILE - Controls the display of the ANSYS jobname in your legend. Subsequent KEY values
                   control the display as follows:

        key
            Switch:

            OFF or 0 - Do not apply this display item. For Label = DATE, no time or date are
                       displayed.

            ON or 1 - Apply this display item. For Label = DATE, show only the date.

            AUTO or 2 - For Label = INFO, initiate Auto-legend mode.  If the display has contours, the
                        legend is ON; if the display has no contours, the
                        legend is OFF. For Label = DATE, display both the date
                        and time.

            3 - For Label = INFO , switch to Multi-legend mode. See the /UDOC command for the
                available legend configurations.

        Notes
        -----
        Use /PLOPTS,STAT to display settings.  Use /PLOPTS,DEFA to reset all
        specifications back to their defaults.

        When you perform multiple results displays, contours on the legend
        column may be truncated.  To avoid this, specify /PLOPTS,LEG1,0.

        Notes
        -----
        Local coordinate systems defined by this command are used in an
        explicit dynamic analysis. For example, a local coordinate system may
        be used when defining orthotropic material properties (see EDMP).

        The coordinate system is defined by 2 vectors, one from the origin (X3,
        Y3, Z3) to a point on the x-axis (X1, Y1, Z1), and one from the origin
        to a point on the x-y plane (X2, Y2, Z2).  The cross product of these
        two vectors determines the z-axis, and the cross product of the z-axis
        vector and x-axis vector determines the y-axis. If X3, Y3, and Z3 are
        not specified, the global origin (0,0,0) is used by default (as shown
        in the figure below).

        The x-axis vector and the xy vector should be separated by a reasonable
        angle to avoid numerical inaccuracies.

        When you use the local coordinate system (defined by the EDLCS command)
        to define a load (EDLOAD command), the direction of the load will
        depend on the load type. For force and moment loads (Lab = FX, MX, etc.
        on EDLOAD), the load will be applied in the direction of the local
        coordinate system defined by EDLCS. For prescribed motion degrees of
        freedom (Lab = UX, ROTX, VX, AX, etc. on EDLOAD), the motion will act
        in the direction of a vector from point (X1, Y1, Z1) to point (X2, Y2,

        chgbnd
            Specifies whether to allow boundary modification.  Boundary
            modification includes such things as changes in the connectivity of
            the element faces on the boundary and the addition of boundary
            nodes.  (Also see "Notes" below for important usage information for
            CHGBND.)

            0 - Do not allow boundary modification.

        implevel
            Identifies the level of improvement to be performed on the
            elements.  (Improvement occurs primarily through the use of face
            swapping and node smoothing techniques.)

            0 - Perform the least amount of swapping/smoothing.

            1 - Perform an intermediate amount of swapping/smoothing.

            2 - Perform the greatest amount of swapping/smoothing.

            3 - Perform the greatest amount of swapping/smoothing, plus additional improvement
                techniques (default).

        Notes
        -----
        VIMP is useful for further improving a volume mesh created in ANSYS
        [VMESH], especially quadratic tetrahedral element meshes.

        The VIMP command enables you to improve a given tetrahedral mesh by
        reducing the number of poorly-shaped tetrahedral elements (in
        particular, the number of sliver tetrahedral elements)--as well as the
        overall number of elements--in the mesh.  It also improves the overall
        quality of the mesh.

        Regardless of the value of the CHGBND argument, boundary mid-nodes can
        be moved.

        When loads or constraints have been placed on boundary nodes or mid-
        nodes, and boundary mid-nodes are later moved, ANSYS issues a warning
        message to let you know that it will not update the loads or
        constraints.

        Even when CHGBND = 1, no boundary modification is performed on areas
        and lines that are not modifiable (for example, areas that are adjacent
        to other volumes or that contain shell elements, or lines that are not
        incident on modifiable areas, contain beam elements, or have line
        divisions specified for them [LESIZE]).

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Label identifying the type of volume select:

            S - Select a new set (default).

            R - Reselect a set from the current set.

            A - Additionally select a set and extend the current set.

            U - Unselect a set from the current set.

        vlkey

        Parameters
        ----------
        anum
            Area number having the normal direction that the reoriented areas
            are to match.

        noeflip
            Indicates whether you want to change the normal direction of the
            existing elements on the reoriented area(s) so that they are
            consistent with each area's new normal direction.

            0 - Make the normal direction of existing elements on the reoriented area(s)
                consistent with each area's new normal direction (default).

            1 - Do not change the normal direction of existing elements on the reoriented
                area(s).

        Notes
        -----
        Reorients areas so that their normals are consistent with that of a
        specified area.

        If any of the areas have inner loops, the ANORM command will consider
        the inner loops when it reorients the area normals.

        You cannot use the ANORM command to change the normal direction of any
        element that has a body or surface load.  We recommend that you apply
        all of your loads only after ensuring that the element normal
        directions are acceptable.

        Real constants (such as nonuniform shell thickness and tapered beam
        constants) may be invalidated by an element reversal.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wn
            Window number whose viewing direction will be modified to be normal
            to the working plane (defaults to 1).  If WN is a negative value,
            the viewing direction will not be modified.  If fewer than three

            Keypoint number defining the x-axis orientation (defaults to the
            x-axis being parallel to the global X-axis; or if the normal to the
            working plane is parallel to the global X-axis, then defaults to

            (blank) - The resulting volumes will share area(s) where they touch.

            SEPO - The resulting volumes will have separate, but coincident area(s).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates new volumes by subtracting the intersection of the working
        plane from the NV volumes.  The intersection will be an area(s).  If
        SEPO is blank, the volume is divided at the area and the resulting
        volumes will be connected, sharing a common area where they touch.  If
        SEPO is set to SEPO, the volume is divided into two unconnected volumes
        with separate areas.  The SEPO option may cause unintended consequences

        structure from the excitation frequency f, defined (via the HARFRQ
        command) as Ω = 2πf / RATIO. The rotational velocity is applied along
        the direction cosines of the rotation axis (specified via an OMEGA or
        CMOMEGA command).

        Specifying any value for RATIO causes a general rotational force
        excitation and not an unbalance force. To define an unbalance
        excitation force (F = Ω2 * Unb), RATIO should be left blank (the nodal
        unbalance Unb is specified via the F command).

        The SYNCHRO command is valid only for a full-solution harmonic analysis
        (HROPT,Method = FULL) and the Variational Technology method
        (HROPT,Method = VT) involving a rotating structure (OMEGA or CMOMEGA)
        with Coriolis enabled in a stationary reference frame
        (CORIOLIS,,,,RefFrame = ON).

            θ2, Z2 for cylindrical, or R2,  θ2, Φ2 for spherical or toroidal.

        Notes
        -----
        Calculates and moves a node to an intersection location.  The node may
        have been previously defined (at an approximate location) or left
        undefined (in which case it is internally defined at the SOURCE
        location).  The actual location is calculated from the intersection of
        three surfaces (implied from three coordinate constants in two
        different coordinate systems).  The three (of six) constants easiest to
        define should be used.  The program will calculate the remaining three
        coordinate constants.  All arguments, except KC1, must be input.  Use
        the repeat command [*REPEAT] after the MOVE command to define a line of
        intersection by repeating the move operation on all nodes of the line.

        Surfaces of constant value are implied by some commands by specifying a
        single coordinate value.  Implied surfaces are used with various
        commands [MOVE, KMOVE, NSEL, etc.].  Three surfaces are available with
        each of the four coordinate system types.  Values or X, Y, or Z may be
        constant for the Cartesian coordinate system; values of R,: θ, or Z for
        the cylindrical system; and values of R, θ,: Φ for the spherical and
        toroidal systems.  For example, an X value of 3 represents the Y-Z
        plane (or surface) at X=3.  In addition, the parameters for the
        cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems may be adjusted [CS,
        LOCAL] to form elliptical surfaces.  For surfaces in elliptical
        coordinate systems, a surface of "constant" radius is defined by the
        radius value at the X-axis.  Surfaces of constant value may be located
        in local coordinate systems [LOCAL, CLOCAL, CS, or CSKP] to allow for
        any orientation.

        The intersection calculation is based on an iterative procedure (250
        iterations maximum) and a tolerance of 1.0E-4.  The approximate
        location of a node should be sufficient to determine a unique
        intersection if more than one intersection point is possible.  Tangent
        "intersections" should be avoided.  If an intersection is not found,
        the node is placed at the last iteration location.

        This command is also valid in the /MAP processor.

            Arbitrary reference number assigned to this variable (2 to NV
            [NUMVAR]). Overwrites any existing results for this variable.

        node
            Node number for which data are to be stored.

        item
            Label identifying the item. General item labels are shown in
            Table 126: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels below. Some
            items also require a component label.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required). General component labels are
            shown in Table 126: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels
            below.

        name

            of elements with the specified element type name. DEFAULT: Use all
            elements in the active set unless Mat and/or Real is specified.

        Notes
        -----
        Valid item and component labels for averaged nodal results are listed
        in Table: 126:: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels, below.

        All element nodal quantities are obtained in RSYS, Solu and then
        averaged.

        The ANSOL command defines averaged nodal results data to be stored from
        a results file [FILE]. Not all items are valid for all nodes. See the
        input and output summary tables of the Element Reference of each
        element that is attached to the node for the available items.

        COORDINATE SYSTEMS: All element nodal results used by ANSOL for
        averaging are in the element coordinate system, except for layered
        elements. Layered element results are in the layer coordinate system.
        You can further specify the element nodal results, for some elements,
        with the SHELL, LAYERP26, and FORCE commands.

        ANSOL does not transform results from RSYS, SOLU to other coordinate
        systems. Verify that all elements attached to the subject node have the
        same coordinate system before using ANSOL.

        SHELL ELEMENTS: The default shell element coordinate system is based on
        node ordering. For shell elements the adjacent elements could have a
        different RSYS,SOLU, making the resultant averaged data inconsistent. A
        note to this effect is issued when ANSOL is used in models containing
        shell elements. Ensure that consistent coordinate systems are active
        for all associated elements used by the ANSOL command.

        DERIVED QUANTITIES: Some of the result items supported by ANSOL (see
        Table: 126:: ANSOL - General Item and Component Labels) are derived
        from the component quantities. Use AVPRIN to specify the principal and
        vector sum quantity averaging methods.

        DEFAULT: If Mat, Real , and Ename are not specified, all of the
        elements attached to the node will be considered. When a material ID,
        real constant ID, or element type discontinuity is detected at a node,
        a note is issued. For example, in a FSI analysis, a FLUID30 element at
        the structure interface would be considered. But since it contains no
        SX result, it will not be used during STORE operations.

        label
            Device function label:

            BBOX - Disables display information sorting for PowerGraphics displays. When activated
                   (KEY = 1 or ON), model rotations and replots are performed
                   without recalculating edge and surface data. This will speed
                   up the rotation (especially for 2-D displays) of large
                   models, although the display information will not be
                   resolved as quickly (you will see a bounding box instead of
                   the model during dynamic rotations). The default is OFF (KEY
                   = 0).

            DITHER - Dithering.  When turned on (default), dithering smooths transitions in color
                     intensity.  Applies only to Z-buffered displays.

            FONT - Font selection for the ANSYS graphics window.  When Label = FONT, the command
                   format is: /DEVDISP,FONT,KEY,Val1,Val2,Val3,VAL4,Val5,Val6,
                   where KEY determines the type of font being controlled, and
                   values 1 through 6 control various font parameters. Note
                   that these values are device specific; using the same
                   command input file [/INPUT] on different machines may yield
                   different results.The following KEY values determine the
                   font information that will be supplied to the appropriate
                   driver (e.g., Postscript, X11, Win32, JPEG, ...):

            KEY = 1 - The command controls the LEGEND (documentation column) font.

            KEY = 2 - The command controls the ENTITY (node and keypoint number) font.

            KEY = 3 - The command controls the ANNOTATION/GRAPH font.

            Linux: Values 1 through 4 are used to find a match in the X11 database of font strings.  Values 1, 2, and 3 are character strings; value 4 is a nonzero integer:    - Val1

            Family name (e.g., Courier*New). Substitute an asterisk (*) for any blank character that appears in a family name. If Val1 = MENU, all other values are ignored, and a font selection menu appears (GUI must be active).  - Val2

            Weight (e.g., medium) - Val3

            Slant (e.g., r) - Val4

            Pixel size (e.g., 14). Note that this value does not affect the annotation fonts (KEY = 3). Use the /TSPEC command to control the pixel size of your annotation fonts.  - Val5

            unused - Val6

            unused - PC: The values are encoded in a PC logical font structure.  Value 1 is a
                     character string, and the remaining values are integers:

            Val1 - Family name (e.g., Courier*New) Substitute an asterisk (*) for any blank
                   character that appears in a family name. If Val1 = MENU, all
                   other values are ignored and a font selection menu appears
                   (GUI must be active). A value containing all blank
                   characters causes ANSYS to use the first available resource
                   it finds.

            Val2 - Weight (0 - 1000)

            Val3 - Orientation (in tenths of a degree)

            Val4 - Height (in logical units) Note that this value does not affect the annotation
                   fonts (KEY =3). Use the /TSPEC command to control the height
                   of your annotation fonts.

            Val5 - Width (in logical units)

            Val6 - Italics (0 = OFF, 1 = ON)

            TEXT - Text size specification for the ANSYS Graphics window. When Label = TEXT, the
                   command format is: /DEVDISP,TEXT,KEY,PERCENT, where KEY
                   determines the type of text being controlled (1 for LEGEND,

        APDL Command: PERBC2D

        Generates periodic constraints for 2-D planar magnetic field analyses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc1
            Constant coordinate location of the first plane of nodes.  For
            PLNOPT = 1 or 2, the constant coordinate location is the global
            Cartesian coordinate system [CSYS,0] location in the X or Y
            direction respectively.  For PLNOPT = 0, the location is the angle
            in the global cylindrical coordinate system [CSYS,1].

        loc2
            Constant coordinate location of the second plane of nodes.  For
            PLNOPT  = 1 or 2, the constant coordinate location is the global
            Cartesian coordinate system [CSYS,0] location in the X or Y
            direction respectively.  For PLNOPT = 0, the location is the angle
            (in degrees) in the global cylindrical coordinate system [CSYS,1].

        loctol
            Tolerance on the constant coordinate location for node selection.
            Defaults to .00001 for PLNOPT  = 1 or 2 and .001 degrees for PLNOPT
            = 0.

        r1
            Minimum coordinate location along the second plane of nodes.  For
            PLNOPT = 1 or 2, the coordinate location is the global Cartesian
            coordinate system location in the Y or X direction respectively.
            For PLNOPT = 0, the coordinate location is the radial coordinate
            value in the global cylindrical coordinate system.   Periodic
            conditions are not applied to nodes at this location.

        r2
            Maximum coordinate location along the second plane of nodes.  For
            PLNOPT = 1 or 2, the coordinate location is the global Cartesian
            coordinate system location in the Y or X direction respectively.
            For PLNOPT = 0, the coordinate location is the radial coordinate
            value in the global cylindrical coordinate system. Periodic
            conditions are not applied to nodes at this location.

            Defaults to .00001.

        opt
            Periodic option:

            0 - Odd symmetry (default).  Apply constraint equations such that AZ(i) = -AZ(j).

            1 - Even symmetry.  Apply node coupling such that AZ(i) = AZ(j).

        plnopt
            Symmetry plane option:

            0 - Planes of constant angle in the global cylindrical coordinate system [CSYS,1].

            1 - Planes parallel to the global Cartesian X axis [CSYS,0].

            2 - Planes parallel to the global Cartesian Y axis [CSYS,0].

        Notes
        -----
        PERBC2D invokes an ANSYS macro which generates periodic boundary
        condition constraints for 2-D planar magnetic field analysis.  The
        macro is restricted to node pairs sharing common coordinate values
        along symmetry planes separated by a constant coordinate value.  Planes
        (or lines) must lie at either constant  angles (PLNOPT = 0), constant X
        values (PLNOPT = 1), or constant Y values (PLNOPT = 2).  PERBC2D
        applies constraint equations (OPT = 0, odd symmetry) or node coupling
        (OPT = 1, even symmetry) to each node pair sharing a common coordinate
        value along the symmetry planes.  By default, periodic conditions are
        not applied at the first and last node pairs on the symmetry planes
        unless the input location values, R1 and R2, are adjusted to be less
        than or greater than the actual node coordinate values.  Nodes are
        selected for application of the constraints using the NSEL command with
        tolerances on the constant coordinate location (LOCTOL) and the
        coordinate location along the plane (RTOL).

        Useful for offsetting current model data to prevent overlap if another

        ----------
        signif
            Combine only those modes whose significance level exceeds the

        This command is also valid in PREP7. This mode combination method is

        This CSM method is only applicable in a DDAM analysis (SPOPT,DDAM). The

        frequencies are within 10 percent of the common mean frequency and
        their responses are opposite in sign. The contribution of these closely
        spaced modes is then included in the NRL sum as a single effective
        mode. Refer to Closely Spaced Modes (CSM) Method in the Mechanical APDL

        one listed as a positive value indicates that the attribute was
        assigned with the LATT command (and will not be reset to zero if the
        mesh is cleared); one listed as a negative value indicates that the
        attribute was assigned using the attribute pointer [TYPE, MAT, REAL, or
        ESYS] that was active during meshing (and will be reset to zero if the
        mesh is cleared).

        This command is valid in any processor.

        APDL Command: AWAVE

        Specifies input data for an acoustic incident wave.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wavenum
            Wave number. You specify the integer number for an acoustic
            incident wave inside or outside the model.  The number must be
            between 1 and 20.

        wavetype
            Wave type:

            PLAN - Planar incident wave

            MONO - Monopole or pulsating sphere incident wave

            DIPO - Dipole incident wave

            BACK - Back enclosed loudspeaker

            BARE - Bare loudspeaker

            STATUS - Displays the status of the acoustic wave settings if Wavenum = a number between
                     1 and 20 or ALL.

            DELE - Deletes the acoustic wave settings if Wavenum = a number between 1 and 20 or
                   ALL.

        opt1
            PRES

            PRES - Pressure

            VELO - Velocity

        opt2
            EXT

            EXT - Incident wave outside the model.

            INT - Incident wave inside the model. This option is only available for pure
                  scattered pressure formulation.

        val1, val2, val3, . . . , val13
            If Wavetype = PLAN, MONO, DIPO, BACK, or BARE:

            VAL1 - Amplitude of pressure or normal velocity to the sphere surface.

            VAL2 - Phase angle of the applied pressure or velocity (in degrees). Defaults to 0
                   degrees.

        Notes
        -----
        Use the ASOL command to activate the scattered field algorithm and the
        ASCRES command for output control with the scattered field algorithm.

        APDL Command: SF

        Specifies surface loads on nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nlist
            Nodes defining the surface upon which the load is to be applied.
            Use the label ALL or P, or a component name.  If ALL, all selected
            nodes [NSEL] are used (default).  If P, graphical picking is
            enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in
            the GUI).

        lab
            Valid surface load label. Load labels are listed under "Surface
            Loads" in the input table for each element type in the Element
            Reference.

        value
            Surface load value or table name reference for specifying tabular
            boundary conditions.

        value2
            Second surface load value (if any).

        Notes
        -----
        Individual nodes may not be entered for this command.  The node list is
        to identify a surface and the Nlist field must contain a sufficient
        number of nodes to define an element surface.  The loads are internally
        stored on element faces defined by the specified nodes.  All nodes on
        an element face (including midside nodes, if any) must be specified for
        the face to be used, and the element must be selected.

        If all nodes defining a face are shared by an adjacent face of another
        selected element, the face is not free and will not have a load
        applied.  If more than one element can share the same nodes (for
        example, a surface element attached to a solid element), select the
        desired element type before issuing the SF command. The SF command
        applies only to area and volume elements.

        For shell elements, if the specified nodes include face one (which is
        usually the bottom face) along with other faces (such as edges), only
        face one is used.  Where faces cannot be uniquely determined from the
        nodes, or where the face does not fully describe the load application,
        use the SFE command.  A load key of 1 (which is typically the first
        loading condition on the first face) is used if the face determination
        is not unique.  A uniform load value is applied over the element face.

        See the SFBEAM command for applying surface loads to beam elements.
        See the SFGRAD command for an alternate tapered load capability.  See
        the SFFUN command for applying loads from a node vs. value function.

        subsequent CGROW commands necessary to define the parameters) for each
        crack.

        If the analysis is restarted (ANTYPE,,RESTART), the CGROW command must

        For VCCT crack growth:

        Crack-growth element components must use the crack tip nodes as the
        starting nodes of the crack path.

        Calculates the stress intensity factors (KI, KII, and KIII) associated
        with homogeneous isotropic linear elastic fracture mechanics.  A
        displacement extrapolation method is used in the calculation (see POST1

        assumes that the displacement calculations are for the plane strain
        state. If the displacement calculations are performed using a plane
        stress formulation, the calculation of the stress intensity factors can
        be converted to the plane strain state by using KPLAN = 1. ANSYS Uses

        calculation, therefore the material's Poisson's ratio must be defined

            FIRST - Read the first data set (Sbstep and TIME are ignored).

            LAST - Read the last data set (Sbstep and TIME are ignored).

            NEXT - Read the next data set (Sbstep and TIME are ignored).  If at the last data set,
                   the first data set will be read as the next.

            PREVIOUS - Read the previous data set (Sbstep and TIME are ignored).  If at the first data
                       set, the last data set will be read as the previous.

            NEAR - Read the data set nearest to TIME (Sbstep is ignored).  If TIME is blank, read
                   the first data set.

            LIST - Scan the results files and list a summary of each load step (KIMG, TIME, ANGLE,
                   NSET, and ORDER are ignored.)

        sbstep
            Substep number within Lstep (defaults to the last substep of the
            load step). For a buckling (ANTYPE,BUCKLE) or modal (ANTYPE,MODAL)
            analysis, Sbstep corresponds to the mode number (defaults to the
            first mode). Specify Sbstep = LAST to store the last substep for
            the specified load step.

        fact
            Scale factor applied to data read from the files. If zero (or
            blank), a value of 1.0 is used. A nonzero factor excludes non-
            summable items. Harmonic velocities or accelerations may be
            calculated from the displacement results from a modal
            (ANTYPE,MODAL) or harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC) analysis. If Fact =
            VELO, the harmonic velocities (v) are calculated from the
            displacements (d) at a particular frequency (f) according to the
            relationship v = 2πfd. Similarly, if Fact = ACEL, the harmonic
            accelerations (a) are calculated as a = (2πf)2d.

        kimg
            Used only with complex results (harmonic and complex modal
            analyses).

            0 or REAL - Store the real part of a complex solution (default).

            1, 2 or IMAG - Store the imaginary part of a complex solution.

            3 or AMPL - Store the amplitude.

            4 or PHAS - Store the phase angle. The angle value, expressed in degrees, will be between
                        -180°  and +180°.

        time
            Time-point identifying the data set to be read. For a harmonic
            analysis, time corresponds to the frequency. For a buckling
            analysis, time corresponds to the load factor.  Used only in the
            following cases:  If Lstep = NEAR, read the data set nearest to
            TIME. If both Lstep and Sbstep are zero (or blank), read data set
            at time = TIME. If TIME is between two solution time points on the
            results file, a linear interpolation is done between the two data
            sets. Solution items not written to the results file (OUTRES) for
            either data set will result in a null item after data set
            interpolation. If TIME is beyond the last time point on the file,
            the last time point will be used.

        angle
            Circumferential location (0.0 to 360°). Defines the circumferential
            location for the harmonic calculations used when reading from the
            results file. The harmonic factor (based on the circumferential
            angle) is applied to the harmonic elements (PLANE25, PLANE75,
            PLANE78, PLANE83, and SHELL61) of the load case. See the Mechanical
            APDL Theory Reference for details. Note that factored values of
            applied constraints and loads will overwrite any values existing in
            the database.

        nset
            Data set number of the data set to be read. If a positive value for
            NSET is entered, Lstep, Sbstep, KIMG, and TIME are ignored.
            Available set numbers can be determined by RESCOMBINE,,,,LIST.

        order
            Key to sort the harmonic index results. This option applies to
            cyclic symmetry buckling and modal analyses only, and is valid only
            when Lstep = FIRST, LAST, NEXT, PREVIOUS, NEAR or LIST.

            ORDER  - Sort the harmonic index results in ascending order of eigenfrequencies or
                     buckling load multipliers.

            (blank)  - No sorting takes place.

        Notes
        -----
        RESCOMBINE is an ANSYS command macro that allows you to combine results
        from a distributed memory parallel (Distributed ANSYS) solution. In a
        distributed memory parallel solution, a global results file is saved by
        default. However, if you issued DMPOPTION,RST,NO in the parallel
        solution, no global results file is written and all local results files
        will be kept. In this case, you can use the RESCOMBINE command macro in
        the general postprocessor (/POST1) to read results into the database
        for postprocessing.

        In order to use the RESCOMBINE command, all local results files from
        the distributed memory parallel solution must be in the current working
        directory. If running on a single machine, the local results files are
        saved in the working directory by default. If running on a cluster, the
        local results files are kept in the working directory on each compute
        node. For this latter case, you must copy the local results files to
        the working directory on the primary compute node.

        Similar to the SET command, the RESCOMBINE command macro defines the
        data set to be read from the results files into the database. Various
        operations may also be performed during the read operation (see the SET
        command for more details). The database must have the model data
        available (or use the RESUME command before the RESCOMBINE command to
        restore the geometry from Jobname.DB).

        After a set of data is combined into the database using RESCOMBINE, the
        RESWRITE command can be used to write this set of data into a new
        results file. This new results file will essentially contain the
        current set of results data for the entire (i.e., global) model.

        Upon completion of the RESCOMBINE command macro, the current file for
        postprocessing (see the FILE command) is set to the last local results
        file specified by RESCOMBINE. For example, if reading in four local
        results files, the results file    f   o   r   a       h   r   e   f
        =   "   H   l   p   _   C   _   P   O   S   T   1   .   h   t   m   l

        APDL Command: PATH

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            Name for this path (eight characters maximum. If nPts is blank, set
            the current path to the path with this name. If nPts is greater
            than zero, create a path of this name. If a path with this name
            already exists, replace it with a new path. If the NAME value is
            STATUS, display the status for path settings.

        npts
            The number of points used to define this path.  The minimum number
            is two, and the maximum is 1000. Default is 2.

        nsets
            The number of sets of data which you can map to this path.  You
            must specify at least four:  X, Y, Z, and S.  Default is 30.

        ndiv
            The number of divisions between adjacent points.  Default is 20.
            There is no maximum number of divisions.

        Notes
        -----
        The PATH command is used to define parameters for establishing a path.
        The path geometry is created by the PPATH command.  Multiple paths may
        be defined and named; however, only one path may be active for data
        interpolation [PDEF] and data operations [PCALC, etc.].  Path geometry
        points and data are stored in memory while in POST1.  If you leave
        POST1, the path information is erased.  Path geometry and data may be
        saved in a file by archiving the data using the PASAVE command.  Path
        information may be restored by retrieving the data using the PARESU
        command.

        For overlapping nodes, the lowest numbered node is assigned to the
        path.

        The number of divisions defined using nDiv does NOT affect the number
        of divisions used by PLSECT and PRSECT.

        APDL Command: NREFINE

        Refines the mesh around specified nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nn1, nn2, ninc
            Nodes (NN1 to NN2 in increments of NINC) around which the mesh is
            to be refined.  NN2 defaults to NN1, and NINC defaults to 1.  If
            NN1 = ALL, NN2 and NINC are ignored and all selected nodes are used
            for refinement.  If NN1 = P, graphical picking is enabled and all
            remaining command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A
            component name may also be substituted for NN1 (NN2 and NINC are
            ignored).

        level
            Amount of refinement to be done.  Specify the value of LEVEL as an
            integer from 1 to 5, where a value of 1 provides minimal
            refinement, and a value of 5 provides maximum refinement (defaults
            to 1).

        depth
            Depth of mesh refinement in terms of number of elements outward
            from the indicated nodes (defaults to 1).

        post
            Type of postprocessing to be done after element splitting, in order
            to improve element quality:

            OFF - No postprocessing will be done.

            SMOOTH - Smoothing will be done.  Node locations may change.

            CLEAN - Smoothing and cleanup will be done.  Existing elements may be deleted, and node
                    locations may change (default).

        retain
            Flag indicating whether quadrilateral elements must be retained in
            the refinement of an all-quadrilateral mesh.  (The ANSYS program
            ignores the RETAIN argument when you are refining anything other
            than a quadrilateral mesh.)

            ON - The final mesh will be composed entirely of quadrilateral elements, regardless
                 of the element quality (default).

            OFF - The final mesh may include some triangular elements in order to maintain
                  element quality and provide transitioning.

        Notes
        -----
        NREFINE performs local mesh refinement around the specified nodes.  By
        default, the indicated elements are split to create new elements with
        1/2 the edge length of the original elements (LEVEL = 1).

        NREFINE refines all area elements and tetrahedral volume elements that
        are adjacent to the specified nodes.  Any volume elements that are
        adjacent to the specified nodes, but are not tetrahedra (for example,
        hexahedra, wedges, and pyramids), are not refined.

        You cannot use mesh refinement on a solid model that contains initial
        conditions at nodes [IC], coupled nodes [CP family of commands],
        constraint equations [CE family of commands], or boundary conditions or
        loads applied directly to any of its nodes or elements.  This applies
        to nodes and elements anywhere in the model, not just in the region
        where you want to request mesh refinement.  For additional restrictions
        on mesh refinement, see Revising Your Model in the Modeling and Meshing
        Guide.

        lab

            Maximum relaxation factor. Defaults to RFINI.

        Notes
        -----
        Use this command to relax the field solutions in fluid-solid
        interaction analyses and thermal-thermal analyses for a better
        convergence rate in coupled problems, especially cases that need
        dynamic relaxation. The ANSYS field that has the MFFR command applied
        will do only one nonlinear stagger iteration within each multi-field
        stagger; the convergence of the ANSYS field solver will be satisfied
        through multiple multi-field staggers. Note that the CFX field solver
        can have multiple iterations within the field solver; see the CFX
        documentation for more details. ANSYS will not terminate the nonlinear
        field solution until the ANSYS field solver converges or reaches the
        maximum number of multi-field staggers as specified on MFITER.

        The interface load relaxation (MFRELAX) will be automatically turned
        off for the corresponding surface loads that have MFFR applied. The
        automatic change of the relaxation factor for accelerating the
        nonlinear convergence of the coupled field solution is based on
        Aitken's acceleration scheme.

        This command is valid only with coupled problems involving surface load
        transfer only. No subcycling is allowed for the field solver if using
        this command.

        RACE invokes an ANSYS macro which defines a "racetrack" current source
        in the working plane coordinate system.  The current source is
        generated from bar and arc source primitives using the SOURC36 element
        (which is assigned the next available element type number).  The macro
        is valid for use in 3-D magnetic field analysis using a scalar
        potential formulation.  Current flows in a counterclockwise direction
        with respect  to the working plane.

        The diagram below shows you a racetrack current source.

            The type of analysis run from which stresses are imported.

            OFF - Ignore initial stresses.

            DYNA - Get initial stresses from an earlier explicit (ANSYS LS-DYNA) run (default).

            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        spscale
            Stabilization factor. This factor is used in a springback analysis
            to scale (up or down) the initial stiffness of the applied spring.
            No default; input a value only if you want to activate
            stabilization. If SPSCALE is blank, stabilization is not activated.

        mscale
            Acceptable stabilization stiffness (defaults to 1.0 X 10--4). In a
            springback analysis, iterations will stop when the applied spring
            stiffness comes down to this value. MSCALE is not used if SPSCALE
            is blank.

        Notes
        -----
        This command imports initial stress information into ANSYS from an
        earlier explicit (ANSYS LS-DYNA) run.  The stress state from SHELL163
        and SOLID164 elements in the explicit analysis is imported to the
        corresponding SHELL181 and SOLID185 implicit elements. For the shell
        elements, the current shell element thickness is also imported. This
        command is valid only before the first SOLVE command of the implicit
        analysis (which comes after the explicit analysis) and is ignored if
        issued after subsequent SOLVE commands (that is, stresses will not be
        re-imported).

        RIMPORT is typically used to perform springback analysis of sheet metal
        forming. We recommend that you use SHELL163 elements in the explicit
        analysis with 3 to 5 integration points through the thickness. This
        ensures that the through-thickness stress distribution is transferred
        accurately to the SHELL181 elements. If more than 5 integration points
        are used, ANSYS imports resultants (forces and moments) to the SHELL181
        elements. This implies that linearization of the through-thickness
        stress distribution is assumed in SHELL181 elements. If SHELL163 uses
        full integration in the shell plane, stress and thickness data are
        averaged and then transferred. For the solid elements, the stress at
        the SOLID164 element centroid is transferred to the SOLID185 element
        centroid. If SOLID164 has full integration, the stress is averaged and
        then transferred.

        When the  SPSCALE argument is specified, artificial springs with
        exponentially decaying stiffness (as a function of iterations) are
        applied. This technique is recommended only for those cases in which
        there are severe convergence difficulties. In general, you should first
        attempt a springback analysis without using the stabilization factors
        SPSCALE and MSCALE. (For more information on springback stabilization,
        see the ANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide.)

        This command is not written to the Jobname.CDB file when the CDWRITE
        command is issued. Further, the RIMPORT information is not saved to the
        database; therefore, the RIMPORT command must be reissued if the
        database is resumed.

        nstart
            Starting reference number assigned to the first variable. Allowed

            contact entity for which output is desired.

        step1, step2
            Load step range of data to be read in. If STEP1 and STEP2 are
            blank, all load steps are read in.

        Notes
        -----
        EDREAD reads data from the specified ascii output file so that it may
        be used during postprocessing. After EDREAD, you must issue the STORE
        command to store the data in time history variables. Once stored, the
        variables can be viewed as plots of output item versus time.

        The number of variables stored depends on the file specified. The
        following table shows the items in each file and the order in which
        they are stored.  If data items were previously stored in variables
        NSTART to NSTART+15, they will be overwritten. If more variables are
        needed, change NV on the NUMVAR command. (Note that hourglass energy
        will not be available if it was not specified for the model
        [EDENERGY,1].)

        The following items under MATSUM are listed in the MATSUM ASCII file
        (in the Mat no. field) for each part number at time intervals specified
        by the EDHTIME command. Use EDREAD,,MATSUM,NUM to specify the part
        number that corresponds to the mat number in the MATSUM file.

        Resultant contact forces and sliding interface energies are available
        from the RCFORC and SLEOUT files, respectively. The RCFORC file is
        written for surface based contact types that include target and contact
        (master and slave) definitions.  You should ensure that this file
        contains valid force results before issuing EDREAD,,RCFORC. Only the

        history postprocessing.

        Sums and prints, in each component direction for each selected node,

        usually zero except where constraints or loads are applied.  The nodal
        forces and moments may be displayed [/PBC,FORC and /PBC,MOME].  Use
        PRESOL to print nodal forces and moments on an element-by-element

        (static, damping, inertia, or total) of the nodal load is to be used.
        Nodal forces associated with surface loads are not included.

        This vector sum is printed in the global Cartesian system. Moment
        summations are about the global origin unless another point is
        specified with the SPOINT command.  The summations for each node are
        printed in the global Cartesian system unless transformed [RSYS].  This
        command is generally not applicable to axisymmetric models because
        moment information from the NFORCE command is not correct for
        axisymmetric elements.

        Selecting a subset of elements [ESEL] and then issuing this command
        will give the forces and moments required to maintain equilibrium of
        that set of elements.  The effects of nodal coupling and constraint

        vnum
            Number identifying volume for which elements are to be oriented (no

        option
            Option for defining element orientation:

                 numbers (KZ1 and KZ2) in fields VALUE1 and VALUE2,
                 respectively. The element z-axis points from KZ1 toward KZ2.
                 Element x and y directions point away from KZ1 along edges of
                 the volume to make a right-hand triad. (The element x- and
                 y-axes are uniquely determined by this specification.)

            LINE - Orientation is determined by one of the lines defining the volume. Input the
                   line number in field VALUE1. The element z direction follows
                   the direction of the line. Input a negative value if the
                   desired z direction is opposite to the direction of the

                   determined by this specification.) (VALUE2 is not used.)

            AREA - Orientation is determined by one of the areas defining the volume. The area
                   represents the desired element top surface. Input the area
                   number as VALUE1. The shortest line in the volume connected
                   to the area will be used to specify the element z direction.
                   (If more than one shortest line exists, the lowest numbered
                   of those is used.) Element x and y directions are not
                   uniquely specified by this option. (VALUE2 is not used.)

            THIN - Align the element z normal to the thinnest dimension of the volume. The
                   shortest line in the volume is used to specify the element z
                   direction. (If more than one shortest line exists, the

            Parameters required for the element z-axis direction specification.
            The meaning of VALUE1 and VALUE2 will depend on the chosen Option.
            See the description of Option above for details.

        Notes
        -----
        Use VEORIENT before the VMESH command to specify the desired
        orientation of brick elements in a mapped mesh. VEORIENT has no effect
        on tetrahedron meshes, extruded meshes (VROTAT, VDRAG, VEXT, etc.), or
        swept meshes (VSWEEP).

        Proper brick orientation is essential for certain element types such as
        SOLID185 Layered Solid, SOLID186 Layered Solid, and SOLSH190. In such
        cases, use VEORIENT or EORIENT to achieve the desired orientation. For
        other brick element types, you may need to specify element orientation
        to control orthotropic material property directions without concern for
        the element connectivity. For those cases, the ESYS command is the
        preferred method of specifying the material property directions.

        For Option = LINE, AREA, and THIN, the orientation will be internally
        converted to an equivalent Option = KP specification (KP,KZ1,KZ2). Use
        the VLIST command to view the element orientations (in terms of KZ1 and
        KZ2) associated with each volume.

        APDL Command: BFINT

        Activates the body force interpolation operation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname1
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including
            directory) from which to read data for interpolation. If you do not
            specify a directory path, it will default to your working directory
            and you can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext1
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        fname2
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including
            directory) to which BF commands are written. If you do not specify
            a directory path, it will default to your working directory and you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext2
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        kpos
            Position on Fname2 to write block of BF commands:

            0 - Beginning of file (overwrite existing file).

            1 - End of file (append to existing file).

        clab
            Label (8 characters maximum, including the colon) for this block of
            BF commands in Fname2.  This label is appended to the colon (:).
            Defaults to BFn, where n is the cumulative iteration number for the
            data set currently in the database.

        kshs
            Shell-to-solid submodeling key:

            0 - Solid-to-solid or shell-to-shell submodel.

            1 - Shell-to-solid submodel.

        tolout
            Extrapolation tolerance about elements, based on a fraction of the
            element dimension. Submodel nodes outside the element by more than
            TOLOUT are not accepted as candidates for DOF extrapolation.
            Defaults to 0.5 (50%).

        tolhgt
            Height tolerance above or below shell elements, in units of length.
            Used only for shell-to-shell submodeling (KSHS = 0). Submodel nodes
            off the element surface by more than TOLHGT are not accepted as
            candidates for DOF interpolation or extrapolation. Defaults to
            0.0001 times the maximum element dimension.

        Notes
        -----
        File Fname1 should contain a node list for which body forces are to be
        interpolated [NWRITE].  File Fname2 is created, and contains
        interpolated body forces written as a block of nodal BF commands.

        Body forces are interpolated from elements having TEMP as a valid body
        force or degree of freedom, and only the label TEMP is written on the
        nodal BF commands.  Interpolation is performed for all nodes on file
        Fname1 using the results data currently in the database. For layered
        elements, use the LAYER command to select the locations of the
        temperatures to be used for interpolation. Default locations are the
        bottom of the bottom layer and the top of the top layer.

        The block of BF commands begins with an identifying colon label command
        and ends with a /EOF command.  The colon label command is of the form
        :Clab, where Clab is described above.  Interpolation from multiple
        results sets can be performed by looping through the results file in a
        user-defined macro.  Additional blocks can be appended to Fname2 by
        using KPOS and unique colon labels.  A /INPUT command, with the
        appropriate colon label, may be used to read the block of commands.

        If the model has coincident (or very close) nodes, BFINT must be
        applied to each part of the model separately to ensure that the mapping
        of the nodes is correct.  For example, if nodes belonging to two
        adjacent parts linked by springs are coincident, the operation should
        be performed on each part of the model separately.

        -----
        Only sparse matrices can be exported to Postscript files. This option
        plots the matrix profile as a series of dots.

        If you want to create a .SUB file from several matrices, you need to
        set Val3 = WAIT for all matrices but the last, and Val3 = DONE for the
        last one. The export will be effective at the last *EXPORT command.

        or in the Val1 field for .DMIG.) This must be an m x 2 array, where m
        is the size of the matrix. The first column is the node number and the

            INVE - Invert the current set (selected becomes unselected and vice versa).

            STAT - Display the current select status.

        Notes
        -----
        Selects elements based on values of a labeled item and component. For
        example, to select a new set of elements based on element numbers 1
        through 7, use ESEL,S,ELEM,,1,7.  The subset is used when the ALL label
        is entered (or implied) on other commands, such as ELIST,ALL.  Only
        data identified by element number are selected. Selected data are
        internally flagged; no actual removal of data from the database occurs.
        Different element subsets cannot be used for different load steps
        [SOLVE] in a /SOLU sequence.  The subset used in the first load step
        will be used for all subsequent load steps regardless of subsequent
        ESEL specifications.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Elements crossing the named path (see PATH command) will be selected.
        This option is only available in PREP7 and POST1. If no geometry data
        has been mapped to the path (i.e., via PMAP and PDEF commands), the
        path will assume the default mapping option (PMAP,UNIFORM) to map the
        geometry prior to selecting the elements. If an invalid path name is
        given, the ESEL command is ignored (status of selected elements is
        unchanged). If there are no elements crossing the path, the ESEL
        command will return zero elements selected.

        For selections based on non-integer numbers (coordinates, results,
        etc.), items that are within the range VMIN -Toler and VMAX + Toler are
        selected. The default tolerance Toler is based on the relative values
        of VMIN and VMAX as follows:

        If VMIN = VMAX, Toler = 0.005 x VMIN.

        If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, Toler = 1.0E-6.

        If VMAX ≠ VMIN, Toler = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX - VMIN).

        Use the SELTOL command to override this default and specify Toler
        explicitly.

        table
            Table name or array parameter reference for specifying thickness.

        kcn
            Local coordinate system reference number or array interpretation
            pattern for this tabular function evaluation.

        Notes
        -----
         The SECFUNCTION command is associated with the section most recently
        defined via the SECTYPE command.

        A table (TABLE) can define tabular thickness as a function of
        coordinates. Alternatively, you can use an array parameter (indexed by
        node number) that expresses the function to be mapped. (For example,
        func (17) should be the desired shell thickness at node 17.)  To
        specify a table, enclose the table or array name in percent signs (%)
        (SECFUNCTION,%tablename%). Use the *DIM command to define a table.

        The table or array defines the total shell thickness at any point in
        space. In multilayered sections, the total thickness and each layer
        thickness are scaled accordingly.

        The Function Tool is a convenient way to define your thickness tables.
        For more information, see Using the Function Tool in the Basic Analysis
        Guide.

        If you do not specify a local coordinate system (KCN), the program
        interprets TABLE in global XYZ coordinates. (For information about
        local coordinate systems, see the LOCAL command documentation.)

        When KCN = NODE, the program interprets TABLE as an array parameter
        (indexed by node number) that expresses the function to be mapped.

        When KCN = NOD2, the program interprets TABLE as a 2-D array parameter
        (where columns contain node numbers and rows contain the corresponding
        thicknesses) that expresses the function to be mapped.

        Notes
        -----
        Use Option = ANSYS when running an implicit-to-explicit sequential
        solution to initialize the structure to a static solution performed
        earlier by the ANSYS implicit solver. Use Option = DYNA to perform
        dynamic relaxation within the LS-DYNA program. Use Option = OFF to turn
        off previously specified stress initialization or dynamic relaxation.
        You must specify the Option you want; there is no default.

        In LS-DYNA, the dynamic relaxation is performed before the regular
        transient analysis. The convergence process of the dynamic relaxation
        is not written to the ANSYS history file. The ANSYS results files only
        include the converged result of the dynamic relaxation, which is the
        result at time zero in the Jobname.HIS and Jobname.RST files.

        You can restart a dynamic relaxation analysis (EDSTART,2 or EDSTART,3)
        from a previous transient analysis or a previous dynamic relaxation
        analysis. In the restart, you can change or set the convergence
        criteria with the EDDRELAX command. Only the load curves that are
        flagged for dynamic relaxation (PHASE = 1 or 2 on EDLOAD) are applied
        after restarting. If you restart the explicit portion of an implicit-
        to-explicit sequential solution, you do not need to reissue the REXPORT
        command because displacement information contained in the drelax file
        is already included in the LS-DYNA restart file. If the dynamic
        relaxation is activated from a regular transient analysis, LS-DYNA
        continues the output of data to ANSYS results files. This is unlike the
        dynamic relaxation phase at the beginning of the calculation for which
        only the converged solution is written.

        label
            Behavior control key:

            BORD - Controls the functionality of the mouse buttons for dynamic viewing mode only.
                   When Label = BORD, the three values that follow control the
                   functionality of the LEFT, MIDDLE and RIGHT buttons,
                   respectively (see below).

            MSGPOP - Controls which messages from the ANSYS error message subroutine are displayed
                     in a message dialog box.

            REPLOT - Controls whether or not an automatic replot occurs after functions affecting
                     the model are executed.

            ABORT - Controls whether or not ANSYS displays dialog boxes to show the status of an
                    operation in progress and to cancel that operation.

            DYNA - Controls whether the dynamic mode preview is a bounding box or the edge outline
                   of the model.  This label only applies to 2-D display
                   devices (i.e., /SHOW,XII or /SHOW,WIN32).  This "model edge
                   outline" mode is only supported in PowerGraphics
                   [/GRAPHICS,POWER] and is intended for element, line,
                   results, area, or volume displays.

            PICK - Controls how graphical entities are highlighted from within the ANSYS Select
                   menu.

            POWER - Controls whether or not PowerGraphics is active when the GUI is initiated. The
                    ANSYS program default status is PowerGraphics “ON”;  this
                    command is used (placed in the start.ans file) when full
                    graphics is desired on start up.

            DPRO - Controls whether or not the ANSYS input window displays a dynamic prompt. The
                   dynamic prompt shows the correct command syntax for the
                   command, as you are entering it.

            UNDO - Controls whether or not the session editor includes nonessential commands or
                   comments in the file it creates. You can use this option to
                   include comments and other materials in the session editor
                   file.

            LEGE - Controls whether or not the multi-legend is activated when you start the GUI.
                   The multi-legend enables you to specify the location of your
                   legend items in each of the five graphics windows. You can
                   place this option in your start.ans file and have the GUI
                   start with the legend items in a pre-specified location.

            PBAK - Controls whether or not the background shading is activated when you start the
                   GUI. You can place this option in your start.ans file.

            ZPIC - Controls the sorting order for entities that are coincident (directly in front
                   of or behind each other) to a picked spot on your model.
                   When you pick a spot on your model that could indicate two
                   or more entities, a message warns you of this condition, and
                   a list of the coincident entities can be generated. The
                   VALUE term (below) will determine the sort order.

            HPOP - Controls the prioritization of your GUI windows when the contents are ported to
                   a plot or print file (/UI,COPY,SAVE). OpenGL (3D) graphics
                   devices require that the ANSYS Graphics Screen contents be
                   set in front of all overlying windows in order to port them
                   to a printer or a file. This operation can sometimes
                   conflict with /NOERASE settings. See the VALUE term (below)
                   to determine the available control options.

        value
            Values controlling behavior if Label = BORD:

            1 - PAN, controls dynamic translations.

            2 - ZOOM, controls zoom, and dynamic rotation about the view vector.

        Notes

        Specifies the number of rows to be used in array parameter operations.
        The size of the submatrix used is determined from the upper left
        starting array element (defined on the operation command) to the lower
        right array element (defined by the number of rows on this command and
        the number of columns on the *VCOL command).  NINC allows skipping row
        operations for some operation commands.  Skipped rows are included in
        the row count.  The starting row number must be defined on the
        operation command for each parameter read and for the result written.

        The default NROW is calculated from the maximum number of rows of the
        result array (the *DIM row dimension) minus the starting location + 1.
        For example, *DIM,R,,10 and a starting location of R(7) gives a default
        of 4 loops (filling R(7), R(8), R(9), and R(10)).  Repeat operations
        automatically terminate at the last row of the result array.  Existing
        values in the rows and columns of the results matrix remain unchanged
        where not overwritten by the requested input or operation values.

        The stride (NINC) allows operations to be performed at regular
        intervals.  It has no effect on the total number of row operations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        xloc, yloc, zloc
            Global Cartesian X, Y, and Z coordinates of the acceleration
            coordinate system origin.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the origin location of the acceleration coordinate system
        with respect to the global Cartesian system.  The axes of this
        acceleration coordinate system are parallel to the global Cartesian
        axes.

        A structure may be rotating about the global Cartesian origin [OMEGA,
        DOMEGA], which may in turn be rotating about another point (the origin
        of the acceleration coordinate system), introducing Coriolis effects.
        The location of this point (relative to the global Cartesian origin) is
        specified with this CGLOC command.  For example, if Y is vertical and
        the global system origin is at the surface of the earth while the
        acceleration system origin is at the center of the earth, YLOC should
        be -4000 miles (or equivalent) if the rotational effects of the earth
        are to be included.  The rotational velocity of the global Cartesian
        system about this point is specified with the CGOMGA command, and the
        rotational acceleration is specified with the DCGOMG command.

        The rotational velocities and accelerations are mainly intended to
        include mass effects in a static (ANTYPE,STATIC) analysis.  If used in
        dynamic analyses, no coupling exists between the user input terms and
        the time history response of the structure.  See Acceleration Effect in
        the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for details.  Related commands are

        Notes

        signif
            Combine only those modes whose significance level exceeds theSIGNIF
            threshold.  For PSD response (SPOPT,PSD), the significance level is
            defined as the modal covariance matrix term, divided by the maximum

            less than SIGNIF is considered insignificant and is not contributed
            to the mode combinations.  The higher the SIGNIF threshold, the
            fewer the number of terms used. SIGNIF defaults to 0.0001.  If
            SIGNIF is specified as 0.0, it is taken as 0.0.

        comode
            First COMODE number of modes to be actually combined.  COMODE must
            always be less than or equal to NMODE (input quantity NMODE on the
            SPOPT command).  COMODE defaults to NMODE.  COMODE performs a
            second level of control for the first sequential COMODE number of

        elem
            Identifies the tetrahedral elements to be improved.  Valid values
            are ALL and P.  If ELEM = ALL (default), improve all selected

        chgbnd
            Specifies whether to allow boundary modification.  Boundary
            modification includes such things as changes in the connectivity of
            the element faces on the boundary and the addition of boundary
            nodes.  (Also see the Notes section below for important usage
            information for CHGBND.)

            0 - Do not allow boundary modification.

        implevel
            Identifies the level of improvement to be performed on the
            elements.  (Improvement occurs primarily through the use of face
            swapping and node smoothing techniques.)

            0 - Perform the least amount of swapping/smoothing.

            1 - Perform an intermediate amount of swapping/smoothing.

            2 - Perform the greatest amount of swapping/smoothing.

            3 - Perform the greatest amount of swapping/smoothing, plus additional improvement
                techniques (default).

        Notes
        -----
        The TIMP command enables you to improve a given tetrahedral mesh by
        reducing the number of poorly-shaped tetrahedral elements (in
        particular, the number of sliver tetrahedral elements)--as well as the
        overall number of elements--in the mesh.  It also improves the overall
        quality of the mesh.

        TIMP is particularly useful for an imported tetrahedral mesh for which
        no geometry information is attached.

        Regardless of the value of the CHGBND argument, boundary mid-nodes can
        be moved.

        When loads or constraints have been placed on boundary nodes or mid-
        nodes, and boundary mid-nodes are later moved, ANSYS issues a warning
        message to let you know that it will not update the loads or
        constraints.

        No boundary modification is performed if shell or beam elements are
        present in the mesh, even when CHGBND = 1.

        APDL Command: PERTURB

        Sets linear perturbation analysis options.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type
            Type of linear perturbation analysis to be performed:

            STATIC - Perform a linear perturbation static analysis.

            MODAL - Perform a linear perturbation modal analysis.

            BUCKLE - Perform a linear perturbation eigenvalue buckling analysis.

            HARMONIC - Perform a linear perturbation full harmonic analysis.

            SUBSTR - Perform a linear perturbation substructure generation pass.

            OFF - Do not perform a linear perturbation analysis (default).

        matkey
            Key for specifying how the linear perturbation analysis uses
            material properties, valid for all structural elements except
            contact elements. For more information, see Linear Perturbation
            Analysis in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference.

            AUTO - The program selects the material properties for the linear perturbation
                   analysis automatically (default). The materials are handled
                   in the following way:

            For pure linear elastic materials used in the base analysis, the same properties are used in the linear perturbation analysis. - For hyperelastic materials used in the base analysis, the material properties
                              are assumed to be linear elastic in the linear
                              perturbation analysis. The material property data
                              (or material Jacobian) is obtained based on the
                              tangent of the hyperelastic material's
                              constitutive law at the point where restart
                              occurs.

            For any nonlinear materials other than hyperelastic materials used in the base analysis, the material properties are assumed to be linear elastic in the linear perturbation analysis. The material data is the same as the linear portion of the nonlinear materials (that is, the parts defined by MP commands). - For COMBIN39, the stiffness is that of the first segment of the force-
                              deflection curve.

            TANGENT - Use the tangent (material Jacobian) on the material constitutive curve as the
                      material property. The material property remains linear
                      in the linear perturbation analysis and is obtained at
                      the point of the base analysis where restart occurs. The
                      materials are handled in the following way:

            For pure linear elastic materials used in the base analysis, the same properties are used in the linear perturbation analysis. Because the material constitutive curve is linear, the tangent is the same as the base analysis.  - For hyperelastic materials used in the base analysis, the program uses the same
                              tangent as that used for MatKey = AUTO, and the
                              results are therefore identical.

            For any nonlinear materials other than hyperelastic materials used in the base analysis, the material properties are obtained via the material tangent on the material constitutive curve at the restart point of the base analysis.  - The materials and properties typically differ from Matkey = AUTO, but it is
                              possible the results could be identical or very
                              similar if a.) the material is elasto-plastic
                              rate-independent and is unloading (or has neutral
                              loading) at the restart point, or b.) the
                              material is rate-dependent, depending on the
                              material properties and loading conditions.

            For COMBIN39, the stiffness is equal to the tangent of the current segment of the force-deflection curve. - In a modal restart solution that follows a linear perturbation modal analysis,
                              the TANGENT option is overridden by the AUTO
                              option and linear material properties are used
                              for stress calculations in the modal restart. See
                              the discussion in the Notes for more information.

        contkey
            Key that controls contact status for the linear perturbation
            analysis. This key controls all contact elements (TARGE169,
            TARGE170, and CONTA171 through CONTA178) globally for all contact
            pairs. Alternatively, contact status can be controlled locally per
            contact pair by using the CNKMOD command. Note that the contact
            status from the base analysis solution is always adjusted by the
            local contact controls specified by CNKMOD first and then modified
            by the global sticking or bonded control (ContKey = STICKING or
            BONDED). The tables in the Notes section show how the contact
            status is adjusted by CNKMOD and/or the ContKey setting.

            CURRENT - Use the current contact status from the restart snapshot (default). If the
                      previous run is nonlinear, then the nonlinear contact
                      status at the point of restart is frozen and used
                      throughout the linear perturbation analysis.

            STICKING - For frictional contact pairs (MU > 0), use sticking contact (e.g., MU*KN for
                       tangential contact stiffness)  everywhere the contact
                       state is closed (i.e., status is sticking or sliding).
                       This option only applies to contact pairs that are in
                       contact and have a frictional coefficient MU greater
                       than zero. Contact pairs without friction (MU = 0) and
                       in a sliding state remain free to slide in the linear
                       perturbation analysis.

            BONDED - Any contact pairs that are in the closed (sticking or sliding) state are moved
                     to bonded (for example, KN for both normal and tangential
                     contact stiffness). Contact pairs that have a status of
                     far-field or near-field remain open.

        loadcontrol
            Key that controls how the load vector of {Fperturbed} is
            calculated. This control is provided for convenience of load
            generation for linear perturbation analysis. In general, a new set
            of loads is required for a linear perturbation analysis. This key
            controls all mechanical loads; it does not affect non-mechanical
            loads. Non-mechanical loads (including thermal loads) are always
            kept (i.e., not deleted).

            ALLKEEP - Keep all the boundary conditions (loads and constraints) from the end of the
                      load step of the current restart point. This option is
                      convenient for further load application and is useful for
                      a linear perturbation analysis restarted from a previous
                      linear analysis. For this option, {Fend} is the total
                      load vector at the end of the load step at the restart
                      point.

            INERKEEP - Delete all loads and constraints from the restart step, except for displacement
                       constraints and inertia loads (default). All
                       displacement constraints and inertia loads are kept for
                       convenience when performing the linear perturbation
                       analysis. Note that nonzero and tabular displacement
                       constraints can be considered as external loads;
                       however, they are not deleted when using this option.

            PARKEEP - Delete all loads and constraints from the restart step, except for displacement
                      constraints. All displacement constraints are kept for
                      convenience when performing the linear perturbation
                      analysis. Note that nonzero and tabular displacement
                      constraints can be considered as external loads; however,
                      they are not deleted when using this option.

            DZEROKEEP - Behaves the same as the PARKEEP option, except that all nonzero displacement
                        constraints are set to zero upon the onset of linear
                        perturbation.

            NOKEEP - Delete all the loads and constraints, including all displacement constraints.
                     For this option, {Fend} is zero unless non-mechanical
                     loads (e.g., thermal loads) are present.

        Notes
        -----
        This command controls options relating to linear perturbation analyses.
        It must be issued in the first phase of a linear perturbation analysis.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        A linear perturbation analysis consists of two phases (two SOLVE
        commands). The first phase is a restart from a base analysis. This base
        analysis must be a linear or nonlinear static analysis or full
        transient analysis. The first phase starts with the
        ANTYPE,,RESTART,,,PERTURB command and ends with the SOLVE,ELFORM
        command. The purpose of the first phase is to re-establish a snapshot
        of the stiffness matrices at the specified restart point. The second
        phase, ending with the second SOLVE command, is for the actual linear
        perturbation analysi   s   .   /   p   >   p   >   T   h   e       t

            Relationship key:

                      Allows elements and nodes generated with the mesh
                      commands to be modified directly (EMODIF, NMODIF, EDELE,

                      etc.

            CHECK - Reactivates future checking of the solid model.

            DETACH - Releases all associativity between the current solid model and finite element
                     model.  ANSYS deletes any element attributes that were
                     assigned to the affected solid model entities through

        ----------
        vect1
            Name of the first vector that contains the noisy data set (i.e.,
            independent variable). You must create and fill this vector before
            issuing SMOOTH.

        vect2
            Name of the second vector that contains the dependent set of data.
            Must be the same length as the first vector. You must create and
            fill this vector before issuing SMOOTH.

        datap
            Number of data points to be fitted, starting from the beginning of
            the vector. If left blank, the entire vector will be fitted. The
            maximum number of data points is 100,000 (or greater, depending on
            the memory of the computer).

        fitpt
            Order of the fitting curve that will be used as a smooth
            representation of the data. This number should be less than or
            equal to the number of the data points. Default (blank) is one-half
            the number of data points. Maximum number of smoothed data fitting
            order is the number of data points up to 50.  Depending on this
            number, the smoothed curve will be one of the following:

            1 - Curve is the absolute average of all of the data points.

            2 - Curve is the least square average of all of the data points.

            3 or more - Curve is a polynomial of the order (n-1), where n is the number of data fitting
                        order points.

        vect3
            Name of the vector that contains the smoothed data of the
            independent variable. This vector should have a length equal to or
            greater than the number of smoothed data points. In batch (command)
            mode, you must create this vector before issuing the SMOOTH
            command. In interactive mode, the GUI automatically creates this
            vector (if it does not exist). If you do not specify a vector name,
            the GUI will name the vector smth_ind.

        vect4
            Name of the vector that contains the smoothed data of the dependent
            variable.  This vector must be the same length as Vect3.  In batch
            (command) mode, you must create this vector before issuing the

            this vector (if it does not exist). If you do not specify a vector
            name, the GUI will name the vector smth_dep.

        disp
            Specifies how you want to display data. No default; you must
            specify an option.

            1 - Unsmoothed data only

            2 - Smoothed data only

            3 - Both smoothed and unsmoothed data

        Notes
        -----
        You can control the attributes of the graph using standard ANSYS
        controls (/GRID, /GTHK, /COLOR, etc.). If working interactively, these
        controls appear in this dialog box for convenience, as well as in their
        standard dialog boxes. You must always create Vect1 and Vect2 (using
        *DIM) and fill these vectors before smoothing the data. If you're
        working interactively, ANSYS automatically creates Vect3 and Vect4, but
        if you're working in batch (command) mode, you must create Vect3 and
        Vect4 (using *DIM) before issuing SMOOTH.  Vect3 and Vect4 are then
        filled automatically by ANSYS.  In addition, ANSYS creates an
        additional TABLE type array that contains the smoothed array and the
        unsmoothed data to allow for plotting later with *VPLOT.  Column 1 in
        this table corresponds to Vect1, column 2 to Vect2, and column 3 to
        Vect4.  This array is named Vect3_SMOOTH, up to a limit of 32

            OFF - Turn off feature.

            Note that the number of requested superelements may not be the same

            details).

        mdof
            Specifies whether to use the master DOF defined by the user.

            YES - Use master DOF defined by the user with the M command.

            NO - Use the master DOF defined by the automatic generation process. Be aware that
                 this option can generate a large number of master DOFs (see
                 "Notes"  for more details).

        stopstage
            Specifies when to stop the automatic superelement generation
            process.

            PREVIEW - Preview the superelements only; stop after creating the domains which will
                      become the superelements, and after creating master DOF
                      on the interfaces between each domain.

            GEN - Create (generate) the superelements.

        Notes
        -----
        This command can be used to quickly generate a set of superelements.
        Each superelement is created in a separate file (jobnameXXX.sub, where
        XXX is a positive number from 1 to 999).

        Due to the heuristics in the automatic domain decomposer, which is used
        to define the domains that will become superelements, the number of
        defined superelements may exceed the number of requested superelements.
        Use the mDof and stopStage options to determine exactly how many
        superelements will be created, the interfaces between each
        superelement, and where master DOF will be defined. With the
        /PNUM,DOMAIN command, you can graphically (visually) preview the
        elements in each superelement.  Then, if required, you can add
        additional master DOF to (or remove from) the boundaries of the
        superelements. Use the SEGEN command again with stopStage = GEN to
        actually create the superelements.

        ANSYS automatically defines master DOF at each of the following: all
        interface DOF between superelements, all DOF attached to contact
        elements (TARGE169 to CONTA177), and all DOF associated with nodes
        having a point load defined.  Note that for regular superelements, all
        interface DOFs must be defined as master DOFs for the correct solution
        to be obtained. However, for CMS superelements, some of the interface
        DOFs can be removed without a significant loss of accuracy.

        For the case when mDof = YES, you should select the preview option
        first (stopStage = PREVIEW) to verify exactly how many superelements
        will be created and where the superelement boundaries are located.  If
        more superelements will be created than were requested, you should
        define master DOF on the interface(s) between all superelements.

        This command is valid only for substructuring analyses (ANTYPE,SUBSTR).
        Use SEOPT to specify any options for all of the superelements (e.g.,
        which matrices to reduce), and possibly CMSOPT for any CMS
        substructuring analysis.  Note that the created superelements will
        follow the current /FILNAME instead of SENAME from SEOPT.  Also, only
        one load vector will be written to each .SUB file.  Multiple load steps
        are not supported with the automatic superelement generation process.

        During the actual creation of the superelements, the output is
        redirected to jobname.autoTemp.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows repeated nodal body force loads to be replaced, added, or
        ignored.  Nodal body loads are applied with the BF command.  Issue the
        BFLIST command to list the nodal body loads.  The operations occur when
        the next body loads are defined.  For example, issuing the BF command
        with a temperature of 250 after a previous BF command with a
        temperature of 200 causes the new value of the temperature to be 450
        with the add operation, 250 with the replace operation, or 200 with the
        ignore operation.  A scale factor is also available to multiply the
        next value before the add or replace operation.  A scale factor of 2.0
        with the previous "add" example results in a temperature of 700.  The
        scale factor is applied even if no previous values exist.  Issue

        ----------
        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including
            directory). If you do not specify the LIB option, the default
            directory is the current working directory. If you specify the LIB
            option, the default is the following search path: the current
            working directory, the user's home directory, MPLIB_DIR (as
            specified by the /MPLIB,READ,PATH command) and /ansys_dir/matlib
            (as defined by installation). If you use the default for your
            directory, you can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        lib
            Reads material library files previously written with the MPWRITE
            command.  (See the description of the LIB option for the MPWRITE
            command.)  The only allowed value for LIB is LIB.

        Notes
        -----
        Material properties written to a file without the LIB option do not
        support nonlinear properties.  Also, properties written to a file
        without the LIB option are restored in the same material number as
        originally defined.  To avoid errors, use MPREAD with the LIB option
        only when reading files written using MPWRITE with the LIB option.

        If you omit the LIB option for MPREAD, this command supports only
        linear properties.

        Material numbers are hardcoded.  If you write a material file without
        specifying the LIB option, then read that file in using the MPREAD
        command with the LIB option, the ANSYS program will not write the file
        to a new material number.  Instead, it will write the file to the "old"
        material number (the number specified on the MPWRITE command that
        created the file.)

        APDL Command: /PSF

        Parameters

        item, comp
            Labels identifying the surface load to be shown; see
            Table 227: /PSF - Valid Item and Component Labels.

        key
            Key to turn surface load symbols on or off:

            0 - Off (default).

            1 - On, shown as face outlines.  Line surface loads (SFL) on solid model plots are
                shown as arrows.

            2 - On, shown as arrows.

            3 - On, shown as color filled surfaces.  Line and area surface loads (SFL and SFA)
                on solid model plots are shown as arrows.

        kshell
            Visibility key for shell elements.

            0 - Off (default),  surface load symbols are displayed only on visible load faces.

            1 - On, surface load symbols are displayed even if load face is not visible.

        color
            Visibility key for contour legend.

            ON - The symbols (arrows or face outlines) will show up in color with the legend
                 showing the corresponding color labels (default).

            OFF - The contour legend will not be displayed. The symbols (arrows or face outlines)
                  will show up in grey. The size of the arrows will be
                  proportional to the applied load.

        Notes
        -----
        The /PSF command determines whether and how to show surface loads on
        subsequent model displays.

        If surface loads are applied to solid model entities, only solid model
        plots show the load symbols; node and element plots do not show them
        unless the loads are transferred (SFTRAN or SBCTRAN).  Similarly, solid
        model plots do not show the load symbols if surface loads are applied
        to nodes and elements.  For node and element plots of shell element
        models, the surface load symbols are shown only if the load face is
        visible from the current viewing direction.

        The effects of the /PSF command are not cumulative (that is, the
        command does not modify an existing setting from a previously issued
        /PSF command).  Only the setting specified via the most recent /PSF
        command applies.

        If you issue a postprocessing (POST1) plot command that produces result
        contours (such as PLNSOL), the /PSF command has no effect. This
        behavior prevents conflicting contours in the graphics window.

        When using the radiosity method (Item = RDSF and Comp = ENCL) with Key
        = 2, the radiation arrows point outward from any element face. When
        using SURF154 with KEYOPT(2) = 1, set the Item to PRES and leave the
        Component Label blank.

        /PSF,STAT displays current /PSF settings, and /PSF,DEFA resets them
        back to default.

        Other useful commands are /PNUM,SVAL,1 to show the values of the
        surface loads, /VSCALE to change arrow lengths, and /PBC and /PBF to
        activate other load symbols.

        For beam elements, only the colors representing shear (GREEN) and
        normal (RED) pressures are displayed for the arrows. The color of these
        arrows does not correspond to the magnitudes in the contour legend. The
        length of these arrows does, however, correlate to the relative
        magnitude of the pressures.

        For elements SURF159, SOLID272, SOLID273, PIPE288 and PIPE289, the /PSF
        command is not available when displaying elements with shapes
        determined from the real constants or section definition (/ESHAPE). For
        PIPE288 and PIPE289, only external loads applied via the SFBEAM command
        are displayed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rlab
            Result set label. Identifies the result set to be used for
            postprocessing. A result set label can be the solution set label
            you defined in a PDEXE command (if you are directly postprocessing
            Monte Carlo Simulation results), or the response surface set label
            defined in an RSFIT command (for Response Surface Analyses).

        matrix
            Keyword for the type of correlation coefficient matrix.

            IO - Matrix of correlation coefficients between random input variables and output
                 parameters.

            II - Matrix of correlation coefficients between random input variables and other
                 random input variables

            OO - Matrix of correlation coefficients between random output parameters and other
                 random output parameters.

            S - Correlation coefficient between a single random parameter (input or output) and
                another random parameter (input or output). The probabilistic
                design parameters must be specified in Name1 and Name2 for this
                option.

        name1, name2
            Parameter names. The parameters must have been previously defined
            as a random input variable or a random output parameter with the
            PDVAR command. These parameters are used for Matrix = S only and
            are ignored for the other Matrix keywords.

        corr
            Keyword for the type of correlation coefficients to be used for the
            output.

            RANK - Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (default).

            LIN - Pearson linear correlation coefficient.

        slevel
            Significance level. The value for the significance level must be
            between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.025 (2.5%).

        popt
            Specifies whether the probabilities should be printed with the
            correlation coefficients.

            0 - Print only the correlation coefficients.

            1 - Print both the correlation coefficients and the probabilities (default).

        Notes
        -----
        Prints the correlation coefficient matrix.

        If Rlab is left blank, then the result set label is inherited from the
        last PDEXE command (Slab), RSFIT command (RSlab), or the most recently
        used PDS postprocessing command where a result set label was explicitly
        specified.

        For all correlation coefficients the probabilistic design tool
        evaluates the probability that the correlation coefficient can be
        neglected. The evaluation of this probability is based on statistical
        test theory. The larger this probability is the likelier it is that the
        correlation coefficient does not really reflect an observable
        statistical interdependence between the parameters involved. If this
        probability exceeds the significance level as specified by the SLEVEL
        parameter, the correlation coefficient should be regarded as negligible
        or insignificant. The higher the significance level SLEVEL, the more
        correlation coefficients are considered significant. Using the Popt
        parameter you can also get a list of the probabilities and review them
        as to how far they exceed the significance level or how far they stay
        below it.

        The PDCMAT command cannot be used to postprocess the results in a

        ESYS] that was active during meshing (and will be reset to zero if the
        mesh is cleared).  A "-1" in the "nodes" column indicates that the
        volume has been meshed but there are no interior nodes.  The volume
        size is listed only if a VSUM command has been performed on the volume.

        Parameters
        ----------
        analopt
            Analysis option

            FLUID - Particle trace in fluid flow (default)

            ELEC - Particle trace in electric field

            MAGN - Particle trace in magnetic field

            EMAG - Particle trace in presence of both electric and magnetic fields

        item
            Label identifying the item to be contoured.  Valid item labels are
            shown in Table 222: PLTRAC - Valid Item and Component Labels
            below.  Some items also require a component label.  If Item is
            blank, display only the path trajectory.

        comp
            Component of the item (if required).  Valid component labels are
            shown in Table 222: PLTRAC - Valid Item and Component Labels below.

        trpnum
            Trace point number for storing trajectory data for use with PATH
            logic. Defaults to 0 (no trajectory path data is stored for further
            processing with PATH logic).

        name
            Name of prefix of array variable. Defaults to TRAC. NamePOIN stores
            trajectory path points for trace point number TRPNum. If Analopt =
            ELEC, MAGN, or EMAG, two additional array parameters, NameDATA and
            NameLABL, store trajectory path data and labels for the same
            TRPNum.

        mxloop
            Maximum number of loops traced by a particle.  Defaults to 25 for
            Opt = FLUID; otherwise, defaults to 1000.

        toler
            Length tolerance used for particle trajectory geometry calculation.
            Valid only for Analopt = ELEC, MAGN, or EMAG.  If particle trace
            appears to terminate inside an element, adjusting the length
            tolerance may be necessary.  Defaults to 1.0 x 10-8.

        option
            Flow trace option:

            0 - Use the undeformed mesh for computing the flow trace.

            1 - Use the deformed mesh for computing the flow trace.

        escl
            Electric field scale factor. Setting this scale factor affects only
            the tracing, not the field solution results. A negative factor
            corresponds to the opposite vector direction. Valid only for
            Analopt = ELEC or EMAG. Defaults to 1.

        mscl
            Magnetic field scale factor. Setting this scale factor affects only
            the tracing, not the field solution results. A negative factor
            corresponds to the opposite vector direction. Valid only for
            Analopt = MAGN or EMAG. Defaults to 1.

        Notes
        -----
        For a specified item, the variation of the item is displayed along the
        particle trace as a color-contoured ribbon.  The TRPOIN command must be
        used to define a point on the trajectory path.  Multiple traces may be
        displayed simultaneously by defining multiple trace points.  Issue the
        TRPLIS command to list the current tracing points.  Issue the TRPDEL
        command to delete tracing points defined earlier.   Use the PAPUT
        command with the POIN option to retrieve the particle trajectory points
        as path points.

        The model must be 3-D for the ELEC, MAGN, and EMAG analysis options.

        Three array parameters are created at the time of the particle trace:
        TRACPOIN, TRACDATA and TRACLABL. These array parameters can be used to
        put the particle velocity and the elapsed time into path form.   The
        procedure to put the arrays into a path named PATHNAME is as follows:

        Not used if Analopt = FLUID.  If working in the GUI, use the "All
        information" option to retrieve information from all three arrays at
        once.

        If OPTION is set to 1, the deformed mesh is based on the displacement
        degrees of freedom UX, UY, and UZ, which must be available in the load
        step.

        omegx, omegy, omegz
            Rotational velocity of the structure about the global Cartesian X,
            Y, and Z axes.

        Notes
        -----
        This command specifies the rotational velocity of the structure about
        each of the global Cartesian axes (right-hand rule).  Rotational
        velocities may be defined in these analysis types:

        Static (ANTYPE,STATIC)

        Harmonic (ANTYPE,HARMIC) -- Full or mode-superposition

        Transient (ANTYPE,TRANS)  -- Full or mode-superposition

        Substructuring (ANTYPE,SUBSTR)

        Modal (ANTYPE,MODAL)

        The OMEGA command supports tabular boundary conditions (%TABNAME_X%,
        %TABNAME_Y%, and %TABNAME_Z%) for OMEGA_X, OMEGA_Y, and OMEGA_Z input
        values (*DIM) for full transient and harmonic analyses.

        Rotational velocities are combined with the element mass matrices to
        form a body force load vector term.  Units are radians/time.  Related
        commands are ACEL, CGLOC, CGOMGA, DCGOMG, and DOMEGA.

        See Analysis Tools in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference for more
        information.

        If you have applied the Coriolis effect (CORIOLIS) using a stationary
        reference frame, the OMEGA command takes the gyroscopic damping matrix
        into account for the elements listed in the “Stationary Reference
        Frame” heading in the notes section of the CORIOLIS command. The
        element axis must pass through the global Cartesian origin. ANSYS
        verifies that the rotation vector axis is parallel to the axis of the
        element; if not, the gyroscopic effect is not applied. After issuing
        the OMEGA command when the Coriolis or gyroscopic effect is present, a
        subsequently issued CMOMEGA command has no effect.

        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you must apply
        the load in the modal portion of the analysis. Mechanical APDL
        calculates a load vector and writes it to the MODE file, which you can
        apply via the LVSCALE command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        par
            An alphanumeric name used to identify the scalar parameter.  See
            *SET for name restrictions.

        query
            Text string to be displayed on the next line as the query (32
            characters maximum).  Characters having special meaning (such as $
            ! ,) should not be included.

        dval
            Default value assigned to the parameter if the user issues a blank
            response.  May be a number or character string (up to 8 characters
            enclosed in single quotes).  If a default is not assigned, a blank
            response will delete the parameter.

        Notes
        -----
        Intended primarily for use in macros, the command prints the query
        (after the word ENTER) on the next line and waits for a response.  The
        response is read from the keyboard, except in batch mode [/BATCH], when
        the response(s) must be the next-read input line(s).  The response may
        be a number, a character string (up to 8 characters enclosed in single
        quotes), a parameter (numeric or character) or an expression that
        evaluates to a number.  The scalar parameter is then set to the
        response value.  For example,  *ASK,NN,PARAMETER NN  will set NN to the
        value entered on the next line (after the prompt ENTER PARAMETER NN).

        The *ASK command is not written to File.LOG,  but the responses are
        written there as follows:  If *ASK is contained in a macro, the
        response(s) (only) is written to File.LOG on the line(s) following the
        macro name.   If not contained in a macro, the response is written to
        File.LOG as a parameter assignment (i.e., Par = "user-response").

        If used within a do-loop that is executed interactively, *ASK should be
        contained in a macro.  If not contained in a macro, *ASK will still
        query the user as intended, but the resulting log file will not
        reproduce the effects of the original run.

        This command is valid in any processor.

        Parameters

            The first guiding line forming the skinned area.  If NL1 = P,
            graphical picking is enabled and all remaining arguments are
            ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A component name may also be

            (see "Changing the ASKIN Algorithm" below).

        nl2, nl3, nl4, . . . , nl9
            The additional guiding lines for the skinned area (up to 9 total
            lines, including NL1, if using keyboard entry).  If negative (and
            NL1 is negative), the line beginning and end will be temporarily
            interchanged for the skinning operation (see "Changing the ASKIN
            Algorithm" below).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates an area by "skinning" a surface through specified guiding
        lines.  The lines act as a set of "ribs" over which a surface is
        "stretched."  Two opposite edges of the area are framed by the first
        (NL1) and last (NLn) guiding lines specified.  The other two edges of
        the area are framed by splines-fit lines which the program
        automatically generates through the ends of all guiding lines.  The
        interior of the area is shaped by the interior guiding lines.  Once the
        area has been created, only the four edge lines will be attached to it.
        In rare cases, it may be necessary to change the default algorithm used
        by the ASKIN command (see "Changing the ASKIN Algorithm" below).

        When skinning from one guiding line to the next, the program can create
        the transition area in one of two ways:  one more spiraled and one less
        spiraled ("flatter").  By default, the program attempts to produce the
        flatter transition, instead of the more spiraled transition.  This
        algorithm can be changed by inputting NL1 as a negative number, in
        which case the program connects all the keypoints at the line
        "beginnings" (/PSYMB,LDIR command) as one edge of the area, and all the
        line "ends" as the opposite edge, irrespective of the amount of
        spiraling produced in each transition area.

        To further control the geometry of the area (if NL1 is negative), the
        beginning and end of any specified line (other than NL1) can be
        temporarily interchanged (for the skinning operation only) by inputting
        that line number as negative.  See Solid Modeling in the Modeling and
        Meshing Guide for an illustration.

            Source mode number. There is no default for this field; you must
            enter an integer greater than zero.

        tmode
            Target mode. Defaults to SMODE.

        dmpname
            Array parameter name containing the damping results. Defaults to
            d_damp.

        freqb
            Beginning frequency range (real number greater than zero) or 'EIG'
            at eigenfrequency of source mode. 'EIG' is valid only if SMODE =
            TMODE. Note that EIG must be enclosed in single quotes when this
            command is used on the command line or in an input file. There is
            no default for this field; you must enter a value.

        freqe
            End of frequency range. Must be blank for Freqb = EIG. Default is
            Freqb.

            Number of substeps. Defaults to 1.

        Notes
        -----
        DMPEXT invokes an ANSYS macro that uses modal projection techniques to
        compute the damping force by the modal velocity of the source mode onto
        the target mode. From the damping force, damping parameters are
        extracted. DMPEXT creates an array parameter Dmpname, with the
        following entries in each row:

        response frequency

        modal damping coefficient

        modal squeeze stiffness coefficient

        damping ratio

        squeeze-to-structural stiffness ratio

        The macro requires the modal displacements from the file Jobname.EFL
        obtained from the RMFLVEC command. In addition, a node component FLUN
        must exist from all FLUID136 nodes. The computed damping ratio may be
        used to specify constant or modal damping by means of the DMPRAT or
        MDAMP commands. For Rayleigh damping, use the ABEXTRACT command to
        compute ALPHAD and BETAD damping parameters. See Thin Film Analysis for
        more information on thin film analyses.

        The macro uses the LSSOLVE command to perform two load steps for each
        frequency.  The first load case contains the solution of the source
        mode excitation and can be used for further postprocessing. Solid model
        boundary conditions are deleted from the model.  In addition,
        prescribed nodal boundary conditions are applied to the model.  You
        should carefully check the boundary conditions of your model prior to
        executing a subsequent analysis.

        the centroid x-location of element 5 and stores the result in the first
        location of A.  Retrieving continues with element 6, 7, 8, etc.,
        regardless of whether the element exists or is selected, until
        successive array locations are filled.  Use *VLEN or *VMASK to skip
        locations. Absolute values and scale factors may be applied to the

        See the *VOPER command for general details.  Results can be put back
        into an analysis by writing a file of the desired input commands with
        the *VWRITE command.  See also the *VPUT command.

        Both *GET and *VGET retrieve information from the active data stored in

                              use this option once to reverse the normals for
                              all selected elements.

        shape
            Used to specify the element shape for target element TARGE170
            (Shape = LINE or POINT) or TARGE169 elements (Shape = POINT).

            (blank) - The target element takes the same shape as the external surface of the
                      underlying element (default).

            LINE - Generates LINE or PARA (parabolic) segments on exterior of selected 3-D
                   elements.

            POINT - Generates POINT segments on selected nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        The ESURF command generates elements of the currently active element
        type overlaid on the free faces of existing elements. For example,
        surface elements (such as SURF151, SURF152, SURF153, SURF154, or
        SURF159) can be generated over solid elements (such as PLANE55,
        SOLID70, PLANE182, SOLID185, or SOLID272, respectively).

        Element faces are determined from the selected node set (NSEL) and the
        load faces for that element type. The operation is similar to that used
        for generating element loads from selected nodes via the SF,ALL
        command, except that elements (instead of loads) are generated. All
        nodes on the face must be selected for the face to be used. For shell
        elements, only face one of the element is available. If nodes are
        shared by adjacent selected element faces, the faces are not free and
        no element is generated.

        Elements created by ESURF are oriented such that their surface load
        directions are consistent with those of the underlying elements.
        Carefully check generated elements and their orientations.

        Generated elements use the existing nodes and the active MAT, TYPE,
        REAL, and ESYS attributes. The exception is when Tlab = REVERSE. The
        reversed target and contact elements have the same attributes as the
        original elements. If the underlying elements are solid elements, Tlab
        = TOP or BOTTOM has no effect.

        When the command generates a target element, the shape is by default
        the same as that of the underlying element. Issue  ESURF,,,LINE or
        ESURF,,,POINT to generate LINE, PARA, and POINT segments.

        The ESURF command can also generate the 2-D or 3-D node-to-surface
        element CONTA175, based on the selected node components of the
        underlying solid elements. When used to generate CONTA175 elements, all
        ESURF arguments are ignored. (If CONTA175 is the active element type,
        the path Main Menu> Preprocessor> Modeling> Create> Elements> Node-to-
        Surf uses ESURF to generate elements.)

        To generate SURF151 or SURF152 elements that have two extra nodes from
        FLUID116 elements, KEYOPT(5) for SURF151 or SURF152 is first set to 0
        and ESURF is issued. Then KEYOPT(5) for SURF151 or SURF152 is set to 2
        and MSTOLE is issued. For more information, see Using the Surface
        Effect Elements in the Thermal Analysis Guide.

        For hydrostatic fluid elements HSFLD241 and HSFLD242, the ESURF command
        generates triangular (2-D) or pyramid-shaped (3-D) elements with bases
        that are overlaid on the faces of selected 2-D or 3-D solid or shell
        elements. The single vertex for all generated elements is at the
        pressure node specified as XNODE. The generated elements fill the
        volume enclosed by the solid or shell elements. The nodes on the
        overlaid faces have translational degrees of freedom, while the
        pressure node shared by all generated elements has a single hydrostatic
        pressure degree of freedom, HDSP (see HSFLD241 and HSFLD242 for more
        information about the pressure node).

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Label identifying the load option to be performed.

            ADD - Define a load (default). If Option = ADD, Cname must be a valid node or element
                  component name (or PART number). You must also specify a load
                  curve using Par1 and Par2 (previously defined array
                  parameters) or LCID (a previously defined load curve).

            DELE - Delete specified load. If Lab and Cname are blank, all loads are deleted. Par1,
                   Par2, PHASE, and LCID are ignored for this option.

            LIST - List specified load. If Lab and Cname are blank, all loads are listed. Par1,
                   Par2, PHASE, and LCID are ignored for this option.

        lab
            Valid load labels for loads applied to nodes:

            FX, FY, FZ - Forces.

            MX, MY, MZ - Moments.

            UX, UY, UZ - Displacements.

            ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ - Rotations.

            VX, VY, VZ - Velocities.

            ACLX, ACLY, ACLZ - Base accelerations.

            TEMP - Temperature.

        key
            When Lab = PRESS, KEY = Load key (face number) associated with a
            surface pressure load. Load keys (1,2,3, etc.) are listed under
            "Surface Loads" in the input data tables for each element type in
            the Element Reference.

        cname
            Name of existing component [CM] or PART number [EDPART] to which
            this load is to be applied.  For all load labels except the
            pressure load (Lab = PRESS) and the rigid body loads (Lab = RBxx),
            the component must consist of nodes. For pressure loads, the
            component must consist of elements. For rigid body loads, a part
            number must be input instead of a component name. The part number
            must correspond to a set of elements that has been identified as a
            rigid body [EDMP,RIGID,MAT].

        par1
            Name of user-defined array parameter that contains the time values
            of the load.

        par2
            Name of user-defined array parameter that contains the "data"
            values of the load corresponding to the time values in Par1.

        phase
            Phase of the analysis in which the load curve is to be used.

            0 - Curve is used in transient analysis only (default).

            1 - Curve is used in stress initialization or dynamic relaxation only.

            2 - Curve is used in both stress initialization (or dynamic relaxation) and
                transient analysis.

        lcid
            Data curve ID number representing the load curve to be applied. The
            load curve must have been previously defined using the EDCURVE
            command. If LCID is specified, Par1 and Par2 must be left blank (in
            the GUI, select “None” for Par1 and Par2).

        scale
            Load curve scale factor applied to the specified load curve. The
            scale value is applied to the data in Par2 or to the ordinate data
            in the load curve specified by LCID.

        btime
            Birth time, or time when imposed motion is activated. The default
            is 0.0. Some load types do not support birth and death time; see
            Table 132: Birth Time, Death Time, and CID Support in the Notes
            section for more information.

        dtime
            Death time, or time when imposed motion is removed. The default is
            1 x 1038. Some load types do not support birth and death time; see
            Table 132: Birth Time, Death Time, and CID Support in the Notes
            section for more information.

        Notes
        -----
        If a component name is input (Cname) and the specified component
        definition is changed before the SOLVE command, the last definition
        will be used.

        You can specify the load data by inputting LCID (the ID number of a
        previously defined load curve) or by inputting the two array parameters
        Par1 and Par2 (which contain time and load values, respectively). The
        input for Par1 and Par2 may be a single column array parameter, or a
        specific column from a multi-column array parameter. A starting array
        element number can be specified for Par1 and Par2; if none is
        specified, array element 1 is used by default.

        Note:: : You cannot update a previously defined load by changing the
        array parameters that were input as Par1 and Par2. The load de   f   i

            to NP2 (defaults to NP1) in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).  If NP1
            = ALL, NP2 and NINC are ignored and the pattern is all selected

            Keypoint location increments in the active coordinate system (DR,
            Dθ, DZ for cylindrical, DR, Dθ, DΦ for spherical).

        kinc
            Keypoint increment between generated sets.  If zero, the lowest
            available keypoint numbers are assigned [NUMSTR].

        noelem
            Specifies if elements and nodes are also to be generated:

            0 - Generate nodes and point elements associated with the original keypoints, if
                they exist.

            1 - Do not generate nodes and elements.

        imove
            Specifies whether keypoints will be moved or newly defined:

            0 - Generate additional keypoints as requested with the ITIME argument.

            1 - Move original keypoints to new position retaining the same keypoint numbers
                (ITIME, KINC, and NOELEM are ignored).  Valid only if the old
                keypoints are no longer needed at their original positions.

        This command only applies to the interpolation method for forces, heat
        flux, and heat generation. Displacement and temperature transfers are
        always nonconservative.

        Notes
        -----
        Prints the percent error in structural energy norm (SEPC) and the
        thermal energy norm percent error (TEPC).  Approximations of mesh
        discretization error associated with a solution are calculated for
        analyses having structural or thermal degrees of freedom.

        The structural approximation is based on the energy error (which is
        similar in concept to the strain energy) and represents the error
        associated with the discrepancy between the calculated stress field and
        the globally continuous stress field (see POST1 - Error Approximation
        Technique in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference).  This discrepancy
        is due to the assumption in the elements that only the displacements
        are continuous at the nodes.  The stress field is calculated from the
        displacements and should also be continuous, but generally is not.

        Thermal analyses may use any solid and shell thermal element having
        only temperature degrees of freedom.  The thermal approximation is
        based on the total heat flow dissipation and represents the error
        associated with the discrepancy between the calculated nodal thermal
        flux within an element and a continuous global thermal flux.  This
        continuous thermal flux is calculated with the normal nodal averaging
        procedure.

        The volume (result label VOLU) is used to calculate the energy error
        per element (result label SERR for the structural energy error and TERR
        for the thermal energy error).  These energy errors, along with the
        appropriate energy, are then used to calculate the percent error in
        energy norm (SEPC for structural and TEPC for thermal). These
        percentages can be listed by the PRERR command, retrieved by the *GET
        command (with labels SEPC and TEPC) for further calculations, and shown
        on the displacement display (PLDISP), as applicable.

        For structural analyses, the maximum absolute value of nodal stress
        variation of any stress component for any node of an element (result
        item SDSG) is also calculated.  Similarly, for thermal gradient
        components, TDSG is calculated.  Minimum and maximum result bounds
        considering the possible effect of discretization error will be shown
        on contour displays (PLNSOL).  For shell elements, the top surface
        location is used to produce a meaningful percentage value.  SERR, TERR,
        SEPC, TEPC, SDSG, and TDSG will be updated whenever the nodal stresses
        or fluxes are recalculated.

        If the energy error is a significant portion of the total energy, then
        the analysis should be repeated using a finer mesh to obtain a more
        accurate solution.  The energy error is relative from problem to
        problem but will converge to a zero energy error as the mesh is
        refined.  An automated adaptive meshing procedure using this energy
        error is described with the ADAPT macro.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows repeated surface loads (pressure, convection, etc.) to be
        replaced, added, or ignored.  Surface loads are applied with the SF,
        SFE, and SFBEAM commands.  Issue the SFELIST command to list the
        surface loads.  The operations occur when the next surface load
        specifications are defined.  For example, issuing the SF command with a
        pressure value of 25 after a previous SF command with a pressure value
        of 20 causes the current value of that pressure to be 45 with the add
        operation, 25 with the replace operation, or 20 with the ignore
        operation.  All new pressures applied with SF after the ignore
        operation will be ignored, even if no current pressure exists on that
        surface.

        Scale factors are also available to multiply the next value before the
        add or replace operation.  A scale factor of 2.0 with the previous
        "add" example results in a pressure of 70.  Scale factors are applied
        even if no previous values exist.  Issue SFCUM,STAT to show the current
        label, operation, and scale factors.  Solid model boundary conditions
        are not affected by this command, but boundary conditions on the FE
        model are affected.

        type
            Display type.  Defaults to ZBUF for raster mode displays or BASIC
            for vector mode displays:

            BASIC or 0 - Basic display (no hidden or section operations).

            SECT or 1 - Section display (plane view).  Use the /CPLANE command to define the cutting
                        plane.

            HIDC or 2 - Centroid hidden display (based on item centroid sort).

            HIDD or 3 - Face hidden display (based on face centroid sort).

            HIDP or 4 - Precise hidden display (like HIDD but with more precise checking). Because all
                        facets are sorted, this mode can be extremely slow,
                        especially for large models.

            CAP or 5 - Capped hidden display (same as combined SECT and HIDD with model in front of
                       section plane removed).

            ZBUF or 6 - Z-buffered display (like HIDD but using software Z-buffering).

            ZCAP or 7 - Capped Z-buffered display (same as combined SECT and ZBUF with model in front
                        of section plane removed).

            ZQSL or 8 - QSLICE Z-buffered display (same as SECT but the edge lines of the remaining 3-D
                        model are shown).

            HQSL or 9 - QSLICE precise hidden display (like ZQSL but using precise hidden).

        Notes
        -----
        Defines the type of display, such as section display or hidden-line
        display.  Use the /DEVICE command to specify either raster or vector
        mode.

        The SECT, CAP, ZCAP, ZQSL, and HQSL options produce section displays.
        The section or "cutting" plane is specified on the /CPLANE command as
        either normal to the viewing vector at the focus point (default), or as
        the working plane.

        When you use PowerGraphics, the section display options (Section,
        Slice, and Capped) use different averaging techniques for the interior
        and exterior results. Because of the different averaging schemes,
        anomalies may appear at the transition areas. In many cases, the
        automatically computed MIN and MAX values will differ from the full
        range of interior values. You can lessen the effect of these anomalies
        by issuing AVRES,,FULL (Main Menu> General Post Proc> Options for
        Outp). This command sets your legend's automatic contour interval range
        according to the minimum and maximum results found throughout the
        entire model.

        With PowerGraphics active (/GRAPHICS,POWER), the averaging scheme for
        surface data with interior element data included (AVRES,,FULL) and
        multiple facets per edge (/EFACET,2 or /EFACET,4) will yield differing
        minimum and maximum contour values depending on the  Z-Buffering
        options (/TYPE,,6 or /TYPE,,7).  When the Section data is not included
        in the averaging schemes (/TYPE,,7), the resulting absolute value for
        the midside node is significantly smaller.

        The HIDC, HIDD, HIDP, ZBUF, ZQSL, and HQSL options produce displays
        with "hidden" lines removed.  Hidden lines are lines obscured from view
        by another element, area, etc.  The choice of non-Z-buffered hidden-
        line procedure types is available only for raster mode [/DEVICE]
        displays.  For vector mode displays, all non-Z-buffered "hidden-line"
        options use the same procedure (which is slightly different from the
        raster procedures).  Both geometry and postprocessing displays may be
        of the hidden-line type.  Interior stress contour lines within solid
        elements can also be removed as hidden lines, leaving only the stress
        contour lines and element outlines on the visible surfaces.  Midside
        nodes of elements are ignored on postprocessing displays.  Overlapping
        elements will not be displayed.

        The ZBUF, ZCAP, and ZQSL options use a specific hidden-line technique
        called software Z-buffering.  This technique allows a more accurate
        display of overlapping surfaces (common when using Boolean operations
        or /ESHAPE on element displays), and allows smooth shaded displays on
        all interactive graphics displays.  Z-buffered displays can be
        performed faster than HIDP and CAP type displays for large models.  See
        also the /LIGHT, /SHADE, and /GFILE commands for additional options
        when Z-buffering is used.

        Generates lines (and their corresponding keypoints) by sweeping a given
        keypoint pattern along a characteristic drag path.  If the drag path
        consists of multiple lines, the drag direction is determined by the

        drag path is a single line (NL1), the drag direction is from the
        keypoint on the drag line that is closest to the first keypoint of the
        given pattern to the other end of the drag line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        item
            Predefined vector item (from Table 226: PRVECT - Valid Item and
            Component Labels below) or a label identifying the i-component of a
            user-defined vector.

        lab2
            Label identifying the j-component of a user-defined vector. In most
            cases, this value must be blank if Item is selected from
            Table 226: PRVECT - Valid Item and Component Labels. Individual
            principal stresses (Item = S) or principal strains (Item = EPxx)
            may be printed by specifying the value as 1, 2, or 3.

        lab3
            Label identifying the k-component of a user-defined vector.  Must
            be blank if Item is selected from list below or for 2-D user
            defined vector.

        labp
            Label assigned to resultant vector for printout labeling (defaults
            to Item).

        Notes
        -----
        Prints various solution results as vector magnitude and direction
        cosines for the selected nodes and/or elements.  For example, PRVECT,U
        prints the displacement magnitude and its direction cosines for all
        selected nodes.  For nodal degree of freedom vector results, direction
        cosines are with respect to the results coordinate system RSYS. For
        element results, direction cosines are with respect to the global
        Cartesian system. Item components may be printed with the PRNSOL
        command.  Various results also depend upon the recalculation method and
        the selected results location [LAYER, SHELL, NSEL, and ESEL].  Items
        may be selected from a set of recognized vector labels (Item) or a
        vector may be defined from up to three scalar labels (Item,Lab2,Lab3).
        Scalar labels may be user-defined with the ETABLE command.

        par
            Name of the mask parameter.  The starting subscript must also be
            specified.

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies the name of the parameter whose values are to be checked for
        each resulting row operation.  The mask vector usually contains only 0
        (for false) and 1 (for true) values.  For each row operation the
        corresponding mask vector value is checked.  A true value allows the
        operation to be done.  A false value skips the operation (and retains
        the previous results).  A mask vector can be created from direct input,
        such as M(1) = 1,0,0,1,1,0,1; or from the DATA function of the *VFILL
        command.  The NOT function of the *VFUN command can be used to reverse
        the logical sense of the mask vector.  The logical compare operations
        (LT, LE, EQ, NE, GE, and GT) of the *VOPER command also produce a mask
        vector by operating on two other vectors.  Any numeric vector can be
        used as a mask vector since the actual interpretation assumes values
        less than 0.0 are 0.0 (false) and values greater than 0.0 are 1.0
        (true).  If the mask vector is not specified (or has fewer values than
        the result vector), true (1.0) values are assumed for the unspecified
        values.  Another skip control may be input with NINC on the *VLEN
        command.  If both are present, operations occur only when both are
        true.  The mask setting is reset to the default (no mask) after each
        *VXX or *MXX operation.  Use *VSTAT to list settings.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method
            Mode extraction method to be used for the buckling analysis:

            LANB - Block Lanczos

            SUBSP - Subspace iteration

        nmode
            Number of buckling modes (i.e., eigenvalues or load multipliers) to
            extract (defaults to 1).

        shift
            By default, this value acts as the initial shift point about which
            the buckling modes are calculated (defaults to 0.0).

        ldmulte
            Boundary for the load multiplier range of interest (defaults to ).

        rangekey
            Key used to control the behavior of the eigenvalue extraction
            method (defaults to CENTER):

            CENTER - Use the CENTER option control (default); the program computes NMODE buckling
                     modes centered around SHIFT in the range of (-LDMULTE,
                     +LDMULTE).

            RANGE - Use the RANGE option control; the program computes NMODE buckling modes in the
                    range of (SHIFT, LDMULTE).

        Notes
        -----
        Eigenvalues from a buckling analysis can be negative and/or positive.
        The program sorts the eigenvalues from the most negative to the most
        positive values. The minimum buckling load factor may correspond to the
        smallest eigenvalue in absolute value, or to an eigenvalue within the
        range, depending on your application (i.e., linear perturbation
        buckling analysis or purely linear buckling analysis).

        It is recommended that you request an additional few buckling modes
        beyond what is needed in order to enhance the accuracy of the final
        solution. It is also recommended that you input a non zero SHIFT value
        and a reasonable LDMULTE value (i.e., a smaller LDMULTE that is closer
        to the last buckling mode of interest) when numerical problems are
        encountered.

        When using the RANGE option, defining a range that spans zero is not
        recommended. If you are seeking both negative and positive eigenvalues,
        it is recommended that you use the CENTER option.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.  If used in SOLUTION, this command
        is valid only within the first load step.

        Distributed ANSYS Restriction: Both extraction methods (LANB and SUBSP)
        are supported within Distributed ANSYS. However, the subspace iteration
        eigensolver (SUBSP) is the only distributed eigensolver that will run a
        fully distributed solution. The Block Lanczos eigensolver (LANB) is not
        a distributed eigensolver; therefore, you will not see the full
        performance improvements with this method that you would with a fully
        distributed solution.

        Generates cylindrical volumes (and their corresponding keypoints,
        lines, and areas) by rotating an area pattern (and its associated line
        and keypoint patterns) about an axis.  Keypoint patterns are generated
        at regular angular locations (based on a maximum spacing of 90°).  Line
        patterns are generated at the keypoint patterns.  Arc lines are also
        generated to connect the keypoints circumferentially.  Keypoint, line,
        area, and volume numbers are automatically assigned (beginning with the
        lowest available values).  Adjacent lines use a common keypoint,
        adjacent areas use a common line, and adjacent volumes use a common
        area.

        To generate a single volume with an arc greater than 180°, NSEG must be
        greater than or equal to 2.

        If element attributes have been associated with the input area via the
        AATT command, the opposite area generated by the VROTAT operation will
        also have those attributes (i.e., the element attributes from the input
        area are copied to the opposite area).  Note that only the area
        opposite the input area will have the same attributes as the input
        area; the areas adjacent to the input area will not.

        If the given areas are meshed or belong to meshed volumes, the 2-D mesh
        can be rotated (extruded) to a 3-D mesh. See the Modeling and Meshing

            Status of the analysis (new or restart).

            0 - New analysis (default).

            1 - Simple restart.

            2 - Small restart.

            3 - Full restart.

        memory
            Memory to be used (in words). If blank, LS-DYNA assigns a value
            (default). If more or less memory is needed, specify the number of
            words (a word is usually 32 bits on a workstation).

        fsize
            Scale factor for binary file sizes. Defaults to 7, which is
            (7x262144) = 1835008 words.

        dumpfile
            Name of dump file to use during a restart (for example, d3dumpnn,

            blank when running a new analysis (RESTART = 0) so that the default
            dump file d3dump01 will be created.

        Notes
        -----
        EDSTART can be issued before the SOLVE command to specify a new
        analysis, a simple restart, a small restart, or a full restart as
        described below.

        New analysis: For a new analysis, you do not need to issue EDSTART
        unless you want to change the MEMORY or FSIZE option. If you do not
        specify the dump file name, d3dump01 will be created by default.

        Simple restart: This option assumes that the database has not been
        altered. Upon restarting, results will be appended to the existing
        results files. Issue EDSTART,1,,,d3dumpnn to indicate which restart
        file to use as a starting point. The dump file to be used must have
        been created in an earlier run and must be available at the time this
        command is issued.  You would typically use a simple restart when you
        interrupt the LS-DYNA run via Ctrl+C and terminate the run prematurely
        by issuing the "sense switch control" key SW1 (see Solution Control and
        Monitoring in the ANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide). At this point you should
        be able to view the partial solution using ANSYS postprocessors. After
        you are done viewing the partial solution, you can reenter the solution
        processor and issue EDSTART,1,,,d3dumpnn, followed by SOLVE to continue
        with the analysis. The results will be appended to the results files
        Jobname.RST and Jobname.HIS.  You can perform multiple simple restarts
        by issuing EDSTART,1,,,d3dumpnn multiple times, as needed. The
        solutions in the Jobname.RST file will all be in load step number 1.

        Small restart: This option can be used when minor changes in the
        database are necessary. For example, you can reset the termination
        time, reset the output interval, add displacement constraints, change
        initial velocities, switch parts from a deformable to rigid state, etc.
        (See A Small Restart in theANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide for a complete
        description of database items that can be changed.) Issue
        EDSTART,2,,,d3dumpnn followed by the commands required to change the
        database, then issue SOLVE. The results will be appended to the results
        files Jobname.RST and Jobname.HIS. You can perform multiple restarts by
        issuing EDSTART,2,,,d3dumpnn multiple times, as needed. The additional
        restart solutions will be stored in Jobname.RST as load step numbers 2,
        3, etc.

        Full restart: A full restart is appropriate when many modifications to
        the database are required. For example, you can change the model
        geometry, apply different loading conditions, etc. Issue
        EDSTART,3,,,d3dumpnn to denote a full restart analysis. The Jobname
        will automatically be changed to Jobname_nn, (nn = 01 initially, and
        will be incremented each time EDSTART,3 is issued for subsequent full
        restarts). After the EDSTART command, you can input any commands needed
        to change the database. (Most commands which are applicable to an ANSYS
        LS-DYNA new analysis are also applicable to full restart analysis. A
        few commands related to contact specifications, initial velocity
        definitions, and adaptive meshing are not supported.) Then issue the
        EDIS command to specify which portions of the model should be
        initialized in the full restart using results data from the d3dumpnn
        file. Finally, issue the SOLVE command. At this point, new results
        files, Jobname_nn.RST and Jobname_nn.HIS, will be created. Time and
        output intervals in the new results files are continuous from the
        previous results files; the time is not reset to zero. (See A Full
        Restart in the ANSYS LS-DYNA User's Guide for a complete description of
        a full restart analysis.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        method
            Mapping method:

            0 - Hybrid method (default).

            1 - Projection method.

            2 - Minimum centroid distance method.

        namesurf
            Component name for a group of SURF151 or SURF152 elements. The name
            must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'COM152') when the MSTOLE
            command is manually typed in.

        Notes
        -----
        For convection analyses, the MSTOLE command adds two extra nodes from
        FLUID116 elements to SURF151 or SURF152 elements by employing the
        specified mapping method. In the hybrid method, the projection method
        is tried first and if it fails the centroid distance method is used.
        The SURF151 or SURF152 elements and the FLUID116 elements must be
        grouped into components and named using the CM command.

        The SURF151 or SURF152 extra node option must be set for two extra
        nodes (KEYOPT(5) = 2).

            Reference number of coordinate system where the pattern is to be

            The coordinate system type and parameters of KCNTO must be the same

            Transfer lines from pattern beginning with NL1 to NL2 (defaults to
            NL1) in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).  If NL1 = ALL, NL2 and NINC

        noelem
            Specifies whether nodes and elements are also to be generated:

            FULL - Average surface results data using the exterior face and interior element data.

        Notes
        -----
        The AVRES command specifies how results data will be averaged at
        subgrid locations that are common to 2 or more elements.  The command
        is valid only when PowerGraphics is enabled (via the /GRAPHICS,POWER
        command).

        With PowerGraphics active (/GRAPHICS,POWER), the averaging scheme for
        surface data with interior element data included (AVRES,,FULL) and
        multiple facets per edge (/EFACET,2 or /EFACET,4) will yield differing
        minimum and maximum contour values depending on the  Z-Buffering
        options (/TYPE,,6 or /TYPE,,7).  When the Section data is not included
        in the averaging schemes (/TYPE,,7), the resulting absolute value for
        the midside node is significantly smaller.

        PowerGraphics does not average your stresses across discontinuous
        surfaces. The normals for various planes and facets are compared to a
        tolerance to determine continuity. The ANGLE value you specify in the
        /EDGE command is the tolerance for classifying surfaces as continuous
        or “coplanar.”

        The command affects nodal solution contour plots (PLNSOL), nodal
        solution printout (PRNSOL), and subgrid solution results accessed
        through the Query Results function (under General Postprocessing) in
        the GUI.

        The command has no effect on the nodal degree of freedom solution
        values (UX, UY, UZ, TEMP, etc.).

        For cyclic symmetry mode-superposition harmonic solutions, AVRES,,FULL
        is not supported. Additionally, averaging does not occur across
        discontinuous surfaces, and the ANGLE value on the /EDGE command has no
        effect.

        The command is also available in /SOLU.

        Defines master degrees of freedom (MDOF) for superelement generation.
        If defined for other analyses, MDOF are ignored.  If used in SOLUTION,
        this command is valid only within the first load step.

        Repeat M command for additional master degrees of freedom.  The limit
        for the number of master nodes used is determined by the maximum system
        memory available.

        The substructure (ANTYPE,SUBSTR) analysis utilizes the matrix
        condensation technique to reduce the structure matrices to those
        characterized by a set of master degrees of freedom.

        Master degrees of freedom are identified by a list of nodes and their
        nodal directions.  The actual degree of freedom directions available
        for a particular node depends upon the degrees of freedom associated
        with element types (ET) at that node.  There must be some mass (or
        stress stiffening in the case of the buckling analysis) associated with
        each master degree of freedom (except for the VOLT label).  The mass
        may be due either to the distributed mass of the element or due to
        discrete lumped masses at the node.  If a master degree of freedom is
        specified at a constrained point, it is ignored.  If a master degree of
        freedom is specified at a coupled node, it should be specified at the
        prime node of the coupled set.

        Substructure analysis connection points must be defined as master
        degrees of freedom.

        Notes
        -----
        MP defines a linear material property as a constant or in terms of a
        fourth order polynomial as a function of temperature. (See the TB
        command for nonlinear material property input.) Linear material
        properties typically require a single substep for solution, whereas
        nonlinear material properties require multiple substeps;  see Linear
        Material Properties in the Material Reference for details.

        If the constants C1 - C4 are input, the polynomial

        Property = C0 + C1(T) + C2(T)2 + C3(T)3 + C4(T)4

        is evaluated at discrete temperature points with linear interpolation
        between points (that is, a piecewise linear representation) and a
        constant-valued extrapolation beyond the extreme points. First-order
        properties use two discrete points (±9999°). The MPTEMP or MPTGEN
        commands must be used for second and higher order properties to define
        appropriate temperature steps. To ensure that the number of
        temperatures defined via the MPTEMP and MPTGEN commands is minimally
        sufficient for a reasonable representation of the curve, ANSYS
        generates an error message if the number is less than N, and a warning
        message if the number is less than 2N. The value N represents the
        highest coefficient used; for example, if C3 is nonzero and C4 is zero,
        a cubic curve is being used which is defined using 4 coefficients so

        APDL Command: VGLUE

        Parameters
        ----------
        nv1, nv2, nv3, . . . , nv9
            Numbers of the volumes to be glued.  If NV1 = ALL, all selected

        Notes
        -----
        Use of the VGLUE command generates new volumes by "gluing" input
        volumes.  The glue operation redefines the input volumes so that they
        share areas along their common boundaries.  The new volumes encompass
        the same geometry as the original volumes.  This operation is only
        valid if the intersections of the input volumes are areas along the
        boundaries of those volumes.  See the Modeling and Meshing Guide for an
        illustration.  See the BOPTN command for an explanation of the options
        available to Boolean operations.  Element attributes and solid model
        boundary conditions assigned to the original entities will not be
        transferred to the new entities generated.

        The VGLUE command results in the merging of areas, lines, and keypoints
        at the common volume boundaries. The areas, lines, and keypoints of the
        lower numbered volume will be kept. This means one must be aware of
        volume numbering when multiple VGLUE commands are applied to avoid any
        "ungluing" of geometry.

        Invokes a graphical editing system that displays array parameter values

        ----------
        signif
            Combine only those modes whose significance level exceeds the
            SIGNIF threshold.  For single point, multipoint, or DDAM response
            (SPOPT,SPRS, MPRS or DDAM), the significance level of a mode is
            defined as the mode coefficient of the mode, divided by the maximum
            mode coefficient of all modes.  Any mode whose significance level
            is less than SIGNIF is considered insignificant and is not
            contributed to the mode combinations.  The higher the SIGNIF
            threshold, the fewer the number of modes combined.  SIGNIF defaults
            to 0.001.  If SIGNIF is specified as 0.0, it is taken as 0.0.
            (This mode combination method is not valid for SPOPT,PSD.)

        label
            Label identifying the combined mode solution output.

            VELO - Velocity solution.  Velocities, "stress velocities," "force velocities," etc.,
                   are available.

            ACEL - Acceleration solution.  Accelerations, "stress accelerations," "force
                   accelerations," etc., are available.

        forcetype
            Label identifying the forces to be combined:

            STATIC - Combine the modal static forces (default).

            TOTAL - Combine the modal static plus inertial forces.

            n - Arbitrary set number.

            HIGH - The highest defined coupled set number will be used (default, unless Lab =

        lab
            Degree of freedom label for coupled nodes (in the nodal coordinate
            system).  Defaults to label previously defined with NSET if set
            NSET already exists. A different label redefines the previous label
            associated with NSET.  Valid labels are: Structural labels:  UX,
            UY, or UZ (displacements); ROTX, ROTY, or ROTZ (rotations) (in
            radians); HDSP (hydrostatic pressure). Thermal labels: TEMP, TBOT,
            TE2, TE3, . . ., TTOP (temperature).  Fluid labels:  PRES
            (pressure);  VX, VY, or VZ (velocities).  Electric labels:  VOLT
            (voltage);  EMF (electromotive force drop);  CURR (current).
            Magnetic labels:  MAG (scalar magnetic potential); AX, AY, or AZ

            CONC (concentration). Explicit analysis labels:  UX, UY, or UZ
            (displacements).

        node1, node2, node3, . . . , node17
            List of nodes to be included in set. Duplicate nodes are ignored.
            If a node number is input as negative, the node is deleted from the
            coupled set. The first node in the list is the primary (retained)
            node, and the remaining nodes represent the removed degrees of
            freedom. If NODE1 = ALL, NODE2 through NODE17 are ignored and all
            selected nodes (NSEL) are included in the set.  If NODE1 = P,
            graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields are
            ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A component name may also be
            substituted for NODE1.

        Notes
        -----
        Do not include the same degree of freedom in more than one coupled set.
        Repeat CP command for additional nodes.

        Coupling degrees of freedom into a set causes the results calculated
        for one member of the set to be the same for all members of the set.
        Coupling can be used to model various joint and hinge effects.  A more
        general form of coupling can be done with constraint equations (CE).
        For structural analyses, a list of nodes is defined along with the
        nodal directions in which these nodes are to be coupled.  As a result
        of this coupling, these nodes are forced to take the same displacement
        in the specified nodal coordinate direction.  The amount of the
        displacement is unknown until the analysis is completed.  A set of
        coupled nodes which are not coincident, or which are not along the line
        of the coupled displacement direction, may produce an applied moment
        which will not appear in the reaction forces.  The actual degrees of
        freedom available for a particular node depends upon the degrees of
        freedom associated with element types (ET) at that node. For scalar
        field analysis, this command is used to couple nodal temperatures,
        pressures, voltages, etc.

        For an explicit dynamic analysis, the only valid DOF labels for
        coupling are UX, UY, and UZ. Since the rotational DOF (ROTX, ROTY,
        ROTZ) are not allowed. The CP family of commands should not be used in
        an explicit analysis to model rigid body behavior that involves
        rotations. If CP is used in this manner, it could lead to nonphysical
        responses.

        A set of coupled nodes which are not coincident, or which are not along
        the line of the coupled displacement direction, produce an artificial
        moment constraint.  If the structure rotates, a moment may be produced
        in the coupled set in the form of a force couple.  This moment is in
        addition to the real reaction forces and may make it appear that moment
        equilibrium is not satisfied by just the applied forces and the
        reaction forces. Note, however, that in an explicit dynamic analysis,
        this artificial moment will not be produced. Rather, just the applied
        forces and the reaction forces will satisfy the moment equilibrium in
        the model. Thus, in an explicit analysis, the magnitude of nodal
        displacements for this set of nodes will depend on the distance from
        each node to the center of the coupled set, and the direction of
        displacement will depend on the resulting moment. This may lead to a
        nonphysical response in some cases.

        Additional sets of coupled nodes may be generated from a specified set.
        Degrees of freedom are coupled within a set but are not coupled between
        sets.  No degree of freedom should appear in more than one coupled set.
        Such an appearance would indicate that at least two sets were in fact
        part of a single larger set.  The first degree of freedom of the
        coupled set is the "prime" degree of freedom.  All other degrees of
        freedom in the coupled sets are eliminated from the solution matrices
        by their relationship to the prime degree of freedom.  Forces applied
        to coupled nodes (in the coupled degree of freedom direction) will be
        summed and applied to the prime degree of freedom.  Output forces are
        also summed at the prime degree of freedom.  Degrees of freedom with
        specified constraints (D) should not be included in a coupled set
        (unless the degree of freedom is prime).

        If master degrees of freedom are defined for coupled nodes, only the
        prime degree of freedom should be so defined. The use of coupled nodes
        reduces the set of coupled degrees of freedom to only one degree of
        freedom.

        The removed degrees of freedom defined by the CP command cannot be
        included in any CE or CERIG command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        area
            Area to which surface load applies.  If ALL, apply load to all

        lkey
            Load key associated with surface load (defaults to 1).  Load keys
            (1,2,3, etc.) are listed under "Surface Loads" in the input data
            table for each element type in the Element Reference.  LKEY is
            ignored if the area is the face of a volume region meshed with

        value
            Surface load value or table name reference for specifying tabular

            It is good practice to list all definitions using GCDEF,LIST,ALL,ALL before and after a GCDEF,DELETE command. - LIST

            inputs for SECT1 and SECT2 are interpreted.

        matid
            Material ID number for general contact interaction properties at
            the SECT1/SECT2 interface. If zero or blank, the previous setting
            of MATID for SECT1/SECT2 (if any) is retained.

        Notes
        -----
        GCDEF defines the interface interaction between general contact
        surfaces identified by SECT1 and SECT2. GCDEF commands are order
        independent in most cases.

        GCDEF definitions should be issued after GCGEN. They are saved in the
        database and are written to and read from .CDB files.

        information on the overall procedure to create general contact.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum, including the
            characters needed for the directory path).  An unspecified
            directory path defaults to the working directory; in this case, you
            can use all 248 characters for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        --
            Unused field.

        Notes
        -----
        Identifies a macro library file for the *USE command.  A library of
        macros allows blocks of often used ANSYS commands to be stacked and
        executed from a single file.  The macro blocks must be enclosed within
        block identifier and terminator lines as shown in the example below.
        If you want to add comment lines to a macro block, you may place them
        anywhere within the macro block.  (This includes placing them directly
        on the lines where the macro block identifier and the macro block
        terminator appear, as shown in the example.)  Do not place comment
        lines (or any other lines) outside of a macro block.

        The name of the macro library file is identified for reading on the
        *ULIB command.   The name of the macro block is identified on the *USE
        command.  The commands within the macro block are copied to a temporary
        file (of the macro block name) during the *USE  operation and executed
        as if a macro file of that name had been created by the user.  The
        temporary file is deleted after it has been used.  Macro block names
        should be acceptable filenames (system dependent) and should not match
        user created macro file names, since the user macro file will be used
        first (if it exists) before the library file is searched.  Macro blocks
        may be stacked in any order.  Branching  [*GO or  *IF] external to the
        macro block is not allowed.

        APDL Command: EXPROFILE

        Exports interface loads or loads on selected nodes to an ANSYS CFX
        Profile file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ldtype
            Load type:

            SURF  - Surface load.

            VOLU  - Volumetric load.

        load
            Surface loads:

            DISP  - Displacement (in a static analysis) or mode shape and global parameters (in a
                    modal analysis).

            MODE  - Normalized mode shape and global parameters (in a modal analysis only).

            TEMP  - Temperature.

            HFLU  - Heat flux.

        value
            If a positive integer, specifies the number of the surface or
            volume interface. If 0 (zero), the selected nodes or Named
            Selection are used.

        pname
            Field name in CFX Profile file (32-character maximum). Defaults to
            jobname_bcploadnumber for a surface load and jobname_subdloadnumber
            for volumetric load.

        fname
            The CFX Profile filename (248-character maximum). Defaults to
            jobname_bcploadnumber for a surface load and jobname_subdloadnumber
            for a volumetric load.

        fext
            The Profile file extension (8-character maximum). Defaults to.csv.

        fdir
            The Profile file directory (8-character maximum). Defaults to
            current directory.

        Notes
        -----
        By default, the EXPROFILE command assumes the data it writes to the
        Profile file are in SI units. For models not described in SI units,
        issue the EXUNIT command as needed to write the correct unit labels on
        the Profile file.

        For a modal analysis, if Load = DISP or MODE, global parameters
        including mass, frequency, and maximum displacement are also written to
        the ANSYS CFX Profile file. You should therefore issue the EXUNIT
        command for DISP, TIME, and MASS.

        Verify that the coordinate system is set to the global Cartesian
        (RSYS,0) before using this command.

        To transfer multiple loads across an interface, specify a unique file
        name and extension for each load.

        Force (FORC) and heat generation (HGEN) are per-unit volume.

        For modal analysis, this command does not support the following mode-
        extraction methods (MODOPT): unsymmetric matrix (UNSYM), the damped
        system (DAMP), or the QR-damped system (QRDAMP).

        To write the normalized (instead of non-normalized) mode shapes from a
        modal analysis to the file:

        Use Load = MODE.

        Verify that the mode shapes are normalized to the mass matrix
        (MODOPT,,,,,,OFF), the default behavior.

        Verify that the scale factor is set to 1.0 (SET,,,1.0), the default
        value.

        For loads not specified directly via commands (such as SF and BF),
        loads must first be read into the database (SET or LCASE).

            level of information.

        Notes
        -----
        *GET retrieves a value for a specified item and stores the value as a
        scalar parameter, or as a value in a user-named array parameter. An
        item is identified by various keyword, label, and number combinations.
        Usage is similar to the *SET command except that the parameter values
        are retrieved from previously input or calculated results. For example,
        *GET,A,ELEM,5,CENT,X returns the centroid x-location of element 5 and
        stores the result as parameter A. *GET command operations, along with
        the associated Get functions return values in the active coordinate
        system unless stated otherwise. A Get function is an alternative in-
        line function that can be used to retrieve a value instead of the *GET
        command (see Using In-line Get Functions for more information).

        Both *GET and *VGET retrieve information from the active data stored in
        memory. The database is often the source, and sometimes the information
        is retrieved from common memory blocks that the program uses to
        manipulate information. Although POST1 and POST26 operations use a
        *.rst file, *GET data is accessed from the database or from the common
        blocks. Get operations do not access the *.rst file directly. For
        repeated gets of sequential items, such as from a series of elements,
        see the *VGET command.

        Most items are stored in the database after they are calculated and are
        available anytime thereafter. Items are grouped according to where they

        Notes
        -----
        The COMBINE command is used within the AUX2 auxiliary processor to
        combine local solution files from a distributed memory parallel
        solution into a single, global file. Before using this command, you
        must enter the AUX2 processor by issuing the /AUX2 command.

        In a distributed memory parallel (Distributed ANSYS) solution, you can
        use the DMPOPTION command to bypass the file combination step, causing
        all individual local files to be kept on the local disks in the current
        working directory. Later on, you can start a new distributed memory
        parallel solution and use the COMBINE command to combine local files
        into a global file for a downstream solution or another operation
        (e.g., postprocessing with /POST1). For example, the command
        COMBINE,RST will combine local results files (JobnameN.RST) into a
        global results file (Jobname.RST).

        When the COMBINE command is used in a subsequent Distributed ANSYS
        session, the number of processors must be the same as in the
        distributed memory parallel solution that generated the files.

        When running on a cluster, the local solution files must be available
        in the working directory on each node in the subsequent session. As an
        example, consider the following command line used to generate local
        solution files:

        Different machines can be used in the subsequent session to combine
        these files. However, the total number of cores must remain unchanged
        (seven in the above case), and the local files must be copied to the
        working directory (or directories) on each of the machines used in the
        subsequent session.

        APDL Command: RESP

        Generates a response spectrum.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ir
            Arbitrary reference number assigned to the response spectrum
            results (2 to NV [NUMVAR]).  If this number is the same as for a
            previously defined variable, the previously defined variable will
            be overwritten with these results.

        lftab
            Reference number of variable containing frequency table (created
            with FILLDATA or DATA command).  The frequency table defines the
            number and frequency of oscillating systems used to determine the
            response spectrum. The frequency interval need not be constant over
            the entire range. Frequencies must be input in ascending order.

        ldtab
            Reference number of variable containing the input time-history.

        spectype
            Defines the type of response spectrum to be calculated:

            0 or 1 - Displacement (relative to base excitation)

            2 - Velocity (relative to base excitation)

            3 - Acceleration response spectrum (absolute)

            4 - Pseudo-velocity

            5 - Pseudo-acceleration

        dampratio
            Ratio of viscous damping to critical damping (input as a decimal
            number).

        dtime
            Integration time step. This value should be equal to or greater
            than the integration time step used in the initial transient
            analysis performed to generate the input time-history (LDTAB).

        tmin, tmax
            Specifies a subset of the displacement-time history to be used in
            the response spectrum calculation.  Defaults to the full time
            range.

        inputtype
            Defines the type of the input time-history:

            0 - Displacement (default)

            1 - Acceleration

        Notes
        -----
        This command generates a response spectrum from a displacement or
        acceleration time-history and frequency data. The response spectrum is
        defined as the maximum response of single degree of freedom systems of
        varying frequency (or period) to a given input support excitation.

        A response spectrum analysis (ANTYPE, SPECTR with SPOPT, SPRS or MPRS)
        requires a response spectrum input. This input can be determined from
        the response spectrum printout or display of this command.

        If a response spectrum is to be calculated from a given displacement
        (or acceleration) time-history, the displacement time-history may be
        input to a single one-element reduced linear transient dynamic
        (ANTYPE,TRANS) analysis, so that the calculated output (which should be
        the same as the input) will be properly located on the file.

        The integration time step (argument DTIME on the RESP command) and the
        damping coefficient (argument dampRatio) are constant over the
        frequency range. The number of calculations done per response spectrum
        curve is the product of the number of input solution points (TMAX-
        TMIN)/DTIME and the number of frequency points (frequencies located in
        variable LFTAB).

         Input solution points requested (using DTIME and the frequency range)
        at a time not corresponding to an actual displacement solution time on
        the file are linearly interpolated with respect to the existing points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Mode label:

            ACCU - Allows ANSYS to use the accumulation buffer for OpenGL graphics. Activating
                   this feature will provide faster model rotation when shaded
                   backgrounds are in use. This feature is off by default.

            ACTR - Label term to designate the cursor position as the center for automatic dynamic
                   rotational center capability.  The subsequent Key value (see
                   below) turns this capability on and off. This feature is on
                   by default. (Available for OpenGL displays only)

            ANIM - Animation mode.  The ANIM option allows you to create animation frames in
                   pixmap mode instead of display list mode.  This may improve
                   large model performance, but it eliminates local
                   manipulation while animation is in progress. This feature is
                   on by default.

            ANTI - Label term to control Anti-aliasing, a smoothing technique for your graph
                   plots. (see below) The subsequent Key value turns this
                   capability on and off. The default for this feature is off.
                   (Available for OpenGL displays only).

            CNTR - Switches banded contours on (1) or off (0) for your 3–D contour display. The
                   default is 1 (ON). Other contour parameters such as number
                   of contours or the increment and range are defined using the
                   /CONTOUR command. When either 9 or 128 contours are
                   specified via /CONTOUR, this command is ignored and a smooth
                   contour is always displayed.

            DGEN - Local manipulation degenerate mode.  You access the DGEN option to set wire-
                   frame local manipulation mode for 3-D devices (device
                   dependent). This feature is off by default.

            DLIST - With DLIST, you can specify whether screen updates and redraws will be
                    performed using the ANSYS Display List (off), or the 3-D
                    device's Display List (on). DLIST is on by default for
                    Windows systems, but off for Linux.

            DELS - You use DELS to suppress contour display screen overwrites when /NOERASE is
                   active. This prevents the bleed-through that occurs when you
                   overlay contour plots.

            TRIS - Triangle strip mode. Tri-stripping provides faster 3-D display capabilities and
                   is on by default. Some display enhancements, such as
                   texturing, are adversely affected by tri-stripping. You can
                   turn off tri-stripping in order to improve these display
                   functions. Be sure to turn tri-stripping on after the
                   desired output is obtained.

        key
            The following key options apply to Lab = ACCU:

            0 - (OFF)  The accumulation buffer is not accessed. (default)

            1 - (ON)  Access to the buffer is enabled.

        Notes
        -----
        ANSYS uses display list animation for its 3-D models. This memory
        resident array method interfaces with the OpenGL model information to
        allow the program to efficiently pan, zoom, rotate and dynamically
        manipulate your model during animation. The logo, legend, contour and
        other annotation items are produced in 2-D and will not appear when
        /DV3D, ANIM, 0 is in effect. To display these items, use /DV3D, ANIM,
        1. All screen data will be displayed, but manipulation of the model
        will not be possible.

        APDL Command: MOPT

        Specifies meshing options.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lab
            Meshing option to be specified (determines the meaning of Value):

            AORDER - Mesh by ascending area size order.  Set Value to ON to mesh smaller areas
                     first. Using this results in finer meshes in critical
                     areas for volume meshes; this can be used for cases where
                     SMRTSIZE does not mesh as needed. Default is OFF.

            EXPND - Area mesh expansion (or contraction) option.  (This option is the same as
                    SMRTSIZE,,,EXPND.) This option is used to size internal
                    elements in an area based on the size of the elements on
                    the area's boundaries.

            Value is the expansion (or contraction) factor. For example, issuing MOPT,EXPND,2 before meshing an area will allow a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the interior of an area as they are on the boundary. If Value is less than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the area will be allowed. Value for this option should be greater than 0.5 but less than 4.  - Value defaults to 1, which does not allow expansion or contraction of internal
                              element sizes (except when using AESIZE sizing).
                              If Value = 0, the default value of 1 will be
                              used. The actual size of the internal elements
                              will also depend on the TRANS option (or upon
                              AESIZE or ESIZE sizing, if used).

            TETEXPND - Tet-mesh expansion (or contraction) option. This option is used to size
                       internal elements in a volume based on the size of the
                       elements on the volume's boundaries.

            Value is the expansion (or contraction) factor.  For example, issuing MOPT,TETEXPND,2 before meshing a volume will allow a mesh with elements that are approximately twice as large in the interior of the volume as they are on the boundary. If Value is less than 1, a mesh with smaller elements on the interior of the volume will be allowed. Value for this option should be greater than 0.1 but less than 3.   - Value defaults to 1, which does not allow expansion or contraction of internal
                              element sizes.  If Value = 0, the default value
                              of 1 will be used. If Value is greater than 2,
                              mesher robustness may be affected.

            The TETEXPND option is supported for both the VMESH and FVMESH commands.  Tet-mesh expansion is the only mesh control supported by FVMESH. - TRANS

            Mesh-transition option. Controls how rapidly elements are permitted to change in size from the boundary to the interior of an area. (This option performs the same operation as SMRTSIZE,,,,TRANS.)   - Value is the transitioning factor. Value defaults to 2.0, which permits
                              elements to approximately double in size as they
                              approach the interior of the area.  (If Value =
                              0, the default value of 2 will be used.) Value
                              must be greater than 1 and, for best results,
                              should be less than 4.  The actual size of the
                              internal elements will also depend on the EXPND
                              option (or upon AESIZE or ESIZE sizing, if used).

            For a quad mesh with any element size, this option has no effect, as the program strictly respects any face size to ensure the most uniform quad mesh possible. To obtain a graded mesh using this option, apply LESIZE to the lines of the desired face. - AMESH

            Triangle surface-meshing option.  Valid inputs for Value are:     - DEFAULT

            Allows the program to choose which triangle mesher to use.  In most cases, the program chooses the main triangle mesher, which is the Riemann space mesher.  If the chosen mesher fails for any reason, the program invokes the alternate mesher and retries the meshing operation. - MAIN

            The program uses the main triangle mesher (Riemann space mesher), and it does not invoke an alternate mesher if the main mesher fails.  The Riemann space mesher is well suited for most surfaces. - ALTERNATE

            The program uses the first alternate triangle mesher (3-D tri-mesher), and it does not invoke another mesher if this mesher fails.  This option is not recommended due to speed considerations.  However, for surfaces with degeneracies in parametric space, this mesher often provides the best results. - ALT2

            The program uses the second alternate triangle mesher (2-D parametric space mesher), and it does not invoke another mesher if this mesher fails.  This option is not recommended for use on surfaces with degeneracies (spheres, cones, etc.) or poorly parameterized surfaces because poor meshes may result. - QMESH

            Quadrilateral surface meshing option.  (Quadrilateral surface meshes will differ based on which triangle surface mesher is selected.  This is true because all free quadrilateral meshing algorithms use a triangle mesh as a starting point.)  Valid inputs for Value are:     - DEFAULT

            Let the program choose which quadrilateral mesher to use.  In most cases, the program will choose the main quadrilateral mesher, which is the Q-Morph (quad-morphing) mesher.  For very coarse meshes, the program may choose the alternate quadrilateral mesher instead.  In most cases, the Q-Morph mesher results in higher quality elements.  If either mesher fails for any reason, the program invokes the other mesher and retries the meshing operation.  (Default.) - MAIN

            The program uses the main quadrilateral mesher (Q-Morph mesher), and it does not invoke the alternate mesher if the main mesher fails. - ALTERNATE

            The program uses the alternate quadrilateral mesher, and it does not invoke the Q-Morph mesher if the alternate mesher fails.  To use the alternate quadrilateral mesher, you must also select MOPT,AMESH,ALTERNATE or MOPT,AMESH,ALT2. - VMESH

            Tetrahedral element meshing option.  Valid inputs for Value are:     - DEFAULT

            Let the program choose which tetrahedra mesher to use.   - MAIN

            Use the main tetrahedra mesher (Delaunay technique mesher).  (GHS3D meshing technology by P. L. George, INRIA, France.)  For most models, this mesher is significantly faster than the alternate mesher. - ALTERNATE

            Use the alternate tetrahedra mesher (advancing front mesher).  This mesher does not support the generation of a tetrahedral volume mesh from facets (FVMESH).  If this mesher is selected and you issue the FVMESH command, the program uses the main tetrahedra mesher to create the mesh from facets and issues a warning message to notify you. - SPLIT

            Quad splitting option for non-mapped meshing.  If Value = 1, ON, or ERR, quadrilateral elements in violation of shape error limits are split into triangles (default).  If Value = 2 or WARN, quadrilateral elements in violation of either shape error or warning limits are split into triangles.  If Value = OFF, splitting does not occur, regardless of element quality. - LSMO

            Line smoothing option. Value can be ON or OFF.  If Value = ON, smoothing of nodes on area boundaries is performed during smoothing step of meshing.  During smoothing, node locations are adjusted to achieve a better mesh.  If Value = OFF (default), no smoothing takes place at area boundaries. - CLEAR

            This option affects the element and node numbering after clearing a mesh.  If Value = ON (default), the starting node and element numbers will be the lowest available number after the nodes and elements are cleared.  If Value = OFF, the  starting node and element numbers are not reset after the clear operation. - PYRA

        APDL Command: SFBEAM

        Specifies surface loads on beam and pipe elements.

        Parameters
        ----------
        elem
            Element to which surface load is applied.  If ALL, apply load to
            all selected beam elements (ESEL).  If Elem = P, graphical picking
            is enabled and all remaining command fields are ignored (valid only
            in the GUI).  A component name may be substituted in Elem.

        lkey
            Load key associated with surface load (defaults to 1).  Load keys
            (1, 2, 3, etc.) are listed under "Surface Loads" in the input table
            for each element type in the Element Reference.  For beam and some
            pipe elements, the load key defines the load orientation.

        lab
            Valid surface load label.  Load labels are listed under "Surface
            Loads" in the input table for each element type in the Element
            Reference.  Structural labels:  PRES (pressure).

        vali, valj
            Surface load values at nodes I and J.  If VALJ is blank, it
            defaults to VALI.  If VALJ is zero, a zero is used.

        val2i, val2j
            Second surface load values at nodes I and J.  Currently not used.

        ioffst, joffst
            Offset distance from node I (toward node J) where VALI is applied,
            and offset distance from node J (toward node I) where VALJ is
            applied, respectively.

        lenrat
            Offset distance flag:

            0  - Offset is in terms of length units (default).

            1  - Offset is in terms of a length ratio (0.0 to 1.0).

        Notes
        -----
        Specifies surface loads on the selected beam elements. Distributed
        loads are applied on a force-per-length basis (that is, the width of
        the underlying element is not considered). To list and delete surface
        loads applied with this command, use the SFELIST and SFEDELE commands,
        respectively.

        If no offset values (IOFFSET and JOFFSET) are specified, the load is
        applied over the full element length. Values may also be input as
        length fractions, depending on the LENRAT setting. For example,
        assuming a line length of 5.0, an IOFFST of 2.0 with LENRAT = 0 or an
        IOFFST of 0.4 with LENRAT = 1 represent the same point.  If JOFFST =
        -1, VALI is assumed to be a point load at the location specified via
        IOFFST, and VALJ is ignored. (IOFFSET cannot be equal to -1.) The
        offset values are stepped even if you issue a KBC,0 command.

        Offsets are only available for element types BEAM188 and PIPE288 if
        using the cubic shape function (KEYOPT(3) = 3) for those element types.

        To accumulate (add) surface loads applied with this command, use the
        SFCUM,,ADD command. Use the same offset values used on the previous
        SFBEAM command (for a given element face); otherwise, the loads do not
        accumulate. If no offsets are specified, the command applies the
        previous offset values.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.
