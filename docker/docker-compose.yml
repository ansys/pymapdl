# This is a docker-compose file which launch a remote MAPDL instance in a dockerized environment.
# You can connect to this instance throught the port 50052 and 50055 (for the database feature).
#
# For the license, you need to provide the hostname of the license server.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# =============
#
# - docker
# - docker images from ghcr.io (you might need to do 'docker login ghcr.io' first)
#
# USAGE:
# ======
#
# 1. You need two environment variables. One called ``DOCKER_IMAGE`` which contains the path to the
# docker image, and another one called ``ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE`` which points to the license server.
# For example:
#
#     export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1055@mylicensehost
#     export DOCKER_IMAGE=myregistry.com/myimage:mytag
# 
# 2. Run the following command:
# 
#     docker-compose up
#
# Optionally you can specify the '-d' flag for detaching mode (the container will run in the background).
#
#
# NOTES:
# ======
#
# - 'AWP_ROOT222' is where Ansys is installed.
# - The entrypoint must be defined in the docker image.
# - If you want to mount the local directory, please add the 'volumes' section to the 'mapdl' service.
# 
#      volumes:
#        - ./:/local
#
