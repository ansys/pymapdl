version: '3.3'

# This is a docker-compose file that will run Ansys MAPDL and DPF in a container.
# You can connect to this instance through port 50052 and 50055 (for the database feature).
#
# For the license, you need to provide the hostname of the license server.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# =============
#
# - Docker
# - Docker images from ghcr.io (you might need to do 'docker login ghcr.io' first)
#
# USAGE - MAPDL
# ============
#
# 1. You need two environment variables. One called `DOCKER_IMAGE` which contains the path to the
# Docker image, and another one called `ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` which points to the license server.
# For example:
#
#     export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1055@mylicensehost
#     export DOCKER_IMAGE=myregistry.com/myimage:mytag
# 
# 2. Run the following command:
# 
#     docker-compose up -d mapdl
#
# Optionally, you can specify the '-d' flag for detached mode (the container will run in the background).
#

# USAGE - DPF
# ===========

# 1. You need to have the 'DPF_DOCKER_IMAGE' environment variable set. For example:
#
#        export DPF_DOCKER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ansys/dpf-core:22.2dev
#
# as well as the `ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` env var.
# 2. Run the following command:
#
#     docker-compose up -d dpf
#
# Optionally, you can specify the '-d' flag for detached mode (the container will run in the background).
#
#
# USAGE - MAPDL LOCAL
# ===================
# It is said to be running as 'local' because it will mount the current directory in '/local' 
# inside the container (presumably you will have the cloned repository in the current directory),
# and it will override the entrypoint to run the 'bash' command.
#
# 1. You need to have the 'mapdl' service running. You can do this by running the command:
#  
#      docker-compose up -d mapdl
#
# 2. Once you have done this, you can start the service by running:
#
#      docker-compose -f d mapdl-local
#
# 3. you can run together by `
#     docker-compose -up -d mapdl mapdl-local
#
# NOTES
# =====
#
# - If you need to run a license server, please have a look at 'docker-compose.license_server.yml'
# file. In that case, the command to launch everything is:
# 
#      docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.license-server.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up
#
# NOTES:
# ======
#
# - `AWP_ROOT222` is where Ansys is installed.
# - The entrypoint must be defined in the Docker image.
# - If you want to mount the local directory, please add the 'volumes' section to the 'mapdl' service.
# 
#      volumes:
#        - ./:/local
#
