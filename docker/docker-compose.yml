# This is a docker-compose file that will run Ansys MAPDL, and optionally DPF, in a container.
# You can connect to this instance through port 50052 and 50055 (for the MAPDL database feature).
# DPF server can be connected to using the port 50056.
#
# For the license, you need to provide the hostname of the license server using ``ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE``
# environment variable.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# =============
#
# - Docker
# - MAPDL docker images
# - (Optional) DPF docker images
#
# USAGE
# =====
#
# 1. You need two environment variables. One called `DOCKER_IMAGE` which contains the path to the
# Docker image, and another one called `ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE` which points to the license server.
# For example:
#
#    .. code:: bash
# 
#       export ANSYSLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1055@mylicenseserver
#       export DOCKER_IMAGE=myregistry.com/myimage:mytag
#       export DPF_DOCKER_IMAGE=myregistry.com/mydpfimage:mydpftag # optional
#
#    Additionally you can also configure the following environment variables:
# 
#    - ``AWP_ROOT``: Set the environment variable ``AWP_ROOTXXX`` where XXX is the MAPDL version.
#      For instance, MAPDL 2025R1 is 251.
#    - ``AWP_ROOT_VALUE``: Set the value of the ``AWP_ROOTXXX`` environment variable, which normally points
#      to the MAPDL installation directory.
#    - ``DOCKER_USER``: It should match the username inside the container. You can obtain this value by executing
#      ``echo $USER`` in a terminal inside the container.
# 
# 2. Run the following command from the ``docker`` directory.
# 
#    .. code:: bash
# 
#       cd docker
#       docker-compose up -d %service_name%
#
# This docker-compose file contains three services:
#
# - ``mapdl``: Core service. It runs an MAPDL instance with the gRPC server activated, and it open the
#   specified port to allow incoming connections to it.
# - ``dpf``: DPF service which can be used for data processing.
# - ``mapdl-local``: Use this service to start an ubuntu docker image with MAPDL installed in it.
#   It is said to be running as 'local' because it will mount the parent directory (``../``) in '/home/mapdl/pymapdl' 
#   This service allow VS Code to attach to it and do development inside the container.
#   and it will override the entrypoint to run the 'bash' command.
#
# You can also specify multiple services:
#
#    .. code:: bash
# 
#       docker-compose up -d mapdl dpf
#
# Or use profiles:
#
# 
#    .. code:: bash
# 
#       docker-compose --profile dpf up -d 
#
# The following profiles are are available:
#
# - ``mapdl`` - Equivalent to run ``docker-compose up -d mapdl``.
# - ``mapdl-dpf`` - Equivalent to run ``docker-compose up -d mapdl dpf``.
# - ``local`` - Equivalent to run ``docker-compose up -d mapdl-local``.
# - ``local-dpf`` -  Equivalent to run ``docker-compose up -d mapdl-local dpf``.
# - ``dpf`` -  Equivalent to run ``docker-compose up -d dpf``.
#
# Optionally, you can specify the '-d' flag for detached mode (the container will run in the background).
#
# NOTES
# =====
#
# - ``AWP_ROOT251`` is where Ansys 2025 R1 (v251) is installed.
