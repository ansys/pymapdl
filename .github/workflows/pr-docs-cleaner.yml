# This action cleans up the deployed documentation for pull requests
# after they have been merged or closed.
# The docs deployment is implemented in the main CICD file (`ci.yml`)
# since it is in that workflow where the docs are built.
# 
# For more information see:
# https://actions.docs.ansys.com/version/stable/doc-actions/index.html#doc-deploy-pr-action
