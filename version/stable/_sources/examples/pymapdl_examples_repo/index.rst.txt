PyMAPDL examples repository
===========================


The Verification Manual examples and the Technology Showcase examples
are hosted in the  `PyMAPDL Examples repository <pymapdl_ex_repo_>`_.

The documentation to these examples can be found in the
`PyMAPDL Examples documentation <pymapdl_ex_doc_>`_.

.. === VERIFICATION MANUAL EXAMPLES ===

Verification manual examples
----------------------------

The Verification Manual examples demonstrate a range of Mechanical APDL
elements and capabilities in straightforward problems which have
"classical" or readily obtainable theoretical solutions using PyMAPDL.

These problems may then serve as the basis for additional validation
and qualification of Mechanical APDL capabilities for specific
applications that may be of interest.

The documentation to these examples can be found in the
`Verification Manual <pymapdl_ex_vm_>`_ section.


.. === TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE EXAMPLES ===

Technology showcase examples
----------------------------

The PyMAPDL technology showcase examples are more complex test cases than
the ones preceding. They demonstrate how to use PyMAPDL to effectively
and accurately solve interdisciplinary problems from a variety of industries
and engineering fields.

The examples initially come from the `APDL Technology Showcase Manual
<ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_ and are modeled with MAPDL files. Some of them have been
reproduced in Python files using PyMAPDL with the ``ansys-mapdl-core``
library.

The documentation to these examples can be found in the
`Technology Showcases <pymapdl_ex_ts_>`_ section.
