=========================================================


üõë Disclaimer
=============

**You must use this Codespace only for developing, contributing, documenting, and
writing examples for PyMAPDL**.

Additionally, this Codespace is using an MAPDL Student version. For information on how Ansys
supports your learning Ansys software, see the
`Ansys for Students <https://www.ansys.com/academic/students>`_ page on the Ansys website.
The Ansys Student version has some limitations. For more information, see the
`Ansys Student - Free Software Download <https://www.ansys.com/academic/students/ansys-student>`_
page on the Ansys website.


üìñ Codespace configuration
==========================

This Codespace has been set for helping developers to document and write examples
in PyMAPDL in the easiest way. It contains all the OS and Python dependencies
for running PyMAPDL and building the documentation in HTML and PDF.

Some of the available Python dependencies are:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* PyVista
* Sphinx
* Plotly


üßê How to
==========

Before you start documenting PyMAPDL, see
`Write documentation <https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/version/dev/getting_started/write_documentation.html>`_,
which describes the necessary steps.

You can see the latest documentation on using Codespaces with PyMAPDL in
`Develop on containers <https://mapdl.docs.pyansys.com/version/dev/getting_started/devcontainer_link.html>`_.

**Extra bonus**

If you want to see the built html pages, you can run a web server from the Codespace,
and access it from your local browser.
To do so...
See `Forwarding ports in your codespace <https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace>`_ for more information.

üòä Finally
==========

We hope you enjoy this Codespace. 


**Happy coding! üíª**
