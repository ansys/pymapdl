.. === TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE EXAMPLES ===

Technology showcase examples
============================

The PyMAPDL technology showcase examples are more complex test cases than
the ones presented above. They demonstrate how to use PyMAPDL to effectively
and accurately solve interdisciplinary problems from a variety of industries
and engineering fields.

The examples initially come from the `APDL Technology Showcase Manual
<tech_demo_intro_>`_ and are modeled with MAPDL files. Some of them have been
reproduced in Python files using PyMAPDL with the ``ansys-mapdl-core``
library.

The examples are hosted in the  `PyMAPDL Techdemos repository <tech_demo_repo_>`_.

The documentation to the exposed examples can be found in the
`PyMAPDL Techdemos documentation <tech_demos_doc_>`_.

Download example files
======================

Each example should contain all the necessary resources to run the example.
However in some cases, external files are needed. A link to those files is
available at each example page.
These links refers to the following GitHub repository where you can find all of them:

`GitHub Example Data Repository <example_data_repo_>`_

If you find a missing or broken link, open an issue in
GitHub (`PyMAPDL Issues <pymapdl_issues_>`_) 
or send an email to `PyAnsys Support <pyansys_support_>`_.
