Download example files
======================

Each example should contain all the necessary resources to run the example.
However in some cases, external files are needed. A link to those files is
available at each example page.
These links refers to the following GitHub repository where you can find all of them:

`GitHub Example Data Repository <example_data_repo_>`_

If you find a missing or broken link, open an issue in
GitHub (`PyMAPDL Issues <pymapdl_issues_>`_)
or send an email to `PyAnsys Core team <pyansys_core_>`_.
