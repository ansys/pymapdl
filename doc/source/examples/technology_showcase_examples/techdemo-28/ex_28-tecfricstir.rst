Friction Stir Welding (FSW) Simulation
***************************************

This example problem shows how to simulate the friction stir welding (FSW)
process.  Several characteristics of FSW are presented, including
tool-workpiece surface interaction, heat generation due to friction, and
plastic deformation. A nonlinear direct coupled-field analysis is performed, as
thermal and mechanical behaviors are mutually dependent and coupled together
during the FSW process.

Because it is often difficult to find a full set of engineering data to
simulate the FSW process, the problem emphasizes the simulation rather than the
numerical results. A simplified version of the model created by Zhu and Chao
illustrates the FSW simulation method.

The following features and capabilities are highlighted:

* Direct Structural-thermal analysis using coupled-field solid elements
* Plastic heat generation in coupled-field elements
* Frictional heat generation using contact elements
* Surface-projection-based contact   method
* Contact elements with bonding capability

28.1. Introduction
------------------

Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding technique that involves
the joining of metals without filler materials. A cylindrical rotating tool
plunges into a rigidly clamped workpiece and moves along the joint to be
welded. As the tool translates along the joint, heat is generated by friction
between the tool shoulder and the workpiece. Additional heat is generated by
plastic deformation of the workpiece material. The generated heat results in
thermal softening of the workpiece material. The translation of the tool causes
the softened workpiece material to flow from the front to the back of the tool
where it consolidates. As cooling occurs, a solid continuous joint between the
two plates is formed. No melting occurs during the process, and the resulting
temperature remains below the solidus temperature of the metals being joined.
FSW offers many advantages over conventional welding techniques, and has been
successfully applied in the aerospace, automobile, and shipbuilding industries.

Thermal and mechanical behaviors are mutually dependent during the FSW process.
Because the temperature field affects stress distribution, this example uses a
fully thermomechanically coupled model. The model consists of a coupled-field
solid element with structural and thermal degrees of freedom. The model has two
rectangular steel plates and a cylindrical tool. All necessary mechanical and
thermal `28.5. Boundary Conditions and Loading`_ are applied on the model.  The
simulation occurs over three load steps, representing the `28.5.3. Loading`_ of
the process.

The temperature rises at the contact interface due to frictional contact
between the tool and workpiece. FSW generally occurs when the temperature at
the weld line region reaches 70 to 90 percent of the melting temperature of the
workpiece material.  The temperature obtained around the weld line region in
this example falls within the range reported by Zhu and Chao [Zhu2004]_ and
Prasanna and Rao [Prasanna2010]_, while the maximum resulting temperature is
well below the melting temperature of the workpiece.

The calculated frictional heat generation and plastic heat generation show that
the friction between the tool shoulder and workpiece is responsible for
generating most of the heat. A bonding temperature is specified at the contact
interface of the plates to model the welding behind the tool. When the
temperature at the contact surface exceeds this bonding temperature, the
contact is changed to bonded.

28.2. Problem Description
-------------------------

**The Zhu and Chao Thermomechanical Model**

The model used in this example is a simplified version of the thermomechanical
model developed by Zhu and Chao for FSW with 304L stainless steel [Zhu2004]_.
Zhu and Chao presented nonlinear thermal and thermomechanical simulations using
the finite element analysis code `WELDSIM`. They initially formulated a
heat-transfer problem using a moving heat source, and later used the transient
temperature outputs from the thermal analysis to determine residual stresses in
the welded plates via a 3-D elastoplastic thermomechanical simulation.

A direct coupled-field analysis is performed on a reduced-scale version of the
Zhu and Chao model [Zhu2004]_. Also, rather than using a moving heat source as
in the reference model, a rotating and moving tool is used for a more realistic
simulation.

The tool pin is ignored. The heat generated at the pin represents approximately
two percent of the total heat and is therefore negligible.

The simulation welds two 304L stainless steel plates (workpiece) with a
cylindrical shape tool, as shown in the following figure:

**Figure 28.1: 3-D Model of Workpiece and Tool**

The FSW process generally requires a tool made of a harder material than the
workpiece material being welded. In the past, FSW was used for soft workpiece
materials such as aluminium. With the development of tools made from
super-abrasive materials such as polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN),
FSW has become possible with high-temperature materials such as stainless
steel. A cylindrical PCBN tool is modeled in this case.

The workpiece sides parallel to the weld line are constrained in all the
directions to simulate the clamping ends. The bottom side of the workpiece is
constrained in the perpendicular (z) direction to simulate support at the
bottom. Heat losses are considered on all the surfaces of the model. All
`28.5. Boundary Conditions and Loading`_ are symmetric across the weld
centerline.

The simulation is performed in three load steps, each representing a respective
phase ( `28.5.3. Loading`_) of the FSW process.

28.3. Modeling
--------------

Modeling is a two-part task, as described in these topics:

*  `28.3.1. Workpiece and Tool Modeling`_
*  `28.3.2. Contact Modeling`_

28.3.1. Workpiece and Tool Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two rectangular shaped plates (similar to those used in the reference model)
are used as the workpiece. Dimensions have been reduced to decrease the
simulation time.

The plate size is 3 x 1.25 x 0.125 in (76.2 x 31.75 x 3.18 mm). The tool
shoulder diameter is 0.6 in (15.24 mm).

Plate thickness remains the same as that of the reference model, but the plate
length and width are reduced. The plate width is reduced because the regions
away from the weld line are not significantly affected by the welding process,
and this example focuses primarily on the heat generation and temperature rise
in the region nearest the weld line.

The height of the tool is equal to the shoulder diameter. Both the workpiece
(steel plates) and the tool are modeled using coupled-field element
``SOLID226`` with the structural-thermal option (``KEYOPT(1)= 11``).

A hexahedral mesh with dropped midside nodes is used because the presence of
midside nodes (or quadratic interpolation functions) can lead to oscillations
in the thermal solution, leading to nonphysical temperature distribution. A
hexahedral mesh is used instead of a tetrahedral mesh to avoid mesh-orientation
dependency. For more accurate results, a finer mesh is used in the weld-line
region. The following figure shows the 3-D meshed model:

28.3.2. Contact Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contact is modeled as follows for the FSW simulation:

* Contact Pair Between the Plates
* Contact Pair Between Tool and Workpiece
* Rigid Surface Constraint


28.3.2.1. Contact Pair Between the Plates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the simulation, the surfaces to be joined come into contact. A standard
surface-to-surface contact pair using ``TARGE170`` and ``CONTA174``, as shown
in the following figure:

.. figure:: graphics/gtecfricstir_fig3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Contact Pair Between Plates
    :figclass: align-center
    
    **Figure 28.3: Contact Pair Between Plates**

The surface-projection-based contact method (``KEYOPT(4) = 3`` for contact
elements) is defined at the contact interface. The surface-projection-based
contact method is well suited to highly nonlinear problems that include
geometrical, material, and contact nonlinearities.

The problem simulates welding using the bonding capability of contact
elements. To achieve continuous bonding and simulate a perfect thermal contact
between the plates, a high thermal contact conductance (TCC) of 2 ⋅ 10E6 W/m2
°C is specified. (A small TCC value yields an imperfect contact and a
temperature discontinuity across the interface.) The conductance is specified
as a real constant for ``CONTA174`` elements.

The maximum temperature ranges from 70 to 90 percent of the melting temperature
of the workpiece material. Welding occurs after the temperature of the material
around the contacting surfaces exceeds the bonding temperature (approximately
70 percent of the workpiece melting temperature). In this case, 1000 °C is
considered to be the bonding temperature based on the reference results. The
bonding temperature is specified using the real constant ``TBND`` for
``CONTA174``. When the temperature at the contact surface for closed contact
exceeds the bonding temperature, the contact type changes to bonded. The
contact status remains bonded for the remainder of the simulation, even though
the temperature subsequently decreases below the bonding value.

28.3.2.2. Contact Pair Between Tool and Workpiece
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool plunges into the work piece, rotates, and moves along the weld line.
Because the frictional contact between the tool and workpiece is primarily
responsible for heat generation, a standard surface-to-surface contact pair is
defined between the tool and workpiece. The ``CONTA174`` element is used to
model the contact surface on the top surface of the workpiece, and the
``TARGE170`` element is used for the tool, as shown in this figure:

.. jupyter-execute:: 
    :hide-code:
    
    mapdl.allsel("all")

    # Plotting geometry
    p = pyvista.Plotter()
    p.background_color='white'
    for elem, color in zip((170, 174),('red', 'blue')):
        mapdl.esel("s", "ename","", elem)
        esurf = mapdl.mesh._grid.linear_copy().extract_surface().clean()
        p.add_mesh(esurf, 
                    show_edges=True, 
                    show_scalar_bar=False, 
                    style='surface', 
                    color=color)
    
    p.show()

**Figure 28.4: Contact Pair Between Tool and Workpiece.**
``CONTA174`` in blue, and ``TARGE170`` in red.


Two real constants are specified to model friction-induced heat generation.
The fraction of frictional dissipated energy converted into heat is modeled
first; the ``FHTG`` real constant is set to 1 to convert all frictional
dissipated energy into heat. The factor for the distribution of heat between
contact and target surfaces is defined next; the ``FWGT`` real constant is set
to 0.95, so that 95 percent of the heat generated from the friction flows into
the workpiece and only five percent flows into the tool.

A low TCC value (10 W/m2 °C) is specified for this contact pair because most of
the heat generated transfers to the workpiece.  Some additional heat is also
generated by plastic deformation of the workpiece material. Because the
workpiece material softens and the value of friction coefficient drops as the
temperature increases, a variable coefficient of friction (0.4 to 0.2) is
defined (:meth:`Mapdl.tb("FRIC") <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.tb>` with
:meth:`mapdl.tbtemp() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.tbtemp>` and
:meth:`Mapdl.tbdata() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.tbdata>`).

28.3.2.3. Rigid Surface Constraint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workpiece remains fixed in all stages of the simulation. The tool rotates
and moves along the weld line. A pilot node is created at the center of the top
surface of the tool in order to apply the rotation and translation on the tool.
The motion of the pilot node controls the motion of the entire tool. A rigid
surface constraint is defined between the pilot node (``TARGE170``) and the
nodes of the top surface of the tool (``CONTA174``). A multipoint constraint
(MPC) algorithm with contact surface behavior defined as bonded always is used
to constrain the contact nodes to the rigid body motion defined by the pilot
node.

The following contact settings are used for the ``CONTA174`` elements:

* To include MPC contact algorithm: ``KEYOPT(2) = 2``
* For a rigid surface constraint: ``KEYOPT(4) = 2``
* To set the behavior of contact surface as bonded (always): ``KEYOPT(12) = 5``

28.4. Material Properties
-------------------------

Accurate temperature calculation is critical to the FSW process because the
stresses and strains developed in the weld are temperature-dependent. Thermal
properties of the 304L steel plates such as thermal conductivity, specific
heat, and density are temperature-dependent. Mechanical properties of the
plates such as Young's modulus and the coefficient of thermal expansion are
considered to be constant due to the limitations of data available in the
literature.

It is assumed that the plastic deformation of the material uses the von Misses
yield criterion, as well as the associated flow rule and the work-hardening
rule. Therefore, a bilinear isotropic hardening model (``TB,PLASTIC,,,,BISO``)
is selected.

The following table shows the material properties of the workpiece:

:meth:`Mapdl.tbdata() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.tbdata>` defines the yield stress and tangent modulus.

The fraction of the plastic work dissipated as heat during FSW is about 80
percent. Therefore, the fraction of plastic work converted to heat
(Taylor-Quinney coefficient) is set to 0.8 (:meth:`Mapdl.mp("QRATE")
<ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.mp>`) for the calculation of plastic heat generation in
the workpiece material.

To weld a high-temperature material such as 304L stainless steel, a tool
composed of hard material is required. Tools made from super-abrasive materials
such as PCBN are suitable for such processes, and so a cylindrical PCBN tool is
used here. The material properties of the PCBN tool are obtained from the
references: [Ozel2008]_ and [Mishra2007]_.


The following table shows the material properties of the PCBN tool:

28.5. Boundary Conditions and Loading
-------------------------------------

This section describes the thermal and mechanical boundary conditions imposed
on the FSW model:

*  `28.5.1. Thermal Boundary Conditions`_

*  `28.5.3. Loading`_

28.5.1. Thermal Boundary Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The frictional and plastic heat generated during the FSW process propagates
rapidly into remote regions of the plates. On the top and side surfaces of the
workpiece, convection and radiation account for heat loss to the
ambient. Conduction losses also occur from the bottom surface of the workpiece
to the backing plate.

    pl.show()

**Figure 28.6: Thermal Boundary Conditions.**
Convection loads (red) and conduction loads (yellow)

Available data suggest that the value of the convection coefficient lies
between 10 and 30 W/m2 °C for the workpiece surfaces, except for the bottom
surface. The value of the convection coefficient is 30 W/m2°C for workpiece and
tool. This coefficient affects the output temperature. A lower coefficient
increases the output temperature of the model. A high overall heat-transfer
coefficient (about 10 times the convective coefficient) of 300 W/m2 °C is
assumed for the conductive heat loss through the bottom surface of the
workpiece. As a result, the bottom surface of the workpiece is also treated as
a convection surface for modeling conduction losses. Because the percentage of
heat lost due to radiation is low, radiation heat losses are ignored. An
initial temperature of 25 °C is applied on the model. Temperature boundary
conditions are not imposed anywhere on the model.

28.5.2. Mechanical Boundary Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The workpiece is fixed by clamping each plate. The clamped portions of the
plates are constrained in all directions.  To simulate support at the bottom of
the plates, all bottom nodes of the workpiece are constrained in the
perpendicular direction (z direction).

    mapdl.d("all", "uz")  # Displacement constraint in z-direction
    mapdl.allsel("all")



28.5.3. Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FSW process consists of three primary phases:

1. **Plunge** -- The tool plunges slowly into the workpiece
   
2. **Dwell** -- Friction between the rotating tool and workpiece generates heat
   at the initial tool position until the workpiece temperature reaches the
   value required for the welding.
3. **Traverse (or Traveling)** -- The rotating tool moves along the weld line.
   
During the traverse phase, the temperature at the weld line region rises, but
the maximum temperature values do not surpass the melting temperature of the
workpiece material. As the temperature drops, a solid continuous joint appears
between the two plates.

For illustrative purposes, each phase of the FSW process is considered a separate
load step. A rigid surface constraint is already defined for applying loading on the
tool. 

The following table shows the details for each load step.

**Table 28.3: Load Steps**

+-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Load Step | Time Period (sec)| Loadings on Pilot Node                                                     | Boundary Condition                    |
+===========+==================+============================================================================+=======================================+
| 1         | 1                | Displacement boundary condition                                            | ``UZ`` = -7.95E-07 m                  |

+-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| 3         | 22.5             | Displacement and rotational boundary conditions together on the pilot node | ``ROTZ`` = 60 RPM ``UY`` = 60.96E-3 m |
+-----------+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+


The tool plunges into the workpiece at a very shallow depth, then rotates to
generate heat. The depth and rotating speeds are the critical parameters for
the weld temperatures. The parameters are determined based on the experimental
data of Zhu and Chao [Zhu2004]_. The tool travels from one end of the welding
line to the other at a speed of 2.7 mm/s.

28.6. Analysis and Solution Controls
------------------------------------

A nonlinear transient analysis is performed in three load steps using
structural-thermal options of ``SOLID226`` and
``CONTA174``. 

FSW simulation includes factors such as nonlinearity, contact, friction, large
plastic deformation, structural-thermal coupling, and different loadings at
each load step. The solution settings applied consider all of these factors.

The first load step in the solution process converges within a few substeps,
but the second and third load steps converge only after applying the proper
solution settings shown in the following table:

To allow for a faster solution, automatic time-stepping is activated
(:meth:`Mapdl.autots("on") <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.autots>`). The initial time
step size (:meth:`Mapdl.deltim() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.deltim>`) is set to
0.1, and the minimum time step is set to 0.001. The maximum time step is set as
0.2 in load steps 2 and 3.  A higher maximum time-step size may result in an
unconverged solution.

The time step values are determined based on mesh or element size. For
stability, no time-step limitation exists for the implicit integration
algorithm. Because this problem is inherently nonlinear and an accurate
solution is necessary, a disturbance must not propagate to more than one
element in a time step; therefore, an upper limit on the time step size is
required. It is important to choose a time step size that does not violate the
subsequent criterion (minimum element size, maximum thermal conductivity over
the whole model, minimum density, and minimum specific heat).

28.7. Results and Discussion

The following results topics for the FSW simulation are available:

*  `28.7.1. Deformation and Stresses`_
*  `28.7.2. Temperature Results`_ 
*  `28.7.3. Welding Results`_
*  `28.7.4. Heat Generation`_



28.7.1. Deformation and Stresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is important to observe the change in various quantities around the weld
line during the FSW process. The following figure shows the deflection of the
workpiece due to plunging of the tool in the first load step:

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.9.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 


**Figure 28.9: Deflection at Workpiece After Load Step 1**


The deflection causes high stresses to develop on the workpiece beneath the
tool, as shown in this figure:

    
.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.10.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 

**Figure 28.10: von Mises Stress After Load Step 1**

Following load step 1, the temperature remains unchanged (25 °C), as shown in
this figure:
    
.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.11.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 


**Figure 28.11: Temperature After Load Step 1**

As the tool begins to rotate at this location, the frictional stresses develop
and increase rapidly. The following two figures show the increment in contact
frictional stresses from load step 1 to load step 2:

    
.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.12.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 


**Figure 28.12: Frictional Stress After Load Step 1**


.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.13.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 


**Figure 28.13: Frictional Stress After Load Step 2**

All frictional dissipated energy is converted into heat during load step 2. The
heat is generated at the tool-workpiece interface. Most of the heat is
transferred to the workpiece (FWGT is specified to 0.95). As a result, the
temperature of the workpiece increases rapidly compared to that of the tool.

28.7.2. Temperature Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following two figures shows the temperature rise due to heat generation in the
second and third load steps:

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.14.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 

**Figure 28.14: Temperature After Load Step 2**


.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:

   rotor1 = pyvista.read(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files",'Figure_28.15.vtk'))
   pl = pyvista.Plotter()
   pl.add_mesh(rotor1, scalars="values", cmap='jet', show_edges=True)
   pl.show() 

**Figure 28.15: Temperature After Load Step 3**


The maximum temperature on the workpiece occurs beneath the tool during the
last two load steps. Heat generation is due to the mechanical loads. No
external heat sources are used. As the temperature increases, the material
softens and the coefficient of friction decreases. A temperature-dependent
coefficient of friction (0.4 to 0.2) helps to prevent the maximum temperature
from exceeding the material melting point.

The observed temperature rise in the model shows that heat generation during
the second and third load steps is due to friction between the tool shoulder
and workpiece, as well as plastic deformation of the workpiece material.

The melting temperature of 304L stainless steel is 1450 °C. As shown in the
following figure, the maximum temperature range at the weld line region on the
workpiece beneath the tool is well below the melting temperature of the
workpiece material during the second and third load steps, but above 70 percent
of the melting temperature:

the workpiece along the transverse distance (perpendicular to the weld line):

   pl.camera.position=(0,0.15,0)
   pl.show() 

**Figure 28.19: Temperature Distribution in Thickness Direction at Location 1**


As expected, the highest temperature caused by heat generation appears around
the weld line region. By comparing the above temperature results with the
reference results, it can be determined that the temperatures obtained at the
weld line are well below the melting temperature of the workpiece material, but
still sufficient for friction stir welding.

The following table and figure show the time-history response of the
temperature at various locations on the weld line:

28.7.4. Heat Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Friction and plastic deformation generate heat. A calculation of frictional and
plastic heat generation is performed. The generation of heat due to friction
begins in the second load step.

The ``CONTA174`` element's ``FDDIS`` (``SMISC item``) output option is used to
calculate frictional heat generation on the workpiece. This option gives the
frictional energy dissipation per unit area for an element. After multiplying
this value with the corresponding element area, the friction heat-generation
rate for an element is calculated. By summing the values from each ``CONTA174``
element of the workpiece, the total frictional heat generation rate is
calculated for a given time.

It is possible to calculate the total frictional heat-generation rate at each
time-step (:meth:`Mapdl.etable <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.etable>`).  The
following figure shows the plot of total frictional heat generation rate on the
workpiece with time:

.. jupyter-execute::
   :hide-code:
   
   columns_names = ['time', 'fricheat']
   values = np.loadtxt(download_tech_demo_data("td-28/supporting_files","Figure_28.23.txt"))
   
   df = pd.DataFrame(data=values, columns=columns_names)
   
   fig = go.Figure(
       [
           go.Scatter(x=df['time'], y=df['fricheat'], #name='Location 1 (0.018 m)',

                       line=dict(color='blue', width=3),
                       showlegend=False
                       ),
       ]
   )
   
   fig.update_layout(
       showlegend=True,
       template='simple_white',
       xaxis_title='<b>Time (Sec)</b>',
       yaxis_title='<b>Total frictional heat generation rate (W)</b>',
       title='<b>Total Frictional Heat Rate Variation with Time</b>',
       title_x=0.5,
       #legend_title='Locations',
       hovermode='x',

       yaxis=dict(showgrid=True)
   )
   fig.show()
   
**Figure 28.23: Total Frictional Heat Rate Variation with Time**

The plot indicates that the frictional heat starts from the second load step
(after 1 second). 

The element contact area can be calculated using the
``CONTA174`` element ``CAREA`` (``NMISC, 58``) output
option.

    mapdl.set("last")
    nst = mapdl.get_value("nst", "active", "", "set", "nset")  # To get number of data sets on result file

    # Total frictional heat rate
    mapdl.esel("s", "real", "", 5)
    mapdl.esel("r", "ename", "", 174)  # Selecting the contact elements on Workpiece
    fht = np.zeros(nst)
    for i in range(1, nst):
        mapdl.set("", "", "", "", "", "", i)

        # area for an element, FDDIS
        mapdl.etable("fri", "smisc", 18)

        # Multiplying Fri. energy dissipation
        # per unit area with the area of
        # corresponding element
        mapdl.smult("frri", "fri", "are1") 
        mapdl.ssum()  # Summing up the Frictional heat rate

        # Total Frictional heat rate on
        # workpiece at a particular time
        frhi = mapdl.get('frhi', 'ssum',, 'item', 'frri') 
        fht(i) = frhi 
    
    mapdl.parsav("all")
    mapdl.allsel("all")
    mapdl.finish()

    mapdl.post26()
    mapdl.file("fsw", "rst")
    mapdl.numvar(200)
    mapdl.solu(191, "ncmit")  # Solution summary data per substep to be
    # stored for cumulative no. of iterations.
    mapdl.store("merge")  # Merge data from results file
    mapdl.filldata(191, "", "", "", 1, 1)
    mapdl.realvar(191, 191)
    mapdl.parres("new", "fsw", "parm")
    mapdl.vput("fht", 11, "", "", "fric_heat")
    mapdl.plvar(11)  # Plot of frictional heat rate against time 


A similar calculation is performed to check the heat generation from plastic
deformation on the workpiece. The ``SOLID226`` element's output option
``PHEAT`` (``NMISC, 5``) gives the plastic heat generation rate per unit
volume.  After multiplying this value with the corresponding element volume,
the plastic heat generation rate for an element is calculated. By summing the
values from each element (``SOLID226``) of the workpiece, the total plastic
heat generation rate is calculated for a particular time.

It is possible to calculate the total frictional heat generation rate at each
time-step (:meth:`Mapdl.etable <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.etable>`). The following
figure shows the plot of the total plastic heat-generation rate with time.

**Figure 28.23** and **Figure 28.24**
show that friction is responsible for generating most of the heat needed, while the
contribution of heat due to plastic deformation is less significant. Because the
tool-penetration is shallow and the tool pin is ignored, the plastic heat is small
compared to frictional heat.


28.8. Recommendations
---------------------

To perform a similar FSW analysis, consider the following hints and
recommendations:

* FSW is a coupled-field (structural-thermal) process. The temperature field
  affects the stress distribution during the entire process. Also, heat generated
  in structural deformation affects the temperature field. The direct method of
  coupling is recommended for such processes. This method involves just one
  analysis that uses a coupled-field element containing all necessary degrees of
  freedom. Direct coupling is advantageous when the coupled-field interaction
  involves strongly-coupled physics or is highly nonlinear.
* A nonlinear transient analysis is preferable for simulations where the
  objective is to study the transient temperature and transient heat
  transfer.
* The dynamic effects of different physics should be controlled. In this
  problem, for example, the dynamic effects of the structural degrees of freedom
  are disabled as they are unimportant.
* Separating the solution process into three load steps helps you to understand
  the physics and solve the problem.
* The contact between the two plates must be nearly perfect to maintain
  temperature continuity. For a perfect thermal contact, specify a high thermal
  contact conductance (TCC) coefficient between workpiece plates. A high
  coefficient results in temperature continuity across the interface.
* Because the problem is nonlinear, proper solution settings are required. Set
  the following analysis controls to the appropriate values to achieve the
  converged solution: :meth:`Mapdl.lnsrch() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.lnsrch>`,
  :meth:`Mapdl.cutcontrol() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.cutcontrol>`, 
  :meth:`Mapdl.kbc() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.kbc>`, 
  :meth:`Mapdl.neqit() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.neqit>`, 
  :meth:`Mapdl.nropt() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.nropt>`,
  and :meth:`Mapdl.autots() <ansys.mapdl.core.Mapdl.autots>`.
* Convergence at the second and third load steps is difficult to achieve. The
  depth of penetration of the tool on the workpiece (``UZ``), rotational speed of the
  tool (``ROTZ``), and time-step size play crucial roles in the convergence of the
  second load step. Use a very small time-step size if the rotational speed is
  higher than 60 RPM.
* A symmetric mesh (about the joint line) is preferred to capture the exact
  outputs and their effects on the workpiece. A hex mesh with dropped midside
  nodes is recommended for the workpiece as well as the tool. This approach helps
  to maintain symmetry and prevent the temperature from reaching negative values
  during the simulation.
* A minimum of two element layers is required in the thickness direction. A fine
  sweep mesh near the weld line yields more accurate results; however, too fine a
  mesh increases computational time. A fine mesh is unnecessary on the tool side.
  To minimize computational time, the tool can be considered to be rigid with no
  temperature degrees of freedom.
