Dynamic simulation of a printed circuit board assembly
------------------------------------------------------

This examples shows how to use PyMAPDL to import an existing FE model and to
run a modal and PSD analysis. PyDPF modules are also used for post-processing.

This example is inspired from the model and analysis defined in Chapter 20 of
the Mechanical APDL Technology Showcase Manual.

Additional Packages Used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ is used for plotting purposes.

Starting MAPDL as a service and importing an external model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The original FE model is given in the Ansys Mechanical APDL Technology
Showcase Manual.  The .cdb contains a FE model of a single circuit board. The
model is meshed with SOLID186, SHELL181 and BEAM188 elements. All components
of the PCB model is assigned with linear elastic isotropic materials. Bonded
and flexible surface-to-surface contact pairs are used to define the contact
between the IC packages and the circuit board.

Run modal analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A modal analysis is run using Block Lanzos.
Only 10 modes are extracted for the sake of run times, but using a higher
number of nodes is recommended (suggestion: 300 modes).

     The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver used by the Block Lanczos          
     eigensolver is currently running in the in-core memory mode.  This      
     memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to avoid using the  
     hard drive as much as possible, which most often results in the         
     fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if enough physical     
     memory is present to accommodate all of the solver data.

Post-processing the modal results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This sections illustrates different methods to post-process the results of the
modal analysis : PyMAPDL method, PyMAPDL result reader, PyDPF-Post
and PyDPF-Core. All methods lead to the same result and are just given as an
example of how each module can be used.
The methods using DPF modules are commented in the code due to CI/CD issues
but will run locally if uncommented.

Post-process PSD analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The response spectrum analysis is post-processed. First, the standard
MAPDL POST1 postprocessor is used. Then, the MAPDL time-history
POST26 postprocessor is used to generate the response power spectral
density.

.. note::
   The graph generated through POST26 is exported as a picture in the working
   directory. Finally, the results from POST26 are saved to Python variables
   to be plotted in the Python environment with the use of Matplotlib
   library.
