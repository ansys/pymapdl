File explorer overview
======================
A specific property under the ``Mapdl`` class is dedicated for XPL. It's
based on the APDL Math ``*XPL`` command and can be used to explore binary
files generated from APDL.

All APDL files are organized the same way, as a tree or records. For
example, a binary result file has the structure outlined in the
:ref:`ref_rst_structure` figure.

.. _ref_rst_structure:

You can find a detailed example of the APDL file explorer in
:ref:`ref_xpl_example`.

For more information, see :ref:`ref_xpl_api`.
