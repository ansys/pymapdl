High performance clusters (HPC)
===============================

In this page, an overview on how to use PyMAPDL in HPC cluster is presented.
At the moment, only SLURM scheduler is considered.
However, many of the assumptions for this scheduler might apply to other schedulers like PBS, SGE, LSF, ...


Introduction
============

High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are powerful systems designed to handle
computationally intensive tasks efficiently. SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource
Management) is one of the most widely used job schedulers in HPC environments. This
comprehensive guide aims to provide an in-depth understanding of job submission using
SLURM on HPC clusters.
