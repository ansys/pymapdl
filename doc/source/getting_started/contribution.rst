There are several ways to contribute to PyMAPDL. 

* `Answer discussions`_
* `Post issues`_
* :ref:`write_documentation`
* :ref:`developing_pymapdl`

Overall guidance on contributing to a PyAnsys library appears in the
`Contributing <dev_guide_contributing_>`_ topic
in the *PyAnsys Developer's Guide*. Ensure that you are thoroughly familiar
with it and the `Coding style <dev_guide_coding_style_>`_ before attempting to
contribute to PyMAPDL.
 

Answer discussions
==================

Answering discussions is an excellent way to contribute to PyMAPDL, and
it does not require any setup, just a GitHub account.
It is probably the first step towards becoming a full PyMAPDL developer, since it
helps you deepen your understanding of the project. Engaging in
discussions often requires a thorough grasp of the project's goals and
challenges.
Your contributions can help other users or contributors who
may be facing similar issues, making the repository more welcoming and
inclusive. By providing answers or solutions, you can directly contribute to the project's
success, maintain its health, and encourage a positive, open source ecosystem.

To discover how you can help, see the `PyMAPDL Discussions <pymapdl_discussions_>`_ page.


Post issues
===========

Posting issues in a repository is a valuable contribution that benefits you, the
repository, and PyMAPDL as a whole. It allows you to voice concerns, suggest
improvements, or report bugs, which can lead to a more robust and user-friendly
project. It also offers an opportunity for you to engage with the project's
community, learn from others, and gain experience in issue tracking and
collaboration. 
For the repository, issues serve as a structured way to track and
prioritize work, helping maintainers understand the needs of users and guide the
project's development. It's an excellent way to contribute because it enhances
the project's quality, fosters transparency, and encourages the collective
effort of the community to continuously improve and innovate.

Use the `PyMAPDL Issues <pymapdl_issues_>`_ page to submit questions, report bugs,
and request new features.
When possible, use these issue templates:

* **üêû Bug, problem, or error**: Fill a bug report here
* **üìñ Documentation issue**: Modifications to the documentation only
* **üéì Adding an example**: Proposing a new example for the library
* **üí° New feature**: Enhancements to the code
