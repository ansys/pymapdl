Learning PyMAPDL
================

Ansys has prepared multiple resources to help you to learn and use PyMAPDL.
You can access them from the website `Ansys Learning Resources <learning_resources_>`_.
In this page, you can find a summary of the available resources for MAPDL and PyMAPDL.




Downloads
===========

- You can try the Student Version of Ansys products in
  `Ansys Student Versions <ansys_student_version_>`_.
  These are versions valid during a year and with limited capabilities 
  regarding number of nodes, elements, etc.

- View and download :download:`PyMAPDL cheatsheet <Cheat_Sheet_PyMAPDL.pdf>` to help
  you to learn PyMAPDL.

- Visit :ref:`ref_examples` to learn how PyMAPDL can be
  used to solve different real problems.

Ansys help
==========

`Ansys Help <ansys_help_>`_ is the official Ansys website for
documentation, tutorials and videos.

An `MAPDL introductory tutorials guide <ansys_introductory_mapdl_courses_>`_ which
cover different topics such as
`Structural tutorial <ansys_introtut_structures_>`_
`Thermal tutorial <ansys_introtut_thermal_>`_
`Electromagnetics tutorial <ansys_introtut_electromag_>`_
`Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) tutorial <ansys_introtut_mems_>`_
`Contact tutorial <ansys_introtut_contact_>`_ or
`Modal tutorial <ansys_introtut_modal_>`_

You can find documentation such as the
`Command reference guide <ansys_command_reference_guide_>`_,
`Verification manual guide <ansys_verification_manual_>`_ or
`Technology showcase guide <ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_.

The `Technology showcase guide <ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_ is a comprehensive guide with 
real-world example problems which present the broad simulation
capabilities of Ansys Mechanical APDL.
The problems demonstrate how to use Mechanical APDL to effectively 
and accurately solve interdisciplinary problems from a variety of
industries and engineering fields.
The problems are more substantive and complex than examples found
in the standard documentation set. The documentation thoroughly
examines the physics involved with each problem and the considerations
necessary for translating problems into numerical models.
You can find some of the technology showcase examples in PyMAPDL documentation 
`Technology Showcases <pymapdl_ex_ts_>`. For a more comprehensive list of
showcases, visit `Technology showcase guide <ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_.
