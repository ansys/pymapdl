Introduction

.. centered:: _PyMAPDL provides Pythonic access to MAPDL, an Ansys finite element solver._

PyMAPDL touches on different technologies such as Python and finite elements, to bring them together
and offer you a better user experience by seamlessly connecting this Ansys solver and the Python ecosystem.
To learn how to use this library, you have many resources available:

* Complete the :ref:`ref_pymapdl_course` course, which guides you through PyMAPDL's
  main functionalities.
* Visit the `Examples gallery <pymapdl_examples_gallery_>`_ to learn from practical examples.
  The `Static analysis of a corner bracket <pymapdl_bracket_static_example_>`_ example is a very
  good starting point.
* Become familiar with the Python programming language. There are many online courses and
  websites for learning Python. Additionally, Ansys provides a :ref:`ref_python_course` course.
* Understand finite element methods (FEMs). Because physical models are solved using FEMs, you
  need to know how these methods work to get accurate and adequate solutions. The 
  `Introduction to Finite Element Methods <course_fem_track_>`_ course on the Ansys
  Learning Resources website offers tracks to help you to get familiar with these methods.
* Take the Ansys :ref:`ref_mapdl_course` course. Because PyMAPDL interface with MAPDL
  through APDL commands, you should become familiar with MAPDL commands and
  workflows.

Ansys help
==========

`Ansys Help <ansys_help_>`_ is the official Ansys website for
documentation, tutorials and videos.

An `MAPDL introductory tutorials guide <ansys_introductory_mapdl_courses_>`_ which
cover different topics such as
`Structural tutorial <ansys_introtut_structures_>`_
`Thermal tutorial <ansys_introtut_thermal_>`_
`Electromagnetics tutorial <ansys_introtut_electromag_>`_
`Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) tutorial <ansys_introtut_mems_>`_
`Contact tutorial <ansys_introtut_contact_>`_ or
`Modal tutorial <ansys_introtut_modal_>`_

You can find documentation such as the
`Command reference guide <ansys_command_reference_guide_>`_,
`Verification manual guide <ansys_verification_manual_>`_ or
`Technology showcase guide <ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_.

The `Technology showcase guide <ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_ is a comprehensive guide with 
real-world example problems which present the broad simulation
capabilities of Ansys Mechanical APDL.
The problems demonstrate how to use Mechanical APDL to effectively 
and accurately solve interdisciplinary problems from a variety of
industries and engineering fields.
The problems are more substantive and complex than examples found
in the standard documentation set. The documentation thoroughly
examines the physics involved with each problem and the considerations
necessary for translating problems into numerical models.
You can find some of the technology showcase examples in PyMAPDL documentation 
`Technology Showcases <pymapdl_ex_ts_>`. For a more comprehensive list of
showcases, visit `Technology showcase guide <ansys_techdemo_guide_>`_.

**NOTE**: You might need to create a free Ansys account to access these resources.
