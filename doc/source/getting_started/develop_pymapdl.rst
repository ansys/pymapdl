Develop code
============

You can help improve PyMAPDL by fixing a bug or developing a new feature.
To do either, you must set up the repository on your local machine as per the
explanations in the following sections.


Clone the PyMAPDL repository
============================

Before cloning the PyMAPDL repository, you must install a version control system such as Git.
You can this run this code to clone the latest development version of PyMAPDL:

.. code:: console

    git clone https://github.com/ansys/pymapdl
    cd pymapdl



Create a Python virtual environment
===================================

To avoid dependency conflicts and more easily manage upgrades, you should install PyMAPDL in its own virtual environment. For detailed information on how to install Python and create a virtual environment, see
`Setting up your development environment <dev_guide_setup_your_environment_>`_.

Install PyMAPDL in development mode
===================================

Install the latest version of PyMAPDL in development mode with these commands:


.. code:: console

    cd pymapdl
    pip install pip -U
    pip install -e .


If you are going to do testing, you must install the testing dependencies with this command:


.. code:: console

    pip install -e '.[tests]'


Develop PyMAPDL
===============

.. epigraph:: *Now it is time to develop PyMAPDL!*

Developing code in a repository, particularly when using version control systems
like Git, involves a set of essential guidelines to ensure efficient
collaboration, code management, and tracking changes. Here are the main
guidelines for developing code in a repository:

#. **Use branches**: Create branches for different features, bug fixes, or
   experiments. This keeps changes isolated and facilitates parallel
   development.

#. **Write descriptive commit messages**: Provide clear and concise commit
   messages that explain the purpose and context of the changes. Follow a
   consistent style.

#. **Commit frequently**: Make small, meaningful commits frequently. Avoid
   making a large number of unrelated changes in a single commit.

#. **Pull before you push**: Always update your local branch with the latest
   changes from the remote repository before pushing your own changes to avoid
   conflicts.

#. **Use pull requests (PRs)**: Use PRs to submit your changes for review.
   This allows for discussion and validation before merging into the main branch.

#. **Write good documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your
   contribution or changes, including comments in code, and relevant project
   documentation in rST or Markdown files.
   If you implement a new feature or change the behaviour of the library in any way,
   remember to mention it somewhere in the documentation (rST files in :file:`doc\source` directory)
   Follow the `numpydoc <numpydoc_>`_ convention for documenting code.

#. **Test your changes**: Thoroughly test your changes to ensure that they work
   as expected. If applicable, create or update the unit tests that run on the 
   continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to catch issues early
   and ensure reliable deployments. For more information, see `Unit testing`_.

#. **Respect code style and standards**: Follow code style
   guidelines and adhere to coding standards specific to your language or
   framework.

#. **Collaborate and communicate**: Communicate with team members, provide
   updates on your progress, and resolve any conflicts promptly.

#. **Ask for help**: To ensure code quality, identify issues, and share knowledge,
   ask PyMAPDL developers to assist you and review your code.
   If you need help or guidance, mention ``@ansys/pymapdl-maintainers`` in a comment
   so they they are notified.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure smooth and organized code
development within a repository, fostering collaboration, code quality, and feature enhancement.


.. _ref_unit_testing_contributing:

Unit testing
============

Unit tests validate the software by testing that the logic implemented inside a
certain method, class, or module is working as expected. They should be as
atomic and independent as possible.

Unit testing is highly important. The tests verify that code changes are
consistent with other parts of the code and verify that these changes are
implemented properly.

In the PyMAPDL repository, `pytest <pytest_>`_ is used to run tests and the
unit tests are in the `tests <pymapdl_tests_>`_ directory in this repository,
along with integration tests. The difference between a unit test and an
integration test is that the latter tests several units of the code to ensure
that they all work together.

To run all the unit tests use the following command:

.. code:: console

   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ pytest

If you are running on a **Linux machine without display**, you must install ``xvfb`` OS
library and run the preceding command with the ``xvfb-run`` command as prefix. 

.. code:: console

   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ xvfb-run pytest

In case you want to run only a certain subset of tests, you can use the ``-k`` argument
to filter the tests using booleans:

.. code:: console

   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ pytest -k "test_nlist_to_array or test_string_with_literal"

Creation of a unit test
-----------------------

The name of a ``pytest`` file must be in the form ``test_XXX.py``, where ``XXX``
is either the function, method, or class that you are testing or some other explicative
name. In the command line, you can use the ``-k`` argument to filter the tests to run.
For more information, see `pytest usage <pytest_usage_>`_.

Here are some guidelines for creating good unit tests: 

- Assign long and descriptive names to tests.
- Use the `Codecov <codecov_>`_ tool to ensure that all implemented code is tested.
- Check that tests return the same results each time. 
- Verify that tests are independent.
- Write tests that verify only one part of the code at a time.
- Make tests as short and fast as possible.

`What makes a good unit test? <article_good_unit_test_>`_ 
is an exhaustive list of tips for creating good unit tests.

Most PyMAPDL tests require a connection to a running instance of
MAPDL, which makes them integration tests. If your test
requires a running MAPDL instance, you can use the PyMAPDL
`mapdl <mapdl_fixture_>`_ method in your function signature.
It is executed upstream of each test and not within all tests.

.. code:: python

   def test_my_new_feature(mapdl):  # pass the 'mapdl' fixture as an argument.
       mapdl.prep7()
       # .... more code

       return True  # if everything goes ok until here

If you do not have MAPDL installed locally but still want to run the
unit testing, you must set up the following environment variables.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows
        :sync: key1

        .. code:: pwsh-session

            SET PYMAPDL_START_INSTANCE=False
            SET PYMAPDL_PORT=<MAPDL Port> (default 50052)
            SET PYMAPDL_IP=<MAPDL IP> (default 127.0.0.1)

    .. tab-item:: Linux
        :sync: key1
                
        .. code:: console

            export PYMAPDL_START_INSTANCE=False
            export PYMAPDL_PORT=<MAPDL Port> (default 50052)
            export PYMAPDL_IP=<MAPDL IP> (default 127.0.0.1)


These environment variables tell PyMAPDL to attempt to connect to the existing
MAPDL service by default when the ``launch_mapdl`` function is used.

Additionally, you can use the :envvar:`PYMAPDL_MAPDL_EXEC` and :envvar:`PYMAPDL_MAPDL_VERSION`
environment variables to specify the MAPDL executable path and the version to launch (if
multiple versions of MAPDL are installed).

Continuous integration and continuous deployment
------------------------------------------------

Unit tests and integration tests are part of continuous integration (CI). 
The automation of testing, monitoring, and deployment of newly added
code allows continuous deployment (CD) throughout the app lifecycle,
providing a comprehensive CI/CD approach.

.. figure:: ../images/cicd.jpg
    :width: 300pt

Example
--------

The `test_component.py <pymapdl_test_component_>`_ file contains
the unit tests and integration tests for the
:class:`ComponentManager <ansys.mapdl.core.component.ComponentManager>` class.
These tests are just some of the many in the `test directory <pymapdl_tests_>`_.

Here are some examples of how you use ``pytest``:

.. code:: python

    import pytest


    # 'cube_geom_and_mesh' is another fixture defined in 'conftest.py'
    @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
    def basic_components(mapdl, cube_geom_and_mesh):
        """Given a model in 'cube_geom_and_mesh', define some components to work with later."""
        mapdl.components["mycomp1"] = "NODE", [1, 2, 3]
        mapdl.components["mycomp2"] = "KP", [1, 3]

        mapdl.cmsel("s", "mycomp1")
        mapdl.cmsel("a", "mycomp2")


    def test_dunder_methods_keys(mapdl, basic_components):
        assert ["MYCOMP1", "MYCOMP2"] == list(mapdl.components.names())


    def test_dunder_methods_types(mapdl, basic_components):
        assert ["NODE", "KP"] == list(mapdl.components.types())


    def test_dunder_methods_items(mapdl, basic_components):
        assert [("MYCOMP1", "NODE"), ("MYCOMP2", "KP")] == list(mapdl.components.items())


For further ``pytest`` configuration details, see the `pytest documentation <pytest_>`_.


Code coverage
=============

To verify that all code is properly tested, you must ensure that every piece of
code is used (covered) in at least one unit test. In this repository, the
`Codecov <codecov_>`_ tool generates a coverage report of the committed code.
It indicates how merging a pull request would impact coverage. 
The generation of this report is one of the checks that must run successfully
to merge code changes.

.. figure:: ../images/codecov_increase.png
    :width: 400pt


Coverage example
----------------

To show how the coverage works, assume that you have
this library:

**Awesome library**

.. code:: python

    def get_report_colors(theme):
        if theme == "weather":
            colors = ["blue", "lightblue", "grey"]
        elif theme == "traffic":
            colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
        else:
            colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]

        return colors

**Tests**

You can opt to run the tests with this configuration:

.. code:: python

   def test_get_report_colors():
       assert get_report_colors("weather") == ["blue", "lightblue", "grey"]
       assert get_report_colors("traffic") == ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
       assert get_report_colors("other") == ["red", "blue", "green"]


Or, if a method is a bit more complex, you can split the case in different tests:

.. code:: python

    def test_get_report_colors_weather():
        assert get_report_colors("weather") == ["blue", "lightblue", "grey"]


    def test_get_report_colors_traffic():
        assert get_report_colors("traffic") == ["red", "orange", "yellow"]


    def test_get_report_colors_other():
        assert get_report_colors("other") == ["red", "blue", "green"]


While the code coverage in either case is 100% for the function, the second case is
more useful for debugging the function.

You can also use `parametrize (pytest.mark.parametrize) <pytest_parametrize_>`_ to
make the code more readable, and easier to reuse.

.. code:: python

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(
        "theme,output",
        [
            ["weather", "traffic", "other"],
            [
                ["blue", "lightblue", "grey"]["red", "orange", "yellow"][
                    "red", "blue", "green"
                ]
            ],
        ],
    )
    def test_get_report_color(theme, output):
        assert get_report_colors(theme) == output


For further explanations, see the `pytest documentation <pytest_>`_ .

Code style
==========

PyMAPDL follows the PEP8 standard as outlined in the `PyAnsys Development Guide
<dev_guide_pyansys_>`_ and implements style checking using
`pre-commit <precommit_>`_.

To ensure your code meets minimum code styling standards, run these commands:

.. code:: console

   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ pip install pre-commit
   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ pre-commit run --all-files

You can also install this as a pre-commit hook by running this command:

.. code:: console

    (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ pre-commit install

Since you have installed ``pre-commit`` as a hook, ``git`` automatically
runs these hooks before committing, failing if it find any
format issues and making or proposing the necessary changes
to the commit.
If this happens, you might need to run commit and edit these
changes several times before commit successfully.

.. code:: console

   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ git commit -m "my commit"
   [INFO] Stashing unstaged files to /home/mapdl/.cache/pre-commit/patch1704703895-16914.
   Add License Headers......................................................Passed
   isort....................................................................Passed
   numpydoc-validation......................................................Passed
   black....................................................................Passed
   blacken-docs.............................................................Failed
   - hook id: blacken-docs
   - exit code: 1
   - files were modified by this hook

   doc/source/getting_started/develop_pymapdl.rst: Rewriting...

This way, it's not possible for you to push code that fails the style checks. For example:

.. code:: console

   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ git commit -m "my commit"
   [WARNING] Unstaged files detected.
   [INFO] Stashing unstaged files to /home/mapdl/.cache/pre-commit/patch1704703895-16914.
   Add License Headers..................................(no files to check)Skipped
   isort................................................(no files to check)Skipped
   numpydoc-validation..................................(no files to check)Skipped
   black................................................(no files to check)Skipped
   blacken-docs.............................................................Passed
   flake8...............................................(no files to check)Skipped
   codespell................................................................Passed

   [ci/mybranch cXXXXXXX] my commit
   1 file changed, 25 insertions(+)
   (.venv) mapdl@machine:~/pymapdl$ 


First time you run ``pre-commit`` (using ``git commit`` or ``pre-commit``), the command
might take a bit of time (2-3 minutes) to download the specified hooks and install them.
After that first time, analysing your commits should take seconds.

``pre-commit`` hooks can also be updated, added or removed. For more information, visit
`pre-commit <precommit_>`_ website.
