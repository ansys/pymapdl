=============
This section gives an overview of the API of several public PyMAPDL
classes, functions, and attributes.

These methods may include some MAPDL commands but are generally
specific to pymapdl specific methods and classes (i.e. methods that
extend existing MAPDL methods in a pythonic manner).  For classic
MAPDL commands mapped to PyMAPDL, see :ref:`ref_mapdl_commands`.
