API reference
=============

This page gives an overview of the API of several public PyMAPDL
classes, functions, and attributes. You can find them
on the left sidebar.

While these methods might include some MAPDL commands, they are generally
specific to PyMAPDL methods and classes. PyMAPDL methods extend existing
MAPDL methods in a Pythonic manner. For a mapping of MAPDL commands to
PyMAPDL, see :ref:`ref_mapdl_commands`.
