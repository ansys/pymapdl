    Allows the creation of a larger graphic display than represented by the
    actual finite element analysis model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nrepeat1, nrepeat2, nrepeat3
        The number of repetitions required for the element pattern. The
        default is 0 (no expansion).

    type1, type2, type3
        The type of expansion requested.

        RECT - Causes a Cartesian transformation of DX, DY, and DZ for each pattern (default).

        POLAR - Causes a polar transformation of DR, D-Theta and DZ for each pattern.

        AXIS - Causes 2-D axisymmetric expansion (that is, rotates a 2-D model created in the
               X-Y plane about the Y axis to create a 3-D model).

        LRECT - Causes a Cartesian transformation of DX, DY, and DZ for each pattern about the
                current local coordinate system (specified via the CSYS
                command).

        LPOLAR - Causes a polar transformation of DR, D-Theta, and DZ for each pattern about the
                 local coordinate system (specified via the CSYS command).

    method1, method2, method3
        The method by which the pattern is repeated.

        FULL - Causes a normal repeat of the pattern (default).

        HALF - Uses a symmetry transformation for alternate repeats (to produce an image of a
               complete circular gear from the image of half a tooth, for
               example).

    dx1, dy1, dz1, dx2, dy2, dz2, dx3, dy3, dz3
        The Cartesian or polar increments between the repeated patterns.
        Also determines the reflection plane. Reflection is about the plane
        defined by the normal vector (DX, DY, DZ). If you want no
        translation, specify a small nonzero value.  For a half-image
        expansion, the increment DX, DY, or DZ is doubled so that
        POLAR,HALF, ,45 produces full images on 90Â° centers, and RECT,HALF,
        ,1 produces full images on 2-meter centers.

    Notes
    -----
    You can use the /EXPAND command to perform up to three symmetry
    expansions at once (that is, X, Y, and Z which is equal to going from a
    1/8 model to a full model). Polar expansions allow you to expand a
    wheel section into a half wheel, then into the half section, and then
    into the whole.

    The command displays elements/results when you issue the EPLOT command
    or postprocessing commands.

    The command works on all element and result displays, except as noted
    below. As the graphic display is created, the elements (and results)
    are repeated as many times as necessary, expanding the geometry and, if
    necessary, the displacements and stresses.

    Derived results are not supported.

    The /EXPAND command has the following limitations:

    It does not support solid model entities.

    POLAR, FULL or HALF operations are meaningful only in global
    cylindrical systems and are unaffected by the RSYS or DSYS commands.
    Cartesian symmetry or unsymmetric operations also occur about the
    global Cartesian system.

    It does not average nodal results across sector boundaries, even for
    averaged plots (such as those obtained via the PLNSOL command).

    Axisymmetric harmonic element results are not supported for Type =
    AXIS.

    The /EXPAND command differs significantly from the EXPAND command in
    several respects:

    The uses of /EXPAND are of a more general nature, whereas the EXPAND
    command is intended primarily to expand modal cyclic symmetry results.

    /EXPAND does not change the database as does the EXPAND command.

    You cannot print results displayed via /EXPAND.

    """APDL Command: /CYCEXPAND

    Graphically expands displacements, stresses and strains of a cyclically
    symmetric model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wn
        The window number to which the expansion applies. Valid values are
        1 through 5. The default value is 1. The window number applies only
        to the AMOUNT argument.

    option
        One of the following options:

        ON - Activates cyclic expansion using the previous settings (if any). If no previous
             settings exist, this option activates the default settings.

        DEFAULT - Resets cyclic expansion to the default settings.

        OFF - Deactivates cyclic expansion. This option is the default.

        STATUS - Lists the current cyclic expansion settings.

        AMOUNT - The number of repetitions or the total angle.

        Value1 - NREPEAT

        Value2 - The number of repetitions. The default is the total number of sectors in 360
                 degrees.

        or - Value1

        ANGLE - Value2

        The total angle in degrees. The default is 360. - WHAT

        A specified portion or subset of the model to expand: - Value1

        The component name of the elements to expand. The default is all selected components. - EDGE

        Sector edge display key. - -1

        Suppresses display of edges between sectors even if the cyclic count varies between active windows. - Caution:  Plots with fewer than the maximum number of repetitions may have
                          missing element faces at the sector boundaries.

        0 or OFF - Averages stresses or strains across sector boundaries. This value is the
                   default (although the default reverts to 1 or ON if the
                   cyclic count varies between active windows).

        1 or ON - No averaging of stresses or strains occurs and sector boundaries are shown on
                  the plot.

        PHASEANG - The phase angle shift:

        Value1 - The phase angle shift in degrees. The valid range is 0 through 360. The default
                 is 0. For a full harmonic solution, this value is
                 typically the phase angle obtained via the CYCPHASE
                 command. If Value1 = AMPLITUDE (or if Value1 â¥ 360), the
                 amplitude is supplied. The amplitude solution for non-
                 component results (such as equivalent stress) are not
                 valid. For a mode-superposition harmonic solution, if
                 Value1 = SWEEP, the maximum values across a phase angle
                 sweep are supplied.

    Notes
    -----
    In preprocessing, the /CYCEXPAND command verifies a cyclically
    symmetric model by graphically expanding it partially or through the
    full 360 degrees.

    For the postprocessing plot nodal solution (PLNSOL) operation, the
    command graphically expands displacements, stresses and strains of a
    cyclically symmetric model partially or though the full 360 degrees by
    combining the real (original nodes and elements) and imaginary
    (duplicate nodes and elements) parts of the solution.

    For the print nodal solution (PRNSOL) operation, the command expands
    the printed output of displacements or stresses on a sector-by-sector
    basis.

    Use of the /CYCEXPAND command does not change the database. The command
    does not modify the geometry, nodal displacements or element stresses.

    The command affects element and result plots only. It has no effect on
    operations other than plot element solution (PLESOL), plot nodal
    solution (PLNSOL), print nodal solution (PRNSOL), and calculate
    harmonic solution (CYCCALC). Operations other than PLESOL, PLNSOL,
    PRNSOL, or CYCCALC work on the unprocessed real and imaginary parts of
    a cyclic symmetry solution

    If you issue a /CYCEXPAND,,OFF command, you cannot then expand the
    model by simply issuing another  /CYCEXPAND command  (for example, to
    specify an NREPEAT value for the number of repetitions). In such a
    case, you must specify /CYCEXPAND,,ON, which activates expansion using
    the previous settings (if any) or the default settings.

    The command requires PowerGraphics and will turn PowerGraphics on
    (/GRAPHICS,POWER) if not already active. Any setting which bypasses
    PowerGraphics (for example, /PBF) also bypasses cyclic expansion; in
    such cases, the /CYCEXPAND command displays unprocessed real and
    imaginary results.

    The CYCPHASE command uses full model graphics (/GRAPHICS,FULL) to
    compute peak values. Because of this, there may be slight differences
    between max/min values obtained with CYCPHASE, and those obtained via
    /CYCEXPAND, which uses power graphics (/GRAPHICS,POWER).

    For PHASEANG = AMPLITUDE (or 360) with a cyclic full harmonic solution,
    the only appropriate coordinate system is the solution coordinate
    system (RSYS,SOLU)

    on a body using a circular path.  It is used for a circular or
    cylindrical body such as a rotor in an electric machine.  The body must
    be centered about the global origin and must be surrounded by air
    elements.  The air elements surrounding the path at radius RAD must be
    selected, and elements with a high-permeability material should be
    unselected prior to using the macro.  The macro is valid for 2-D planar
    analyses only.  For a harmonic analysis, the macro calculates the time-
    average torque.  Radial symmetry models are allowed, i.e., the model
    need not be a full 360Â° model.

    The calculated torque is stored in the parameter TORQUE.  If the model
    is not a full 360Â° model, TORQUE should be multiplied by the
    appropriate factor (such as 4.0 for a 90Â° sector) to obtain the total
    torque.  A node plot showing the path is produced in interactive mode.

    The torque is calculated via a circular path integral of the Maxwell
    stress tensor.  The circular path and the nodes for the path are
    created by the macro at the specified radius RAD.  Path operations are
    used for the calculation, and all path items are cleared upon
    completion.  See the TORQ2D command for torque calculation based on an
    arbitrary, non-circular path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rslab
        Response Surface set label. Identifies the response surfaces
        generated by the RSFIT command.

    nsim
        Number of simulation loops on the response surfaces that will be
        generated for all random output parameters. If the RSSIMS command
        is issued multiple times using the same response surface set label
        the NSIM Monte Carlo simulations is appended to previous ones. The
        default value for NSIM is 10,000.

    seed
        Seed value label. Random number generators require a seed value
        that is used to calculate the next random number. After each random
        number generation finishes, the seed value is updated and is used
        again to calculate the next random number. By default ANSYS
        initializes the seed value with the system time (one time only)
        when the ANSYS session started.

        CONT - Continues updating using the derived seed value (default).

        TIME - Initializes the seed value with the system time. You can use this if you want
               the seed value set to a specific value for one analysis and
               then you want to continue with a "random" seed in the next
               analysis. It is not recommended to "randomize" the seed
               value with the Seed = TIME option for multiple analyses. If
               the Monte Carlo simulations requested with this command will
               be appended to previously existing simulations, then the
               Seed option is ignored and Seed = CONT is used.

        INIT - Initializes the seed value using 123457. This value is a typical recommendation
               used very often in literature. This option leads to
               identical random numbers for all random input variables when
               the exact analysis will be repeated, making it useful for
               benchmarking and validation purposes (where identical random
               numbers are desired). If the Monte Carlo simulations
               requested with this command will be appended to previously
               existing simulations, then the Seed option is ignored and
               Seed = CONT is used.

        Value - Uses the specified (positive) value for the initialization of the seed value.
                This option has the same effect as Seed = INIT, except you
                can chose an arbitrary (positive) number for the

    Generate the Monte Carlo simulations on the response surfaces that are
    included in a response surface set. Simulations are evaluated only for
    the output parameters that have been fitted in a response surface set
    using the RSFIT command.

    If the RSSIMS command is issued multiple times using the same response
    surface label the probabilistic design system appends the samples
    generated here to the previous ones. This way you can start with a
    moderate NSIM number and add more samples if the probabilistic results

    Notes
    -----
    For selects based on non-integer numbers (e.g. coordinates, results,

    selected, where VMIN and VMAX are the range values input on the xSEL

    If VMIN = VMAX = 0.0, Toler = 1.0E-6.

    If VMAX â  VMIN, Toler = 1.0E-8 x (VMAX-VMIN).

    Calculates an inductance matrix and the total flux linkage for an
    N-winding coil system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symfac
        Geometric symmetry factor.  Inductance terms are scaled by this
        factor which represents the fraction of the total device modeled.
        Default is 1.

    coilname
        Alphanumeric prefix identifier for coil label used in defining
        named element coil components. Default is 'coil.'

    curname
        Name of a predefined parameter array containing the nominal coil
        currents of the system.  The array must be defined (see *DIM
        command) prior to calling the LMATRIX macro. Default is 'cur.'

    indname
        Name of the array parameter to be created by LMATRIX containing the
        calculated inductance matrix and the flux linkage in each coil.  A
        text file of the same name with an extension .TXT is created
        containing the matrix data. Default is 'lmatrix.'

    Notes
    -----
    LMATRIX calculates the differential inductance matrix for an N-winding
    system where N is the number of coils in the system, and calculates the
    total flux linkage in each coil. LMATRIX may only be executed after the
    solution of a problem with nominal currents applied to the coils at a
    desired "operating point." The array Indname has N rows and N+1
    columns. The N x N block is the differential inductance matrix; the
    N+1th column contains the total flux linkage, with the ith row
    corresponding to the ith coil. See the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference
    for more details.

    To invoke the LMATRIX macro, for the classical formulations, the
    elements for each coil must be grouped into a component using the CM
    command.  Each set of independent coil elements is assigned a component
    name with the prefix Coilname followed by the coil number. For the
    solenoidal formulations, you must make the exciting node with a F,AMPS
    load a node component using the CM command.  The classical and
    solenoidal formulations cannot be mixed.

    To invoke the LMATRIX macro, the vector array parameter Curname with
    dimension N must be defined and named using the *DIM command.  You must
    set each vector array entry equal to the nominal current per turn in
    the corresponding coil at the operating point.  Zero current values
    must be approximated by a negligibly small applied current.

    Do not apply (or remove) inhomogeneous loads before using the LMATRIX
    command. Inhomogeneous loads are those created by:

    Degree of freedom commands (D, DA, etc.) specifying nonzero degrees of
    freedom values on nodes or solid model entities

    Any CE command with a nonzero constant term

    Do not put any loads (for example, current) on elements not contained
    in the element component.

    Operating solutions must be obtained through static analysis before
    calling LMATRIX. All name-strings must be enclosed in single quotes in
    the LMATRIX command line. The geometric symmetry factor, Symfac,
    represents the fraction of the device modeled, disregarding any current
    source primitives.

    LMATRIX works only with magnetic field elements: PLANE53, SOLID96, and
    SOLID97, and with SOURC36 solenoidal formulations. For electromagnetic
    elements PLANE233, SOLID236 and SOLID237, static linear perturbation
    analysis can be used to calculate the differential inductance using the
    element incremental energy record (IENE).

    Analysis Guide.

    Notes
    -----
    The column to be graphed and the starting row for each array parameter
    must be specified as subscripts.  Additional columns of the ParY array
    parameter may be graphed by specifying column numbers for Y2,  Y3,

    the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns of array parameter DISP (all starting at
    row 8) are to be graphed against the 6th column of array parameter TIME
    (starting at row 4).  The columns are graphed from the starting row to
    their maximum extent.  See the *VLEN and  *VMASK commands to limit or
    skip data to be graphed.  The array parameters specified on the *VPLOT
    command must be of the same type (type ARRAY or TABLE; [*DIM].   Arrays
    of type TABLE are graphed as continuous curves.  Arrays of type ARRAY

    runs of the PREP7, SOLUTION, and POST1 phases of the ANSYS program with
    mesh density refinements based upon the percentage error in energy
    norm.

    The MADAPT command macro requires a second, user-defined macro, which
    must be named madaptld.mac and must reside in the same directory where
    ANSYS is being run. This madaptld macro must contain loads and boundary
    conditions, based on permanent geometry or solid model features (such
    as sides or vertices). Loads specified in the madaptld macro cannot be
    based on node numbers because the node numbers will change throughout
    the refinement process. This secondary macro is required because the
    MADAPT macro process must delete all loads and boundary conditions at
    every refinement step.

    MADAPT refines tetrahedral volume elements based on error. Hexahedra,
    wedges, and pyramids are not refined (see NREFINE).

    kcn
        Local coordinate system reference number or array interpretation
        pattern for this tabular function evaluation.

    Notes
    -----
     The SECFUNCTION command is associated with the section most recently
    defined via the SECTYPE command.

    A table (TABLE) can define tabular thickness as a function of
    coordinates. Alternatively, you can use an array parameter (indexed by
    node number) that expresses the function to be mapped. (For example,
    func (17) should be the desired shell thickness at node 17.)  To
    specify a table, enclose the table or array name in percent signs (%)
    (SECFUNCTION,%tablename%). Use the *DIM command to define a table.

    The table or array defines the total shell thickness at any point in
    space. In multilayered sections, the total thickness and each layer
    thickness are scaled accordingly.

    The Function Tool is a convenient way to define your thickness tables.
    For more information, see Using the Function Tool in the Basic Analysis
    Guide.

    If you do not specify a local coordinate system (KCN), the program
    interprets TABLE in global XYZ coordinates. (For information about
    local coordinate systems, see the LOCAL command documentation.)

    When KCN = NODE, the program interprets TABLE as an array parameter
    (indexed by node number) that expresses the function to be mapped.

    When KCN = NOD2, the program interprets TABLE as a 2-D array parameter
    (where columns contain node numbers and rows contain the corresponding
    thicknesses) that expresses the function to be mapped.

                 in a message dialog box.

        REPLOT - Controls whether or not an automatic replot occurs after functions affecting
                 the model are executed.

        ABORT - Controls whether or not ANSYS displays dialog boxes to show the status of an
                operation in progress and to cancel that operation.

        DYNA - Controls whether the dynamic mode preview is a bounding box or the edge outline
               of the model.  This label only applies to 2-D display
               devices (i.e., /SHOW,XII or /SHOW,WIN32).  This "model edge
               outline" mode is only supported in PowerGraphics
               [/GRAPHICS,POWER] and is intended for element, line,
               results, area, or volume displays.

        PICK - Controls how graphical entities are highlighted from within the ANSYS Select
               menu.

        POWER - Controls whether or not PowerGraphics is active when the GUI is initiated. The
                ANSYS program default status is PowerGraphics "ON";  this
                command is used (placed in the start.ans file) when full
                graphics is desired on start up.

        DPRO - Controls whether or not the ANSYS input window displays a dynamic prompt. The
               dynamic prompt shows the correct command syntax for the
               command, as you are entering it.

        UNDO - Controls whether or not the session editor includes nonessential commands or
               comments in the file it creates. You can use this option to
               include comments and other materials in the session editor
               file.

        LEGE - Controls whether or not the multi-legend is activated when you start the GUI.
               The multi-legend enables you to specify the location of your
               legend items in each of the five graphics windows. You can
               place this option in your start.ans file and have the GUI
               start with the legend items in a pre-specified location.

        PBAK - Controls whether or not the background shading is activated when you start the
               GUI. You can place this option in your start.ans file.

        ZPIC - Controls the sorting order for entities that are coincident (directly in front
               of or behind each other) to a picked spot on your model.
               When you pick a spot on your model that could indicate two
               or more entities, a message warns you of this condition, and
               a list of the coincident entities can be generated. The
               VALUE term (below) will determine the sort order.

        HPOP - Controls the prioritization of your GUI windows when the contents are ported to
               a plot or print file (/UI,COPY,SAVE). OpenGL (3D) graphics
               devices require that the ANSYS Graphics Screen contents be
               set in front of all overlying windows in order to port them
               to a printer or a file. This operation can sometimes
               conflict with /NOERASE settings. See the VALUE term (below)
               to determine the available control options.

    value
        Values controlling behavior if Label = BORD:

        1 - PAN, controls dynamic translations.

        2 - ZOOM, controls zoom, and dynamic rotation about the view vector.

        3 - ROTATE, controls dynamic rotation about the screen X and Y axes.

    Automatically generate superelements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode
        Specify action to take (must be specified as one of the following):

        AUTO - Turn on feature.

        OFF - Turn off feature.

    nsuper
        Number of superelements to create. The minimum number of
        superelements is 2, and the maximum number of superelements is 999.
        Note that the number of requested superelements may not be the same
        as the number of defined superelements (see "Notes" for more
        details).

    mdof
        Specifies whether to use the master DOF defined by the user.

        YES - Use master DOF defined by the user with the M command.

        NO - Use the master DOF defined by the automatic generation process. Be aware that
             this option can generate a large number of master DOFs (see
             "Notes"  for more details).

    stopstage
        Specifies when to stop the automatic superelement generation
        process.

        PREVIEW - Preview the superelements only; stop after creating the domains which will
                  become the superelements, and after creating master DOF
                  on the interfaces between each domain.

        GEN - Create (generate) the superelements.

    Notes
    -----
    This command can be used to quickly generate a set of superelements.
    Each superelement is created in a separate file (jobnameXXX.sub, where
    XXX is a positive number from 1 to 999).

    Due to the heuristics in the automatic domain decomposer, which is used
    to define the domains that will become superelements, the number of
    defined superelements may exceed the number of requested superelements.
    Use the mDof and stopStage options to determine exactly how many
    superelements will be created, the interfaces between each
    superelement, and where master DOF will be defined. With the
    /PNUM,DOMAIN command, you can graphically (visually) preview the
    elements in each superelement.  Then, if required, you can add
    additional master DOF to (or remove from) the boundaries of the
    superelements. Use the SEGEN command again with stopStage = GEN to
    actually create the superelements.

    ANSYS automatically defines master DOF at each of the following: all
    interface DOF between superelements, all DOF attached to contact
    elements (TARGE169 to CONTA177), and all DOF associated with nodes
    having a point load defined.  Note that for regular superelements, all
    interface DOFs must be defined as master DOFs for the correct solution
    to be obtained. However, for CMS superelements, some of the interface
    DOFs can be removed without a significant loss of accuracy.

    For the case when mDof = YES, you should select the preview option
    first (stopStage = PREVIEW) to verify exactly how many superelements
    will be created and where the superelement boundaries are located.  If
    more superelements will be created than were requested, you should
    define master DOF on the interface(s) between all superelements.

    This command is valid only for substructuring analyses (ANTYPE,SUBSTR).
    Use SEOPT to specify any options for all of the superelements (e.g.,
    which matrices to reduce), and possibly CMSOPT for any CMS
    substructuring analysis.  Note that the created superelements will
    follow the current /FILNAME instead of SENAME from SEOPT.  Also, only
    one load vector will be written to each .SUB file.  Multiple load steps
    are not supported with the automatic superelement generation process.

    During the actual creation of the superelements, the output is
    redirected to jobname.autoTemp.

    type\_
        Display type.  Defaults to ZBUF for raster mode displays or BASIC
        for vector mode displays:

        BASIC or 0 - Basic display (no hidden or section operations).

        SECT or 1 - Section display (plane view).  Use the /CPLANE command to define the cutting
                    plane.

        HIDC or 2 - Centroid hidden display (based on item centroid sort).

        HIDD or 3 - Face hidden display (based on face centroid sort).

        HIDP or 4 - Precise hidden display (like HIDD but with more precise checking). Because all
                    facets are sorted, this mode can be extremely slow,
                    especially for large models.

        CAP or 5 - Capped hidden display (same as combined SECT and HIDD with model in front of
                   section plane removed).

        ZBUF or 6 - Z-buffered display (like HIDD but using software Z-buffering).

        ZCAP or 7 - Capped Z-buffered display (same as combined SECT and ZBUF with model in front
                    of section plane removed).

        ZQSL or 8 - QSLICE Z-buffered display (same as SECT but the edge lines of the remaining 3-D
                    model are shown).

        HQSL or 9 - QSLICE precise hidden display (like ZQSL but using precise hidden).

    Notes
    -----
    Defines the type of display, such as section display or hidden-line
    display.  Use the /DEVICE command to specify either raster or vector
    mode.

    The SECT, CAP, ZCAP, ZQSL, and HQSL options produce section displays.
    The section or "cutting" plane is specified on the /CPLANE command as
    either normal to the viewing vector at the focus point (default), or as
    the working plane.

    When you use PowerGraphics, the section display options (Section,
    Slice, and Capped) use different averaging techniques for the interior
    and exterior results. Because of the different averaging schemes,
    anomalies may appear at the transition areas. In many cases, the
    automatically computed MIN and MAX values will differ from the full
    range of interior values. You can lessen the effect of these anomalies
    by issuing AVRES,,FULL (Main Menu> General Post Proc> Options for
    Outp). This command sets your legend's automatic contour interval range
    according to the minimum and maximum results found throughout the
    entire model.

    With PowerGraphics active (/GRAPHICS,POWER), the averaging scheme for
    surface data with interior element data included (AVRES,,FULL) and
    multiple facets per edge (/EFACET,2 or /EFACET,4) will yield differing
    minimum and maximum contour values depending on the  Z-Buffering
    options (/TYPE,,6 or /TYPE,,7).  When the Section data is not included
    in the averaging schemes (/TYPE,,7), the resulting absolute value for
    the midside node is significantly smaller.

    The HIDC, HIDD, HIDP, ZBUF, ZQSL, and HQSL options produce displays
    with "hidden" lines removed.  Hidden lines are lines obscured from view
    by another element, area, etc.  The choice of non-Z-buffered hidden-
    line procedure types is available only for raster mode [/DEVICE]
    displays.  For vector mode displays, all non-Z-buffered "hidden-line"
    options use the same procedure (which is slightly different from the
    raster procedures).  Both geometry and postprocessing displays may be
    of the hidden-line type.  Interior stress contour lines within solid
    elements can also be removed as hidden lines, leaving only the stress
    contour lines and element outlines on the visible surfaces.  Midside
    nodes of elements are ignored on postprocessing displays.  Overlapping
    elements will not be displayed.

    The ZBUF, ZCAP, and ZQSL options use a specific hidden-line technique
    called software Z-buffering.  This technique allows a more accurate
    display of overlapping surfaces (common when using Boolean operations
    or /ESHAPE on element displays), and allows smooth shaded displays on
    all interactive graphics displays.  Z-buffered displays can be
    performed faster than HIDP and CAP type displays for large models.  See
    also the /LIGHT, /SHADE, and /GFILE commands for additional options
    when Z-buffering is used.
