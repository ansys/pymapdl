        Parameters
        ----------
        ndigit
            Number of digits (3 to 32) in first table column (usually the node

            E - Exx.yy

        nwidth
            Total width (9 to 32) of the field (the xx in Ftype).  Initially
            defaults to 12.

        dsignf
            Number of digits after the decimal point (yy in F or E format) or
            number of significant digits in G format.  Range is 2 to xx-7 for
            Ftype = G or E; and 0 to xx-4 for Ftype = F.  Initially defaults to
            5.

        APDL Command: PRERR

        Notes
        -----
        Prints the percent error in structural energy norm (SEPC) and the
        thermal energy norm percent error (TEPC).  Approximations of mesh
        discretization error associated with a solution are calculated for
        analyses having structural or thermal degrees of freedom.

        The structural approximation is based on the energy error (which is
        similar in concept to the strain energy) and represents the error
        associated with the discrepancy between the calculated stress field and
        the globally continuous stress field (see POST1 - Error Approximation
        Technique in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference).  This discrepancy
        is due to the assumption in the elements that only the displacements
        are continuous at the nodes.  The stress field is calculated from the
        displacements and should also be continuous, but generally is not.

        Thermal analyses may use any solid and shell thermal element having
        only temperature degrees of freedom.  The thermal approximation is
        based on the total heat flow dissipation and represents the error
        associated with the discrepancy between the calculated nodal thermal
        flux within an element and a continuous global thermal flux.  This
        continuous thermal flux is calculated with the normal nodal averaging
        procedure.

        The volume (result label VOLU) is used to calculate the energy error
        per element (result label SERR for the structural energy error and TERR
        for the thermal energy error).  These energy errors, along with the
        appropriate energy, are then used to calculate the percent error in
        energy norm (SEPC for structural and TEPC for thermal). These
        percentages can be listed by the PRERR command, retrieved by the ``*GET``
        command (with labels SEPC and TEPC) for further calculations, and shown
        on the displacement display (PLDISP), as applicable.

        For structural analyses, the maximum absolute value of nodal stress
        variation of any stress component for any node of an element (result
        item SDSG) is also calculated.  Similarly, for thermal gradient
        components, TDSG is calculated.  Minimum and maximum result bounds
        considering the possible effect of discretization error will be shown
        on contour displays (PLNSOL).  For shell elements, the top surface
        location is used to produce a meaningful percentage value.  SERR, TERR,
        SEPC, TEPC, SDSG, and TDSG will be updated whenever the nodal stresses
        or fluxes are recalculated.

        If the energy error is a significant portion of the total energy, then
        the analysis should be repeated using a finer mesh to obtain a more
        accurate solution.  The energy error is relative from problem to
        problem but will converge to a zero energy error as the mesh is
        refined.  An automated adaptive meshing procedure using this energy
        error is described with the ADAPT macro.

        The following element- and material-type limitations apply:

        Valid with most 2-D solid, 3-D solid, axisymmetric solid, or 3-D shell
        elements.

        The following element types are not valid: SHELL28, SHELL41, and
        SOLID65.

        The model should have only structural or thermal degrees of freedom.

        The analysis must be linear (for both material and geometry).

        Multi-material (for example, composite) elements are not valid.

        Transition regions from one material to another are not valid (that is,
        the entire model should consist of one material).

        Anisotropic materials (TB,ANEL) are not considered.
