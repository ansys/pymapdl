        Parameters
        ----------
        fname1
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum,
            including directory) from which to read data for
            interpolation. If you do not specify a directory path, it
            will default to your working directory and you can use all
            248 characters for the file name.

        ext1
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        fname2
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum,
            including directory) to which BF commands are written. If
            you do not specify a directory path, it will default to
            your working directory and you can use all 248 characters
            for the file name.

        ext2
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        kpos
            Position on Fname2 to write block of BF commands:

            0 - Beginning of file (overwrite existing file).

            1 - End of file (append to existing file).

        clab
            Label (8 characters maximum, including the colon) for this
            block of BF commands in Fname2.  This label is appended to
            the colon (:).  Defaults to BFn, where n is the cumulative
            iteration number for the data set currently in the
            database.

        kshs
            Shell-to-solid submodeling key:

            0 - Solid-to-solid or shell-to-shell submodel.

            1 - Shell-to-solid submodel.

        tolout
            Extrapolation tolerance about elements, based on a
            fraction of the element dimension. Submodel nodes outside
            the element by more than TOLOUT are not accepted as
            candidates for DOF extrapolation.  Defaults to 0.5 (50%).

        tolhgt
            Height tolerance above or below shell elements, in units
            of length.  Used only for shell-to-shell submodeling (KSHS
            = 0). Submodel nodes off the element surface by more than
            TOLHGT are not accepted as candidates for DOF
            interpolation or extrapolation. Defaults to 0.0001 times
            the maximum element dimension.

        Notes
        -----
        File Fname1 should contain a node list for which body forces are to be
        interpolated [NWRITE].  File Fname2 is created, and contains
        interpolated body forces written as a block of nodal BF commands.

        Body forces are interpolated from elements having TEMP as a valid body
        force or degree of freedom, and only the label TEMP is written on the
        nodal BF commands.  Interpolation is performed for all nodes on file
        Fname1 using the results data currently in the database. For layered
        elements, use the LAYER command to select the locations of the
        temperatures to be used for interpolation. Default locations are the
        bottom of the bottom layer and the top of the top layer.

        The block of BF commands begins with an identifying colon label command
        and ends with a /EOF command.  The colon label command is of the form
        :Clab, where Clab is described above.  Interpolation from multiple
        results sets can be performed by looping through the results file in a
        user-defined macro.  Additional blocks can be appended to Fname2 by
        using KPOS and unique colon labels.  A /INPUT command, with the
        appropriate colon label, may be used to read the block of commands.

        If the model has coincident (or very close) nodes, BFINT must be
        applied to each part of the model separately to ensure that the mapping
        of the nodes is correct.  For example, if nodes belonging to two
        adjacent parts linked by springs are coincident, the operation should
        be performed on each part of the model separately.

            cumulative iteration number for the data set currently in
            the database.  For imaginary data (see KIMG on the ``*SET``
            command), Clab defaults to CIn.

            0 - Solid-to-solid or shell-to-shell submodel.

            the element by more than TOLOUT are not accepted as
            candidates for DOF extrapolation.  Defaults to 0.5 (50
            percent).

        tolhgt
            Height tolerance above or below shell elements, in units

            TOLHGT are not accepted as candidates for
            degree-of-freedom interpolation or extrapolation.
            Defaults to 0.0001 times the maximum element dimension.

        tolthk
            Height tolerance above or below shell elements, based on a
            fraction of the shell element thickness. Used only for
            shell-to-solid submodeling (KSHS = 1). Submodel nodes off
            the element surface by more than TOLTHK are not accepted
            as candidates for DOF interpolation or
            extrapolation. Defaults to 0.1 times the average shell
            thickness.

        Notes
        -----
        File Fname1 should contain a node list for which boundary
        conditions are to be interpolated (NWRITE).  File Fname2 is
        created to contain interpolated boundary conditions written as
        a block of D commands.

        Boundary conditions are written for the active
        degree-of-freedom set for the element from which interpolation
        is performed. Interpolation occurs on the selected set of
        elements.  The block of D commands begins with an identifying
        colon label and ends with a /EOF command.  The colon label is
        of the form :Clab (described above).

        Interpolation from multiple results sets can be performed by
        looping through the results file in a user-defined macro.
        Additional blocks can be appended to Fname2 by using KPOS and
        unique colon labels.  To read the block of commands, issue the
        /INPUT command with the appropriate colon label.

        If the model has coincident (or very close) nodes, the CBDOF
        must be applied to each part of the model separately to ensure
        that the mapping of the nodes is correct.  For example, if
        nodes belonging to two adjacent parts linked by springs are
        coincident, the operation should be performed on each part of
        the model separately.

        Resume the coarse model database at the beginning of the
        cut-boundary procedure. The database should have been saved
        after the first coarse model solution, as the number of nodes
        in the database and the results file must match, and internal
        nodes are sometimes created during the solution.

        Caution: Relaxing the TOLHGT or TOLTHK tolerances to allow
        submodel nodes to be "found" can produce poor submodel
        results.

        option
            Specifies the command operation:

            ADD - Add the specified component results file (Fname) to the list of files to plot.
                  This option is the default.

            DELETE - Remove the specified component results file (Fname) from the list of files to

            The file name (with full directory path) of the component results

            OFF - Do not check.

        Notes
        -----
        The CMSFILE command specifies the list of component mode synthesis
        (CMS) results files to include when plotting the mode shape of an
        assembly.

        During postprocessing (/POST1) of a CMS analysis, issue the CMSFILE
        command to point to component results files of interest. (You can issue
        the command as often as needed to include all or some of the component
        results files.) Issue the SET command to acquire the frequencies and
        mode shapes from substeps for all specified results files. Execute a
        plot (PLNSOL) or print (PRNSOL) operation to display the mode shape of
        the entire assembly.

        When you specify a results file to add to the plot list, the default
        behavior of the command (CmsKey = ON) is to first verify that the file
        is from a CMS analysis and that the frequencies of the result sets on
        the file match the frequencies on the first file in the list. If CmsKey
        = OFF, you can add any .rst file to the list of files to plot, even if
        the file was not expanded via a CMS expansion pass.

        If CmsKey = ON (default), output from the command appears as: ADD CMS
        FILE = filename.rst. : If CmsKey = OFF, output from the command appears
        as: ADD FILE = filename.rst.

        If Option = DELETE or CLEAR, you must clear the database (/CLEAR), then
        re-enter the postprocessor (/POST1) and issue a SET command for the
        change to take effect on subsequent plots.

        Clearing the database does not clear the list of files specified via
        the CMSFILE command. Specify Option = CLEAR to clear the list of files.

                     angle at which they occurred.

            STRAIN - Calculate the maximum and minimum possible strains at each node in the original
                     sector model.  Store the values and the phase angle at
                     which they occurred.

            ALL - Calculate the maximum and minimum possible displacement, stress and strain at
                  each node in the original sector model.  Store the values and
                  the phase angle at which they occurred.

            GET - Places the value of a MAX or MIN item into the _CYCVALUE parameter, the node
                  for that value in the _CYCNODE parameter, and the phase angle
                  for the value in the _CYCPHASE parameter.

            PUT - Put resulting sweep values for printing (via the PRNSOL command ) or plotting
                  (via the PLNSOL command).

            LIST - List the current minimum/maximum displacement, stress and strain nodal values.

            STAT - Summarize the results of the last phase sweep.

            CLEAR - Clear phase-sweep information from the database.

        option
            If TYPE = DISP, STRAIN, STRESS or ALL, controls the sweep angle
            increment to use in the search:

            Angle - The sweep angle increment in degrees, greater than 0.1 and less than 10. The
                    default is 1.

        Notes
        -----
        When you expand the results of a modal cyclic symmetry analysis (via
        the /CYCEXPAND or EXPAND command), ANSYS combines the real and
        imaginary results for a given nodal diameter, assuming no phase shift
        between them; however, the modal response can occur at any phase shift.

        CYCPHASE response results are valid only for the first cyclic sector.
        To obtain the response at any part of the expanded model, ANSYS, Inc.
        recommends using cyclic symmetry results expansion at the phase angle
        obtained via CYCPHASE.

        The phase angles returned by CYCPHASE contain the minimum and maximum
        values for USUM, SEQV and other scalar principal stress and strain
        quantities; however, they do not always return the true minimum and
        maximum values for directional quantities like UX or SX unless the
        values fall in the first sector.

        CYCPHASE does not consider midside node values when evaluating maximum
        and minimum values, which may affect DISPLAY quantities but no others.
        (Typically, ANSYS ignores midside node stresses and strains during
        postprocessing.)

        Issuing CYCPHASE,PUT clears the result values for midside nodes on high
        order elements; therefore, this option sets element faceting (/EFACET)
        to 1. The command reports that midside nodal values are set to zero and
        indicates that element faceting is set to 1.

        If the sweep values are available after issuing a CYCPHASE,PUT command,
        the PRNSOL or PLNSOL command will print or plot (respectively) the
        sweep values of structure displacement Ux, Uy, Uz, component
        stress/strain X, Y, Z, XY, YZ, ZX, principal stress/strain 1, 2, 3 and
        equivalent stress/strain EQV.  The vector sum of displacement (USUM)
        and stress/strain intensity (SINT) are not valid phase-sweep results.

        You can specify any coordinate system via the RSYS command for
        displaying or printing CYCPHASE results. However, after CYCPHASE
        results have been extracted, you cannot then transform them via the
        RSYS command. If you try to do so, ANSYS issues a warning message.

        The CYCPHASE command is valid in /POST1 and for cyclically symmetric
        models only.

        To learn more about analyzing a cyclically symmetric structure, see the
        Cyclic Symmetry Analysis Guide.

            X,Y,Z - Direct components

            XY,YZ,XZ - Shear components (stress and strain only)

            1,2,3 - Principal values (stress and strain only)

            EQV - Equivalent value (stress and strain only)

            SUM - Vector sum (displacement only)

            NORM - L2 norm for the set of nodes (displacement only)

        Notes
        -----
        Up to 50 specifications can be defined for use in a subsequent CYCCALC
        command. If more than 50 specifications are desired, erase the table
        after the CYCCALC operation and add new specifications and repeat the
        CYCCALC command. All the specified nodes, items, and components are
        evaluated for all sectors and the maximum amplitude value output. For
        combined stresses and strains (Comp = 1,2,3 or EQV) or displacement
        vector sum (Comp = SUM), a 360 degree phase sweep is performed at each
        location to determine the maximum.

        Additional POST1 controls are used to refine the specification. For
        component values, components are in the RSYS direction. For shell
        elements, the results are at the SHELL location. For EPEL,EQV, the
        results are based on the EFFNU value on the AVPRIN command. The
        controls active when the CYCCALC command is issued determine the result
        values. If results at another SHELL location are desired, issue the new
        SHELL command and then re-issue the CYCCALC command.

        If a single node is input, the Item/Comp value at that location in each
        sector is output. If a node component is given, then the maximum
        Item/Comp value within the set of nodes of each sector is output, one
        value for each sector (the node of the maximum may vary from sector to
        sector). For stress and strain items, only corner nodes are valid.

        For the displacement norm option (Item = U, Comp = NORM), the L2 norm
        computed from all the nodes in the component is output, one per sector.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nrepeat
            Number of sector repetitions for expansion. The default is 0 (no

        icsys
            The coordinate system number used in the modal cyclic symmetry
            solution. The default is the global cylindrical coordinate system
            (specified via the CSYS command where KCN = 1).

        sctang

        phase
            The phase angle in degrees to use for the expansion. The default is

            phase angle obtained via the CYCPHASE command.

        Notes
        -----
        Issue this command to display the results of a modal cyclic symmetry
        analysis.

        When you issue the EXPAND,Nrepeat command, subsequent SET commands read
        data from the results file and expand them to Nrepeat sectors. As long
        as no entities have been modified, this expansion can be negated (that
        is, reverted to single sector) by issuing EXPAND with no arguments. If
        you modify entities and wish to return to the partial model, use the
        Session Editor (see Restoring Database Contents in the Operations
        Guide).

        EXPAND displays the results and allows you to print them, as if for a
        full model. The harmonic index (automatically retrieved from the
        results file) appears in the legend column.

        When plotting or printing element strain energy (SENE), the EXPAND
        command works with brick or tet models only. Element kinetic energy
        (KENE) plotting or printing is not supported.

        EXPAND is a specification command valid only in POST1.  It is
        significantly different from the /CYCEXPAND command in several
        respects, (although you can use either command to display the results
        of a modal cyclic symmetry analysis):

        EXPAND has none of the limitations of the /CYCEXPAND command.

        EXPAND changes the database by modifying the geometry, the nodal
        displacements, and element stresses as they are read from the results
        file, whereas the /CYCEXPAND command does not change the database.

        Caution:: : The EXPAND command creates new nodes and elements;
        therefore, saving (or issuing the /EXIT, ALL command) after issuing the
        EXPAND command can result in large databases.

            Load type:

            SURF  - Surface load.

            VOLU  - Volumetric load.

        load
            Surface loads:

            DISP  - Displacement (in a static analysis) or mode shape and global parameters (in a
                    modal analysis).

            MODE  - Normalized mode shape and global parameters (in a modal analysis only).

            TEMP  - Temperature.

            HFLU  - Heat flux.

        value
            If a positive integer, specifies the number of the surface or
            volume interface. If 0 (zero), the selected nodes or Named
            Selection are used.

        pname
            Field name in CFX Profile file (32-character maximum). Defaults to
            jobname_bcploadnumber for a surface load and jobname_subdloadnumber
            for volumetric load.

        fname
            The CFX Profile filename (248-character maximum). Defaults to
            jobname_bcploadnumber for a surface load and jobname_subdloadnumber
            for a volumetric load.

        fext
            The Profile file extension (8-character maximum). Defaults to.csv.

        fdir
            The Profile file directory (8-character maximum). Defaults to
            current directory.

        Notes
        -----
        By default, the EXPROFILE command assumes the data it writes to the
        Profile file are in SI units. For models not described in SI units,
        issue the EXUNIT command as needed to write the correct unit labels on
        the Profile file.

        For a modal analysis, if Load = DISP or MODE, global parameters
        including mass, frequency, and maximum displacement are also written to
        the ANSYS CFX Profile file. You should therefore issue the EXUNIT
        command for DISP, TIME, and MASS.

        Verify that the coordinate system is set to the global Cartesian
        (RSYS,0) before using this command.

        To transfer multiple loads across an interface, specify a unique file
        name and extension for each load.

        Force (FORC) and heat generation (HGEN) are per-unit volume.

        For modal analysis, this command does not support the following mode-
        extraction methods (MODOPT): unsymmetric matrix (UNSYM), the damped
        system (DAMP), or the QR-damped system (QRDAMP).

        To write the normalized (instead of non-normalized) mode shapes from a
        modal analysis to the file:

        Use Load = MODE.

        Verify that the mode shapes are normalized to the mass matrix
        (MODOPT,,,,,,OFF), the default behavior.

        Verify that the scale factor is set to 1.0 (SET,,,1.0), the default
        value.

        For loads not specified directly via commands (such as SF and BF),
        loads must first be read into the database (SET or LCASE).

        Sums and prints, in each component direction for the total selected
        node set, the nodal force and moment contributions of the selected
        elements attached to the node set. Selecting a subset of nodes [NSEL]
        and then issuing this command will give the total force acting on that
        set of nodes (default), excluding surface-to-surface, node-to-surface,
        line-to-line, and line-to-surface contact elements (TARGE169, TARGE170,
        CONTA171, CONTA172, CONTA173, CONTA174, CONTA175, CONTA176, and
        CONTA177).

        Setting ITEM = CONT sums the nodal forces and moment contributions of
        the selected contact elements (CONTA171, CONTA172, CONTA173, CONTA174,
        CONTA175, CONTA176, and CONTA177). Setting ITEM = BOTH sums the nodal
        forces for all selected nodes, including contact elements.

        Nodal forces associated with surface loads are not included. The
        effects of nodal coupling and constraint equations are ignored. Moment
        summations are about the global origin unless another point is
        specified with the SPOINT command. This vector sum is printed in the
        global Cartesian system unless it is transformed [RSYS] and a point is
        specified with the SPOINT command. By default, the sum is done in
        global Cartesian, and the resulting vector is transformed to the
        requested system.

        The LAB = RSYS option transforms each of the nodal forces into the
        active coordinate system before summing and printing. The FORCE command
        can be used to specify which component (static, damping, inertia, or
        total) of the nodal load is to be used. This command output is included
        in the NFORCE command.

        The command should not be used with axisymmetric elements because it
        might calculate a moment where none exists. Consider, for example, the
        axial load on a pipe modeled with an axisymmetric shell element.  The
        reaction force on the end of the pipe is the total force (for the full
        360 degrees) at that location. The net moment about the centerline of
        the pipe would be zero, but the program would incorrectly calculate a
        moment at the end of the element as the force multiplied by the radius.

        The command is not valid for elements that operate solely within the
        nodal coordinate system with 1-D option activated and rotated nodes
        (NROTAT).

        Calculates the stress intensity factors (KI, KII, and KIII) associated
        with homogeneous isotropic linear elastic fracture mechanics.  A
        displacement extrapolation method is used in the calculation (see POST1
        -  Crack Analysis in the Mechanical APDL Theory Reference). This method
        assumes that the displacement calculations are for the plane strain
        state. If the displacement calculations are performed using a plane
        stress formulation, the calculation of the stress intensity factors can
        be converted to the plane strain state by using KPLAN = 1. ANSYS Uses
        minor Poisson's ratio (MP,NUXY) for the stress intensity factor
        calculation, therefore the material's Poisson's ratio must be defined
        using MP,NUXY command. The PATH and PPATH commands must be used to
        define a path with the crack face nodes (NODE1 at the crack tip, NODE2
        and NODE3 on one face, NODE4 and NODE5 on the other (optional) face).
        A crack-tip coordinate system, having x parallel to the crack face (and
        perpendicular to the crack front) and y perpendicular to the crack
        face, must be the active RSYS and CSYS before KCALC is issued.

                   elements.

        Notes
        -----
        Sums and prints, in each component direction for each selected node,
        the nodal force and moment contributions of the selected elements
        attached to the node.  If all elements are selected, the sums are
        usually zero except where constraints or loads are applied.  The nodal
        forces and moments may be displayed [/PBC,FORC and /PBC,MOME].  Use
        PRESOL to print nodal forces and moments on an element-by-element
        basis.  You can use the FORCE command to specify which component
        (static, damping, inertia, or total) of the nodal load is to be used.
        Nodal forces associated with surface loads are not included.

        This vector sum is printed in the global Cartesian system. Moment
        summations are about the global origin unless another point is
        specified with the SPOINT command.  The summations for each node are
        printed in the global Cartesian system unless transformed [RSYS].  This
        command is generally not applicable to axisymmetric models because
        moment information from the NFORCE command is not correct for
        axisymmetric elements.

        Selecting a subset of elements [ESEL] and then issuing this command
        will give the forces and moments required to maintain equilibrium of
        that set of elements.  The effects of nodal coupling and constraint
        equations are ignored. The option ITEM = CONT provides the forces and

        CONTA174, CONTA175, CONTA176, and CONTA177). Setting ITEM = BOTH
        provides the forces and moments for all selected nodes, including
        contact elements.

                 when Label = EFLG.

        fileid
            Valid only when Label = EFLG and Key = CM, this value specifies

                         decrements printout (STABVAL = 1 or 2)

        unit
            Specifies the unit of measurement for rotational angular
            velocities:

            RDS - Rotational angular velocities in radians per second (rad/s). This value is the

            The default is zero.

        cname
            The rotating component name.

        stabval
            Flag to plot the stability values:

            0 (OFF or NO) - Plot the frequencies (the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in Hz). This value
                            is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Negative and positive frequencies are plotted.

        Notes
        -----
        The following items are required when generating a Campbell diagram:

        Take the gyroscopic effect into account by issuing the CORIOLIS command
        in the SOLUTION module.

        Run a modal analysis using the QR damped (MODOPT,QRDAMP) or damped
        (MODOPT,DAMP) method. Complex eigenmodes are necessary
        (MODOPT,QRDAMP,,,,Cpxmod  = ON), and you must specify the number of
        modes to expand (MXPAND).

        Define two or more load step results with an ascending order of
        rotational velocity (OMEGA or CMOMEGA).

        In some cases where modes are not in the same order from one load step
        to the other, sorting the frequencies (Option = 1) can help to obtain a
        correct plot. Sorting is based on the comparison between complex mode
        shapes calculated at two successive load steps.

        At each load step, the application compares the mode shape to the loads
        at other load steps to determine whirl direction at the load step. If
        applicable, a label appears (in the plot legend) representing each
        whirl mode (BW for backward whirl and FW for forward whirl).

        At each load step, the program checks for instability (based on the
        sign of the real part of the eigenvalue). The labels "stable" or
        "unstable" appear in the plot legend for each frequency curve.

        The rotational velocities of a named component (Cname) are displayed on
        the X-axis.

        For information on plotting a Campbell diagram for a prestressed
        structure, see Solving for a Subsequent Campbell Analysis of a
        Prestressed Structure Using the Linear Perturbation Procedure in the
        Rotordynamic Analysis Guide.

        In general, plotting a Campbell diagram is recommended only when your
        analysis is performed in a stationary reference frame
        (CORIOLIS,,,,RefFrame = ON).

        Parameters
        ----------
        option
            Flag to activate or deactivate sorting of forward or backward whirl
            frequencies:

            0 (OFF or NO) - No sorting.

            1 (ON or YES) - Sort. This value is the default.

        slope
            The slope of the line to be printed. This value must be positive.

            SLOPE > 0  - The line represents the number of excitations per revolution of the rotor. For
                         example, SLOPE = 1 represents one excitation per
                         revolution, usually resulting from unbalance.

            SLOPE = 0  - The line represents the stability threshold for stability values or logarithmic
                         decrements printout (STABVAL = 1 or 2)

        unit
            Specifies the unit of measurement for rotational angular
            velocities:

            RDS - Rotational angular velocities in radians per second (rad/s). This value is the
                  default.

            RPM - Rotational angular velocities in revolutions per minute (RPMs).

        freqb
            The beginning, or lower end, of the frequency range of interest.
            The default is zero.

        cname
            The rotating component name.

        stabval
            Flag to print the stability values:

            0 (OFF or NO) - Print the frequencies (the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in Hz). This
                            value is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Print the stability values (the real parts of the eigenvalues in Hz).

            2 - Print the logarithmic decrements.

        keyallfreq
            Key to specify if all frequencies above FREQB are printed out:

            0 (OFF or NO) - A maximum of 10 frequencies are printed out. They correspond to the frequencies
                            displayed via the PLCAMP command. This value is the
                            default.

            1 (ON or YES) - All frequencies are printed out.

        keynegfreq
            Key to specify if the negative frequencies are printed out. It only
            applies to solutions obtained with the damped eigensolver
            (Method=DAMP on the MODOPT command):

            0 (OFF or NO) - Only positive frequencies are printed out. This value is the default.

            1 (ON or YES) - Negative and positive frequencies are printed out.

        Notes
        -----
        The following items are required when generating a Campbell diagram:

        Take the gyroscopic effect into account by issuing the CORIOLIS command
        in the SOLUTION module.

        Run a modal analysis using the QR damped (MODOPT,QRDAMP) or damped
        (MODOPT,DAMP) method. Complex eigenmodes are necessary
        (MODOPT,QRDAMP,,,,Cpxmod  = ON), and you must specify the number of
        modes to expand (MXPAND).

        Define two or more load step results with an ascending order of
        rotational velocity (OMEGA or CMOMEGA).

        In some cases where modes are not in the same order from one load step
        to the other, sorting the frequencies (Option = 1) can help to obtain a
        correct printout. Sorting is based on the comparison between complex
        mode shapes calculated at two successive load steps.

        At each load step, the application compares the mode shape to the loads
        to determine the whirl direction. If applicable, a label appears (on
        the rows of output data) representing the whirl mode (BW for backward
        whirl and FW for forward whirl).

        If you specify a non-zero slope (SLOPE > 0), the command prints the
        critical speeds corresponding to the intersection points of the
        frequency curves and the added line. In the case of a named component
        (Cname), critical speeds relate to the rotational velocity of the
        component. Critical speeds are available only if the frequencies are
        printed (STABVAL = OFF).

        If you specify a zero slope (SLOPE = 0), the command prints the
        stability threshold corresponding to the sign change of the stability
        values (or logarithmic decrements). In the case of a named component
        (Cname), stability thresholds relate to the rotational velocity of the
        component. Stability thresholds are available only if the stability
        values or logarithmic decrements are printed (STABVAL = 1 or 2).

        At each load step, the program checks for instability (based on the
        sign of the real part of the eigenvalue). The label "U" appears on the
        printout for each unstable frequency.

        If specified, the rotational velocities of the named component (Cname)
        are printed out along with the natural frequencies.

        In general, printing a Campbell diagram is recommended only when your
        analysis is performed in a stationary reference frame
        (CORIOLIS,,,,RefFrame = ON).

        For information on printing a Campbell diagram for a prestressed
        structure, see Solving for a Subsequent Campbell Analysis of a
        Prestressed Structure Using the Linear Perturbation Procedure in the
        Rotordynamic Analysis Guide.

        a Campbell diagram), see Example Campbell Diagram Analysis.

        Notes
        -----
        The RESWRITE command appends a data set to the specified file
        by writing the results data currently in the database. If the
        intended results file does not exist, it will be created and
        will include the geometry records. The current load step,
        substep, and time (or frequency) value are maintained. All

        The command is primarily intended for use in a top-down

        analysis).

        The RESWRITE command can also be used to write a global

        solution. This should only be necessary if the RESCOMBINE
        command was used to combine results from local results files

            ALL  - Use all selected element components (CMSEL) (default).

            ESEL  - Use the currently selected (ESEL) set of elements. Name1 defines the results
                    file name.

            LIST - Use Name1 to Name16 to list the element component and/or assembly names (that
                   contain element components).

        name1, name2, name3, . . . , name16
            Up to 16 element component and/or assembly names (that contain
            element components).

        Notes
        -----
        Results files will be named based on the element component or assembly
        name, e.g., Cname.rst, except for the ESEL option, for which you must
        specify the results file name (no extension) using the Name1 field.
        Note that the .rst filename will be written in all uppercase letters
        (CNAME.rst) (unless using the ESEL option); when you read the file, you
        must specify the filename using all uppercase letters (i.e.,
        file,CNAME). You may repeat the RSPLIT command as often as needed. All
        results sets on the results file are processed. Use /AUX3 to produce a
        results file with just a subset of the results sets.

        Use INRES to limit the results data written to the results files.

        The subset geometry is also written so that no database file is
        required to postprocess the subset results files. You must not resume
        any database when postprocessing one of these results files. The input
        results file must have geometry written to it (i.e., do not use
        /CONFIG,NORSTGM,1).

        Applied forces and reaction forces are not apportioned if their nodes
        are shared by multiple element subsets. Their full values are written
        to each results file.

        Each results file renumbers its nodes and elements starting with 1.

        This feature is useful when working with large models. For more
        information on the advantages and uses of the RSPLIT command, see
        Splitting Large Results Files in the Basic Analysis Guide.

        Calculates modal assurance criterion (MAC) and matches nodal solutions
        from two results files or from one results file and one universal
        format file.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file1
            File name (32 characters maximum) corresponding to the first
            results file (.rst or .rstp file). If the file name does not
            contain the extension, it defaults to .rst.

        lstep1
            Load step number of the results to be read in File1.

            N  - Reads load step N. Defaults to 1.

        sbstep1
            Substep number of the results to be read in File1.

            N  - Reads substep N.

            All  - Reads all substeps. This value is the default.

        file2
            File name (32 characters maximum) corresponding to the second file
            (.rst, .rstp, or .unv file). If the file name does not contain the
            extension, it defaults to .rst.

        lstep2
            Load step number of the results to be read in File2.

            N  - Reads load step N. Defaults to 1.

        sbstep2
            Substep number of the results to be read in File2.

            N  - Reads substep N.

            All  - Reads all substeps. This value is the default.

        maclim
            Smallest acceptable MAC value. Must be  0 and  1. The default value
            is 0.90.

        cname
            Name of the component from the first file (File1). The component
            must be based on nodes. If unspecified, all nodes are matched and
            used for MAC calculations. If a component name is specified, only
            nodes included in the specified component are used. Not applicable
            to node mapping (TolerN=-1).

        keyprint
            Printout options:

            0  - Printout matched solutions table. This value is the default.

            1  - Printout matched solutions table and full MAC table.

            2  - Printout matched solutions table, full MAC table and matched nodes table.

        Notes
        -----
        The RSTMAC command allows the comparison of the solutions from
        either:

        Two different results files

        One result file and one universal format file

        The modal assurance criterion (MAC) is used.

        The meshes read on File1 and File2 may be different. If TolerN>0,
        the nodes are matched. This is the default. If TolerN = -1, the
        nodes are mapped and the solutions are interpolated from File1.

        Units and coordinate systems must be the same for both
        models. When a universal format file is used, the nodal
        coordinates can be scaled using UNVscale.

        The corresponding database file (.db) for File1 must be resumed
        before running the command only if a component (Cname) is used or
        if the nodes are mapped (TolerN = -1).

        Results may be real or complex; however, if results from File1
        have a different type from results in File2, only the real parts
        of the solutions are taken into account in MAC calculations. The
        analysis type can be arbitrary.

        Only structural degrees of freedom are considered. Degrees of
        freedom can vary between File1 and File2, but at least one common
        degree of freedom must exist.

        When node mapping and solution interpolation is performed
        (TolerN=-1), File1 must correspond to a model meshed in solid
        and/or shell elements.  Other types of elements can be present but
        the node mapping is not performed for those
        elements. Interpolation is performed on UX, UY, and UZ degrees of
        freedom.

        The solutions read on the results files are not all written to the
        database, therefore, subsequent plotting or printing of solutions
        is not possible.  A SET command must be issued after the RSTMAC
        command to post-process each solution.

        RSTMAC comparison on cyclic symmetry analysis works only if the
        number of sectors on File1 and File2 are the same. Also comparison
        cannot be made between cyclic symmetry results and full 360 degree
        model results (File1 – cyclic solution, File2 – full 360 degree
        model solution).  Comparing cyclic symmetry solutions written on
        selected set of node (OUTRES) is not supported.

        The modal assurance criterion values can be retrieved as
        parameters using the ``*GET`` command (Entity = RSTMAC).

        From Two Models (RSTMAC) in the Basic Analysis Guide.

        Notes
        -----
        The SPMWRITE generates the file Jobname.SPM containing the state-space
        matrices and other information.

        The following applies to the SML formats (FileFormat = 2, 3, and 4):

        For conservative systems where the outputs are equal to the inputs
        (Outputs is left blank):

        The labels for the inputs (InputLabels) are required.

        The Inputs must use the array parameter option so that the input
        degrees of freedom (DOFs) are known.

        For non-conservative systems where the outputs are not equal to the
        inputs:

        The labels for the outputs (OutputLabels) are required.

        The file formats with references (FileFormat = 3 and 4) do not apply.

        Velocity and acceleration results are not included in the state-space
        matrices calculation (VelAccKey = OFF)

        File format with common reference (FileFormat = 3) does not apply if
        the inputs are based on DOFs of a different nature.  All input DOFs
        must be either all rotational or all translational and not a mix of the
        two.

        A graphics file (Jobname_SPM.PNG) is generated. It contains an element
        plot of the model.
