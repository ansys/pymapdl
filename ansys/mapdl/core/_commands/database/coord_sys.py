        working plane tracking, activate any other coordinate system.

        >>> mapdl.csys(5)

        is a cylindrical coordinate system with global Cartesian Y as
        the axis. The local x, y and z axes are radial, θ, and axial
        (respectively). The R-Theta plane is the global X-Z plane, as it is for
        an axisymmetric model. Thus, at `θ = 0.0`, `mapdl.csys(5)` has a specific
        orientation: the local x is in the global +X direction, local y is in
        the global -Z direction, and local z (the cylindrical axis) is in the
