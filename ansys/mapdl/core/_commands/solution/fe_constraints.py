        """Defines degree-of-freedom constraints at nodes.

        APDL Command: D

        Parameters
        ----------
        node
            Node at which constraint is to be specified. If ALL, NEND and NINC
            are ignored and constraints are applied to all selected nodes
            (NSEL). If Node = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining
            command fields are ignored (valid only in the GUI).  A component
            name may also be substituted for Node.

        lab
            Valid degree-of-freedom label.  If ALL, use all appropriate labels.

        value
            Degree-of-freedom value or table name reference for tabular
            boundary conditions.  To specify a table, enclose the table name in
            percent (%) signs (for example, D,Node,TEMP,%tabname%). Use the
            ``*DIM`` command to define a table.

        value2
            Second degree-of-freedom value (if any).  If the analysis type and
            the degree of freedom allow a complex input, Value (above) is the
            real component and VALUE2 is the imaginary component.

        nend, ninc
            Specifies the same values of constraint at the range of nodes from
            Node to NEND (defaults to Node), in steps of NINC (defaults to 1).

        lab2, lab3, lab4, lab5, lab6
            Additional degree-of-freedom labels. The same values are applied to
            the nodes for these labels.

        Notes
        -----
        The available degrees of freedom per node are listed under "Degrees of
        Freedom" in the input table for each element type in the Element
        Reference.  Degrees of freedom are defined in the nodal coordinate
        system.  The positive directions of structural translations and
        rotations are along and about the positive nodal axes directions.
        Structural rotations should be input in radians.  The node and the
        degree-of-freedom label must be selected (NSEL, DOFSEL).

        In a structural analysis, you can apply only one displacement,
        velocity, or acceleration load at any degree of freedom. If multiple
        loads are specified, the last applied load overrides the previous ones.
        For example, the following commands apply loads to node 100:

        In this case, the velocity load (VELX) applied in the last command will
        override the displacement load (UX).

        For elements used in static and low frequency electromagnetic analysis
        (SOLID236 and SOLID237), the AZ degree of freedom is not a z-component
        of a vector potential, but rather the flux contribution on the element
        edge.  To specify a flux-parallel condition, set AZ = 0.  For more
        information, see 3-D Magnetostatics and Fundamentals of Edge-based
        Analysis in the Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Analysis Guide.

        In an explicit dynamic analysis, the D command can only be used to fix
        nodes in the model. The degree-of-freedom value must be zero; no other
        values are valid. Use the EDLOAD command to apply a nonzero
        displacement in an explicit dynamic analysis.

        For ELBOW290 cross-section degrees of freedom (Lab = SE, SO, SW, SRA,
        SRT, or SECT), the D command can only specify fixed constraints. The
        degree-of-freedom value must be zero; no other values are valid.

        For hydrostatic fluid elements (HSFLD241 and HSFLD242), the HDSP
        degree-of-freedom constraint at the pressure node prescribes the
        pressure value for all the fluid elements sharing the pressure node.

        Tabular boundary conditions (VALUE = %tabname%) are available only for
        the following degree-of-freedom labels: Electric (VOLT), structural
        (UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ, and velocity and acceleration loads
        VELX, VELY, VELZ, OMGX, OMGY, OMGZ, ACCX, ACCY, ACCZ, DMGX, DMGY,
        DMGZ), acoustic (PRES, UX, UY, UZ,), and temperature (TEMP, TBOT, TE2,
        TE3, . . ., TTOP). All labels are valid only in static (ANTYPE,STATIC)
        and full transient (ANTYPE,TRANS) analyses.

        %_FIX% is an ANSYS reserved table name. When VALUE is set to %_FIX%,
        ANSYS will prescribe the degree of freedom to the "current" relative
        displacement value. This option is only valid for the following labels:
        UX, UY, UZ, ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ. Alternatively, functions UX(), UY(), etc.
        may be used (see ``*GET`` for a complete list of available functions). In
        most cases, %_FIX% usage is efficient and recommended for all
        structural degrees of freedom.

        When Value = SUPPORT, specify only the minimum number of displacement
        constraints necessary to prevent rigid body motion: three constraints
        (or fewer, depending on the element type) for 2-D models and six (or
        fewer) for 3-D models.

        If constraints and initial conditions (IC) are applied at the same
        node, the constraint specification overrides. This combination is
        useful when a constraint degree-of-freedom value needs to start with a
        nonzero value at time = 0.0. For example, if the constraint degree-of-
        freedom value is prescribed to be a cosine function, then specifying an
        initial condition for the same node and degree of freedom ensures that
        the initial value for the constraint degree of freedom at time = 0.0 is
        same as the cosine function evaluated at time = 0.0. If initial
        conditions are not specified, the constraint degree-of-freedom value
        ramps from zero in the first substep of the first loadstep.

        If more than one rotational degrees of freedom are constrained with
        non-zero rotations (ROTX, ROTY, ROTZ), rotational velocities (OMGX,
        OMGY, OMGZ), or rotational accelerations (DMGX, DMGY, DMGZ), then the
        rotation of the constrained node from its initial configuration to its
        final configuration depends on the combination and the sequence in
        which the constraints are applied. See Rotations in a Large-Deflection
        Analysis in Structural Analysis Guide.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

            1.0.  Use a small number for a zero scale factor.

        ifact
            Scale factor for the imaginary component.  Zero (or blank) defaults

        tbase
            Base temperature for temperature difference.  Used only with

            temperature difference (T-TBASE) and then added to TBASE.  T is the
            current temperature.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows repeated degree of freedom constraint values (displacement,
        temperature, etc.)  to be replaced, added, or ignored.  Operations
        apply to the selected nodes [NSEL] and the selected degree of freedom
        labels [DOFSEL]. This command also operates on velocity and
        acceleration loads applied in a structural analysis.

        The operations occur when the next degree of freedom constraints are
        defined.  For example, issuing the command D,1,UX,.025 after a previous
        D,1,UX,.020 causes the new value of the displacement on node 1 in the
        x-direction to be 0.045 with the add operation, 0.025 with the replace
        operation, or 0.020 with the ignore operation.  Scale factors are also
        available to multiply the next value before the add or replace
        operation.  A scale factor of 2.0 with the previous "add" example
        results in a displacement of 0.070.  Scale factors are applied even if
        no previous values exist.  Issue DCUM,STAT to show the current label,
        operation, and scale factors.  Solid model boundary conditions are not
        affected by this command, but boundary conditions on the FE model are
        affected.

        Note:: : FE boundary conditions may still be overwritten by existing
        solid model boundary conditions if a subsequent boundary condition
        transfer occurs.

        freedom to produce a uniform magnetic flux B in an edge-based
        electromagnetic analysis using elements SOLID236 and SOLID237. The
        command ignores the corner nodes of the elements (even if they were
        selected) and imposes the AZ-constraints on the mid-side nodes only.
        The AZ-constraints are imposed in the active Cartesian coordinate
        system. A non-Cartesian coordinate system will be ignored by the DFLX
        command.

        The edge-flux constraints at the mid-side nodes are derived from  the
        magnetic vector potential A, which is related to the imposed magnetic
        flux B as follows:

        where r is the position of the mid-side node.

            X - Surface is normal to coordinate X direction (default).  Interpreted as R
                direction for non-Cartesian coordinate systems.

            Y - Surface is normal to coordinate Y direction.   θ direction for non-Cartesian
                coordinate systems.

        -----
        Specifies symmetry or antisymmetry degree-of-freedom constraints on the
        selected nodes. The nodes are first automatically rotated (any
        previously defined rotations on these nodes are redefined) into
        coordinate system KCN, then zero-valued constraints are generated, as
        described below, on the selected degree-of-freedom set (limited to
        displacement, velocity, and magnetic degrees of freedom) [DOFSEL].
        Constraints are defined in the (rotated) nodal coordinate system, as
        usual. See the D and NROTAT commands for additional details about
        constraints and nodal rotations.

        This command is also valid in PREP7.

        Symmetry or antisymmetry constraint generations are based upon the
        valid degrees of freedom in the model, i.e., the degrees of freedom
        associated with the elements attached to the nodes.  The labels for
        degrees of freedom used in the generation depend on the Normal label.

        For displacement degrees of freedom, the constraints generated are:

        For velocity degrees of freedom, the constraints generated are:

        For magnetic degrees of freedom, the SYMM label generates flux normal
        conditions (flux flows normal to the surface).  Where no constraints
        are generated, the flux normal condition is "naturally" satisfied.  The
        ASYM label generates flux parallel conditions (flux flows parallel to
        the surface).

        -----
        In a mode-superposition harmonic or transient analysis, you can apply
        enforced displacement or acceleration loads. If multiple loads are
        specified for the same base identification number (BaseID), the last
        load applied overrides the previous ones. For example, the following
        commands apply displacement to the base with identification number 1:

        In this case, the acceleration (ACC) applied in the last command will
        override the displacement (U).
