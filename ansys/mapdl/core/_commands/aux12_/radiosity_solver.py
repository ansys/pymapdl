        fluxtol
            Convergence tolerance for radiation flux. Defaults to 0.0001. This
            value is a relative tolerance.

        solver
            Choice of solver for radiosity calculation:

            0 - Gauss-Seidel iterative solver (default).

            1 - Direct solver.

            2 - Jacobi solver.

        maxiter
            Maximum number of iterations for iterative solver (SOLVER = 0 or
            2). Defaults to 1000.

        toler
            Convergence tolerance for the iterative solver (SOLVER = 0 or 2).
            Defaults to 0.1.

        overrlex
            Over-relaxation factor applied to the iterative solver (SOLVER = 0
            or 2). Defaults to 0.1.

        maxfluxiter
            Maximum number of flux iterations to be performed according to the
            specified solver type:

            0 - If the FULL solver is specified (THOPT,FULL), convergence criteria are
                monitored and iterations are performed until convergence
                occurs. If the QUASI solver is specified (THOPT,QUASI),
                convergence criteria are ignored and one iteration is
                performed. This value is the default.

            1, 2, 3, ...N  - If the FULL solver is specified
                             (THOPT,FULL), convergence criteria are
                             monitored and iterations are performed
                             until convergence occurs, or until the
                             specified number of iterations has been
                             completed, whichever comes first. If the
                             QUASI solver is specified (THOPT,QUASI),
                             convergence criteria are ignored and the
                             specified number of iterations are
                             completed.

        Notes
        -----
        The radiation heat flux is linearized, resulting in robust convergence.

        The radiation flux norm for FLUXTOL is expressed as:

        where i is the pass or iteration number and j is the surface facet for
        radiation.

        For a sufficiently small absolute tolerance value, relative tolerance
        converges in fewer iterations than absolute tolerance. For a
        sufficiently large absolute tolerance value, relative tolerance may
        cause convergence difficulties.

        For more information about FLUXTOL and MAXFLUXITER usage, see Figure:
        3.5:: FULL Solution Method When Radiosity Is Present and Figure: 3.6::
        QUASI Solution Method When Radiosity Is Present in the Thermal Analysis
        Guide.

        The Jacobi solver (SOLVER = 2) is suitable when using Distributed
        ANSYS. This option is only available for 3-D models; if SOLVER is set
        to 2 for a 2-D analysis, the Gauss-Seidel iterative solver (SOLVER = 0)
        is used.

            Option key:

            0 - The view factor matrix values are not adjusted (default).

            2 - The view factor matrix values are adjusted so that the
                row sum equals 1.0 and the reciprocity relationship is
                satisfied.

            3 - The view factor matrix values are adjusted so that the

            Maximum number of iterations to achieve convergence. Valid only
            when OPT = 2 or 4. Default is 100.

        conv
            Convergence value for row sum. Iterations will continue (up to
