        APDL Command: A

        Keypoints (P1 through P18) must be input in a clockwise or
        counterclockwise order around the area.  This order also
        determines the positive normal direction of the area according
        to the right-hand rule.  Existing lines between adjacent
        keypoints will be used; missing lines are generated "straight"
        in the active coordinate system and assigned the lowest
        available numbers [NUMSTR].  If more than one line exists
        between two keypoints, the shorter one will be chosen.  If the
        area is to be defined with more than four keypoints, the
        required keypoints and lines must lie on a constant coordinate
        value in the active coordinate system (such as a plane or a
        cylinder).  Areas may be redefined only if not yet attached to
        a volume.  Solid modeling in a toroidal coordinate system is
        not recommended.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p1, p2, p3, . . . , p18
            List of keypoints defining the area (18 maximum if using

        int
            The area number of the generated area.

        APDL Command: ADRAG

        Generates areas (and their corresponding keypoints and lines)
        by sweeping a given line pattern along a characteristic drag
        path.  If the drag path consists of multiple lines, the drag
        direction is determined by the sequence in which the path
        lines are input (NLP1, NLP2, etc.).  If the drag path is a
        single line (NLP1), the drag direction is from the keypoint on
        the drag line that is closest to the first keypoint of the
        given line pattern to the other end of the drag line.

        The magnitude of the vector between the keypoints of the given
        pattern and the first path keypoint remains constant for all
        generated keypoint patterns and the path keypoints.  The
        direction of the vector relative to the path slope also
        remains constant so that patterns may be swept around curves.

        Keypoint, line, and area numbers are automatically assigned
        (beginning with the lowest available values [NUMSTR]).
        Adjacent lines use a common keypoint.  Adjacent areas use a
        common line.  For best results, the entities to be dragged
        should be orthogonal to the start of the drag path.  Drag
        operations that produce an error message may create some of

        ----------
        nl1, nl2, nl3, . . . , nl6
            List of lines in the pattern to be dragged (6 maximum if

            that define the drag path) will be swept along the path.
            A component name may also be substituted for NL1.

        nlp1, nlp2, nlp3, . . . , nlp6

            Algorithm" below).

        Notes
        -----
        Generates an area by "skinning" a surface through specified guiding
        lines.  The lines act as a set of "ribs" over which a surface is
        "stretched."  Two opposite edges of the area are framed by the first
        (NL1) and last (NLn) guiding lines specified.  The other two edges of
        the area are framed by splines-fit lines which the program
        automatically generates through the ends of all guiding lines.  The
        interior of the area is shaped by the interior guiding lines.  Once the
        area has been created, only the four edge lines will be attached to it.
        In rare cases, it may be necessary to change the default algorithm used
        by the ASKIN command (see "Changing the ASKIN Algorithm" below).

        When skinning from one guiding line to the next, the program can create
        the transition area in one of two ways:  one more spiraled and one less
        spiraled ("flatter").  By default, the program attempts to produce the
        flatter transition, instead of the more spiraled transition.  This
        algorithm can be changed by inputting NL1 as a negative number, in
        which case the program connects all the keypoints at the line
        "beginnings" (/PSYMB,LDIR command) as one edge of the area, and all the
        line "ends" as the opposite edge, irrespective of the amount of
        spiraling produced in each transition area.

        To further control the geometry of the area (if NL1 is negative), the
        beginning and end of any specified line (other than NL1) can be
        temporarily interchanged (for the skinning operation only) by inputting
        that line number as negative.  See Solid Modeling in the Modeling and
        Meshing Guide for an illustration.

        ASUM should only be used on perfectly flat areas.

        Geometry items are reported in the global Cartesian coordinate system.
        A unit thickness is assumed unless the areas have a non-zero total
        thickness defined by real constant or section data.

        For layered areas, a unit density is always assumed. For single-layer
        areas, a unit density is assumed unless the areas have a valid material
        (density).

        The thickness and density are associated to the areas via the AATT

        Items calculated via ASUM and later retrieved via a ``*GET`` or ``*VGET``
        command are valid only if the model is not modified after issuing the

        Setting a finer degree of tessellation will provide area calculations
        with greater accuracy, especially for thin, hollow models.  However,
        using a finer degree of tessellation requires longer processing.

        For very narrow (sliver) areas, such that the ratio of the minimum to
        the maximum dimension is less than 0.01, the ASUM command can provide
        erroneous area information.  To ensure that the calculations are

        recommended.  Coordinate and slope values are interpreted in the active
        coordinate system and are transferred directly.  Areas are generated as
        described in the AGEN command.

        Calculates and prints geometry items (centroid location, moments of
        inertia, length, area, volume etc.) associated with the selected
        keypoints, lines, areas, and volumes. Geometry items are reported in
        the global Cartesian coordinate system.   For volumes, a unit density
        is assumed unless the volumes have a material association via the VATT
        command.  For areas, a unit density (and thickness) is assumed unless
        the areas have a material (and real constant) association via the AATT
        command.  For lines and keypoints, a unit density is assumed,
        irrespective of any material associations [LATT, KATT, MAT].  Items
        calculated by GSUM and later retrieved by a ``*GET`` or ``*VGET`` commands are
        valid only if the model is not modified after the GSUM command is
        issued.  This command combines the functions of the KSUM, LSUM, ASUM,
        and VSUM commands.

        na1
            Starting area for display of areas and underlying surfaces. If NA1

            are displayed (ASEL command).

            Last area to be displayed.

        ninc
            Numeric value setting steps between NA1 and NA2 for display.
            Default value is (1).

        mesh
            Specifies a rectangular mesh density used to display the underlying
            surface (default 4, i.e. 4 x 4).

        Use APLOT for trimmed surface display.
