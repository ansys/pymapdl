        Notes
        -----
        The AEROCOEFF command is designed to generate an array of
        aerodynamic coefficients that can be used in a cyclic
        mode-superposition harmonic response analysis using the CYCFREQ
        , AERO command to represent aerodynamic stiffness and
        damping. These aerodynamic coefficients can also be used in a damped
        modal analysis phase (CYCFREQ, MODAL) of a cyclic
        mode-superposition harmonic solve. An APDL array called
        JobnameAeroArray is generated using the AEROCOEFF command.  This array
        is compatible with the array needed for the CYCFREQ, AERO command.
        The format of the written array follows that of the CYCFREQ, AERO
        command. The array is formatted as follows:
        ``i, m, n, V_real, V_imag``

        where
        ``i`` = the i th interblade phase angle (IBPA)
        ``m`` = the m th vibrating blade mode
        ``n`` = the n th blade mode generating the pressure oscillations

        ``Vreal`` and ``V_imag`` = the real and imaginary coefficients.

        Prior to issuing the AEROCOEFF command, a non-cyclic cantilevered
        blade modal analysis must be run, either stress-free or
        prestressed using linear perturbation. For more information, see
        Modal Analysis in the Structural Analysis Guide. The file
        requirements for the AEROCOEFF command are the same as those
        needed for modal restart as described in Modal Analysis Restart.
        The AeroSpecs values are specified in a 3Ã—r array ``*DIM``,
        where r is a positive integer equal to the number of interblade
        phase angles and the pressure modes solved for in the CFD
        analysis.

        Each row has the structure: ``i, m, n``
        where
        ``i`` = the i th interblade phase angle (IBPA)
        ``m`` = the m th vibrating blade mode
        ``n`` = the n th blade mode generating the pressure oscillations

        At least one aerodynamic damping coefficient must be specified for
        each IBPA (equal to the number of blades) while keeping and
        constant. If a value is not specified, the program writes an array
        value of zero for both and . The values of and are relative to the
        modes computed in the re- quired modal analysis.

        The number of AeroScalar values must be equal to the number of
        pressure modes ( from Aero- Specs). If the number of AeroScalar
        values is greater than 1, the values must be entered by defining
        an array ``*DIM`` and entering the array name in the AeroScalar
        field. For a discussion of how AeroScalar values are computed, see
        Scaling Aerodynamic Coupling Coefficients.

        The value for nBlades should be equal to the number of sectors of
        the system. If there are multiple blades per cyclic sector, then
        the combination of blades on the single sector will have an aero
        coefficient value. In this case, each blade will not have a
        distinct aero coefficient.

        Notes
        -----
        The program solves a cyclically symmetric model (set up via the CYCLIC
        command during preprocessing) at the harmonic indices specified via the
        CYCOPT command.

        The aerodynamic coefficients are specified in a 5Ã—(NÃ—r) array (``*DIM``),
        where N is the number of blades and r can be any positive integer. Each
        column has the structure:

        where:

        One aerodynamic damping coefficient must be specified for each IBPA
        (equal to the number of blades) while keeping m and n constant.

        For constant (frequency-independent) mistuning, the stiffness
        parameters are specified in an NÃ—1 array (``*DIM``) where N is the number
        of blades.

        For stiffness mistuning, each row entry represents the deviation of
        Youngâ€™s modulus from nominal,  (or equivalently, the ratio of the
        frequency deviation squared). Each frequency can also be independently
        mistuned, in which case the array is NÃ—M, where M is the number of
        blade frequencies (Value3 of CYCFREQ,BLADE). The entries in each row
        therefore correspond to the ratio of the mistuned frequency to the
        tuned frequency squared minus one:

        The USER option activates the solution macro CYCMSUPUSERSOLVE.MAC. The
        normal solution is skipped. You may implement your own mistuning
        solution using APDL and APDL Math operations, or call your own program
        for the solution.

        The CYCFREQ command is valid in the preprocessing and solution stages
        of an analysis.

        The CYCFREQ,MODAL,ON command writes modal frequencies to the output
        file. No other postprocessing is available for this modal solve.

        When using CYCFREQ,RESTART, only mistuning parameters or frequency
        range may be changed. All other changes in parameters are ignored.

        APDL Command: CYCLIC

        Parameters
        ----------
        nsector
            The number of sectors in the full 360 degrees, or one of the
            following options:

            STATUS - Indicates the current cyclic status.

            OFF - Resets model to normal (non-cyclic) status and removes the duplicate sector if
                  it exists. This option also deletes automatically detected
                  edge components (generated when USRCOMP = 0).

            UNDOUBLE - Removes the duplicate sector if it exists. The duplicate sector is created
                       during the solution (SOLVE) stage of a modal cyclic
                       symmetry analysis.

        angle
            The sector angle in degrees.

        kcn
            An arbitrary reference number assigned to the cyclic coordinate
            system.  The default value of 0 specifies automatic detection.

        name
            The root name of sector low- and high-edge components (line, area,
            or node components). The default root name (when USRCOMP = 0) is
            "CYCLIC". A root name that you specify can contain up to 11
            characters.

        usrcomp
            The number of pairs of user-defined low- and high-edge components
            on the cyclic sector (if any). The default value of 0 specifies
            automatic detection of sector edges; however, the automatic setting
            is not valid in all cases. (For more information, see the Notes
            section below.) If the value is greater than 0, no verification of
            user-defined components occurs.

        usrnmap
            The name of a user-defined array specifying the matching node pairs
            between the sector low and high edges. Valid only when USRCOMP = 0.
            Skips the automatic detection of sector edges. Node pairs may be
            input in any order, but the low edge node must be the first entry
            in each pair.

        Notes
        -----
        You can input your own value for NSECTOR, ANGLE or KCN; if you do so,
        the command verifies argument values before executing.

        When USRCOMP = 0 and USRNMAP = blank (default), the CYCLIC command
        automatically detects low- and high-edge components for models
        comprised of any combination of line, area, or volume elements. If a
        solid model exists, however, the  command uses only the lines, areas,
        and/or volumes to determine the  low- and high-edge components; the
        elements, if any, are ignored.

        Nodes will be automatically rotated unless CYCOPT,USERROT,YES has been
        specified.

        If you issue a CYCOPT,TOLER command to set a tolerance for edge-
        component pairing before issuing the CYCLIC command, the CYCLIC command
        uses the specified tolerance when performing automatic edge-component
        detection.

        For 2-D models, autodetection does not consider the CSYS,5 or CSYS,6
        coordinate system specification.  Autodetection for 180 degree (two-
        sector) models is not possible unless a central hole exists.

        The CYCLIC command sets values and keys so that, if possible, the area-
        mesh (AMESH) or volume-mesh (VMESH) command meshes the sector with
        matching node and element face patterns on the low and high edges. (The
        command has no effect on any other element-creation command.)

        Issue the CYCLIC command prior to the meshing command to, if possible,
        produce a mesh with identical node and element patterns on the low and
        high sector edges. Only the AMESH or VMESH commands can perform
        automated matching. (Other meshing operation commands such as VSWEEP
        cannot.) If you employ a meshing operation other than AMESH or VMESH,
        you should ensure that node and element face patterns match, if
        desired. The CYCLIC command output indicates whether each edge-
        component pair has or can produce a matching node pair.

        A cyclic solution (via the SOLVE command) allows dissimilar mesh
        patterns on the extreme boundaries of a cyclically symmetric model. The
        allowance for dissimilar patterns is useful when you have only finite-
        element meshes for your model but not the geometry data necessary to
        remesh it to obtain identical node patterns. In such cases, it is
        possible to obtain solution results, although perhaps at the expense of
        accuracy. A warning message appears because results may be degraded
        near the sector edges.

        The constraint equations (CEs) that tie together the low and high edges
        of your model are generated at the solution stage of the analysis from
        the low- and high-edge components (and nowhere else). You should verify
        that automatically detected components are in the correct  locations
        and that you can account for all components; to do so, you can list
        (CMLIST) or plot (CMPLOT) the components.

        If you issue the CYCLIC command after meshing and have defined element
        types with rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs), ANSYS generates cyclic
        CEs for rotational DOFs that may not exist on the sector boundaries.
        Issue the CYCOPT,DOF command to prevent unused rotational terms from
        being generated.

        Modal cyclic symmetry analysis is supported by the following
        eigensolvers:

        Block Lanczos (MODOPT,LANB)

        PCG Lanczos (MODOPT,LANPCG)

        Super Node (MODOPT,SNODE)

        Subspace (MODOPT,SUBSP)

        When using the: CYCLIC: command to automatically detect the sector, if
        an area is defined with the: AL: command, the lines need to be oriented
        to form the closed curve.

            One of the following options:

            BCMULT - Controls whether cyclic sector array parameter names are reused or created new
                     for multiple entities.

            COMBINE - For linear static cyclic symmetry analysis with non-cyclically symmetric
                      loading only, expands and combines all harmonic index
                      solutions and writes them to the results file during the

            1 (ON or YES) - Enable combining of harmonic index solutions

            DEFAULT - Set the default cyclic solution settings.

            DOF - The degrees of freedom to couple from the nodes on the low sector boundary to
                  nodes on the high boundary:

            Value1 - The component pair ID number.

            Value2, Value3, Value4,  . . . ,  Value7 - The constraint-equation/-coupling degree of freedom (DOF) for this pair. Repeat
                              the command to add other DOFs. The default is
                              constraint-equation/-coupling all applicable
                              DOFs.

            FACETOL - Tolerance for inclusion of surface nodes into your basic sector. Autodetect
                      defaults to 15Â°, accommodating most sections. Specify a
                      new Value1 only when extreme cut angles or complex model
                      geometry cause surface nodes to be excluded. See Notes
                      (below) for more information.

            ANSYS, Inc. recommends that successful auto-detection depends more on the value of ANGTOL than the value of FACETOL. Please refer to CYCOPT Auto Detection Tolerance Adjustments for Difficult Cases for more information about auto-detection and the CYCOPT command. - Value1

            The face tolerance applies only to auto detection from node/element models (already meshed and no solid model), and it defaults to 15Â°.   - HINDEX

            The harmonic index solution ranges for modal or buckling cyclic symmetry analyses. The SOLVE command initiates a cyclic symmetry solution sequence at the harmonic indices specified. (By default, the SOLVE command solves for all available harmonic indices.) Static and harmonic cyclic symmetry solutions always use all harmonic indices required for the applied loads. - EVEN / ODD

            For low-frequency electromagnetic analysis only, EVEN specifies a symmetric solution and ODD specifies an antisymmetric solution.  - The value you specify is based on the harmonic index: EVEN (default) indicates
                              harmonic index = 0, and ODD indicates harmonic
                              index = N / 2 (where N is an integer representing

                              applies only when N is an even number.

            The CYCOPT command with this HINDEX option is cumulative. To remove an option (for example, EVEN), issue this command: CYCOPT,HINDEX,EVEN,,,-1 - ALL

            Solve all applicable harmonic indices. - Note:  Value2 must be blank.

            Value1, Value2, Value3 - Solve harmonic indices in range Value1 through Value2 in steps of Value3.
                              Repeat the command to add other ranges. The
                              default solves all applicable harmonic indices.

            Value4 - The only valid value is -1. If specified, it removes Value1 through Value2 in
                     steps of Value3 from the set to solve. By default, if
                     Value4 = -1 then Value1 = 0, Value2 = 0, and Value3 = 1.

            Value5 - For static and harmonic analyses, the tolerance for determining if a Fourier
                     contribution of a load contributes to the response
                     (default = 1.0E-5).

            If Value5=STATIC, it forces the program to solve only the specified harmonic indices (even if a load may have a Fourier contribution in an index not specified). - LDSECT

            Restricts subsequently defined force loads and surface loads to a specified sector. The restriction remains in effect until you change or reset it. This option is not available for harmonic analyses based on mode-superposition (CYCOPT,MSUP,1) - Value1

            The sector number. A value other than 0 (default) is valid for a cyclic symmetry analysis with non-cyclically symmetric loading only. A value of 0 (or ALL) resets the default behavior for cyclic loading (where the loads are identical on all sectors). - MOVE

            Specifies if the program should move high- or low-edge component nodes paired within the specified tolerance (TOLER) to create precisely matching pairs.  - Value1

            The flag value. - 0

            Do not move edge component nodes (default) - 1 or HIGH

            Move the high-edge component nodes to precisely match the low-edge component nodes - -1 or LOW

            Move the low-edge component nodes to precisely match the high-edge component nodes - MSUP

            For modal cyclic symmetry analysis only, this flag is used to limit the results written to the Jobname.MODE and Jobname.RST files in preparation for a subsequent mode-superposition-based analysis. In a linear perturbation modal analysis, this option must be specified in the first load step of the preceding base analysis.  - m"""

            Cartesian coordinate system [CSYS,0] location in the X or Y
            direction respectively.  For PLNOPT = 0, the location is the angle
            in the global cylindrical coordinate system [CSYS,1].

            Cartesian coordinate system [CSYS,0] location in the X or Y
            direction respectively.  For PLNOPT = 0, the location is the angle
            (in degrees) in the global cylindrical coordinate system [CSYS,1].

        loctol
            Tolerance on the constant coordinate location for node selection.
            Defaults to .00001 for PLNOPT  = 1 or 2 and .001 degrees for PLNOPT
            = 0.

        r1
            Minimum coordinate location along the second plane of nodes.  For
            PLNOPT = 1 or 2, the coordinate location is the global Cartesian
            coordinate system location in the Y or X direction respectively.
            For PLNOPT = 0, the coordinate location is the radial coordinate
            value in the global cylindrical coordinate system.   Periodic
            conditions are not applied to nodes at this location.

        r2
            Maximum coordinate location along the second plane of nodes.  For

            coordinate system location in the Y or X direction respectively.
            For PLNOPT = 0, the coordinate location is the radial coordinate

            2 - Planes parallel to the global Cartesian Y axis [CSYS,0].

        Notes
        -----
        PERBC2D invokes an ANSYS macro which generates periodic boundary
        condition constraints for 2-D planar magnetic field analysis.  The
        macro is restricted to node pairs sharing common coordinate values
        along symmetry planes separated by a constant coordinate value.  Planes
        (or lines) must lie at either constant  angles (PLNOPT = 0), constant X
        values (PLNOPT = 1), or constant Y values (PLNOPT = 2).  PERBC2D
        applies constraint equations (OPT = 0, odd symmetry) or node coupling
        (OPT = 1, even symmetry) to each node pair sharing a common coordinate
        value along the symmetry planes.  By default, periodic conditions are
        not applied at the first and last node pairs on the symmetry planes
        unless the input location values, R1 and R2, are adjusted to be less
        than or greater than the actual node coordinate values.  Nodes are
        selected for application of the constraints using the NSEL command with
        tolerances on the constant coordinate location (LOCTOL) and the
        coordinate location along the plane (RTOL).

                   arguments.

            DELETE - Deletes a specified physics file and its title
                     from the database.

            CLEAR - Deletes all material properties, solution options,
                    load step options, constraint equations, coupled
                    nodes, results, and GUI preference settings from

            STATUS - Displays information about all active elements
                     and settings.

        title
            A user-defined title that quickly identifies a set of
            physics settings.  For example, you might use "Fluid,"
            "Structural," or "Magnetic" as titles.  A title can
            contain up to 64 characters. It can be entered in lower or
            upper case. Lower case is internally converted to upper
            case within the program.

        fname
            File name and directory path (248 characters maximum,
            including the characters needed for the directory path).
            An unspecified directory path defaults to the working
            directory; in this case, you can use all 248 characters
            for the file name.

        ext
            Filename extension (eight-character maximum).

        Notes
        -----
        Use the PHYSICS command when you are performing a multiphysics
        analysis that involves two different disciplines (for example,
        magnetic and structural analyses) and you cannot solve both
        analyses simultaneously.  Once you have set up physics
        environments for both analyses, you can use the PHYSICS,READ
        command to change between the defined physics environments.
        For more information about doing multiphysics analyses, see
        Sequential Coupled-Field Analysis in the Coupled-Field
        Analysis Guide.

        The PHYSICS command outputs all solution information,
        including analysis options, to the Jobname.PHn file described
        above.  Although it also outputs components, the ANSYS program
        does not list entities (nodes, elements, lines, etc.).

        PHYSICS,WRITE will overwrite existing physics files with the
        same title (even if the name is different). In other words, if
        the directory has a physics file with the same title as the
        active physics file title, but a different name, the
        PHYSICS,WRITE command will overwrite the existing physics file
        and use the existing filename, not the filename specified on
