        APDL Command: HPTCREATE

        Parameters
        ----------
        type\_
            Type of entity on which the hard point will be created.

            LINE - Hard point will be created on a line.

            AREA - Hard point will be created within an area (not on the boundaries).

        entity
            Number of the line or area on which the hard point will be created.

        nhp
            Number assigned to the hard point.  Defaults to the lowest
            available hard point number.

        label
            If LABEL = COORD, VAL1, VAL2, and VAL3 are the respective global X,
            Y, and Z coordinates.  If LABEL = RATIO, VAL1 is the parameter
            value (this is available only for lines).  Valid parameter values
            are between 0 and 1.  VAL2 and VAL3 are ignored.

        val1
            If LABEL = RATIO, ratio value for line.  If LABEL = COORD, global X
            coordinate value.

        val2
            If LABEL = COORD, global Y coordinate value.

        val3
            If LABEL = COORD, global Z coordinate value.

        Notes
        -----
        The ability to enter a parameter value provides a simple way of
        positioning hard points on lines.  For example, to place a hard point
        halfway along a line, one can simply specify a VAL1 value of 0.5.

        For models imported through the DEFAULT IGES filter, you can place hard
        points on models only by specifying coordinates (you can't place a hard
        point using interactive picking).

        If you issue any commands that update the geometry of an entity, such
        as Boolean or simplification commands, any hard points associated with
        that entity are deleted.  Therefore, you should add any hard points
        after completing the solid model.  If you delete an entity that has
        associated hard points, those hard points are either

        Deleted along with the entity (if the hard point is not associated with
        any other entities).

        Detached from the deleted entity (if the hard point is associated with
        additional entities).

        When archiving your model (CDWRITE), hardpoint information cannot be
        written to the IGES file. The Jobname.cdb file can be written with the
        CDWRITE,DB option.

        Hard points are only applicable for area and volume meshing, not for
        beams.

        Parameters
        ----------
        np1, np2, ninc
            Delete the pattern of hard points beginning with NP1 to NP2 in
            steps of NINC (defaults to 1).  If NP1 = ALL, NP2 and NINC are
            ignored and the pattern is all selected hard points [KSEL].  If NP1
            = P, graphical picking is enabled and all remaining command fields
            are ignored.

        Notes
        -----
        Deletes all attributes attached to the designated hard points as well
        as the hard points themselves.  If any entity is attached to a
        designated hard point, the command detaches the hard point from that
        entity (the program will alert you that this will occur).
