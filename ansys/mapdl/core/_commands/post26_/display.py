        Parameters
        ----------
        key
            State or value

            On or 1  - Allows you to exit and reenter /POST26 without losing your current time history
                       variable information. Keeps a cache of the /POST26
                       variable information including the active file name
                       (FILE),  variable definitions (NSOL, ESOL, GAPF, RFORCE,
                       SOLU, and EDREAD) and stored variable data in memory for
                       the current ANSYS session.

            Off or 0  - /POST26 variable information is deleted when you exit /POST26.

        Notes
        -----
        Your variable information is saved in memory only for the current
        active ANSYS session. It is deleted when you exit ANSYS. This
        information is also deleted when you issue /CLEAR, RESUME, SOLVE, or
        RESET.

        When you reenter /POST26 all time history variable data is available
        for use. When you issue STORE,NEW, variable definitions created by math
        operations such as ADD or PROD will not be restored. However, variables
        defined with NSOL, ESOL, GAPF, RFORCE, SOLU, and EDREAD will be
        restored. Only the last active results file name is kept in memory
        (FILE).

        Commands such as LAYERP26, SHELL, and FORCE that specify the location
        or a component of data to be stored will retain the setting at the time
        of exiting /POST26 .
