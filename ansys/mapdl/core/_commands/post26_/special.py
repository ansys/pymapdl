        This command computes the covariance value for the variables referenced

        referenced by IR will contain the individual modal contributions (i.e.,
        the dynamic or relative values).  If DATUM = 1, the variable referenced
        by IR will contain the modal contributions followed by the
        contributions of pseudo-static and covariance between dynamic and
        pseudo-static responses. File.PSD must be available for the
        calculations to occur.

        summarized by element components and listed on the screen as well as
        written to a file (Fname.OUT).  Also, graph plots of results as a

        lftab
            Reference number of variable containing frequency table (created
            with FILLDATA or DATA command).  The frequency table defines the
            number and frequency of oscillating systems used to determine the
            response spectrum. The frequency interval need not be constant over
            the entire range. Frequencies must be input in ascending order.

        ldtab
            Reference number of variable containing the input time-history.

        spectype
            Defines the type of response spectrum to be calculated:

            0 or 1 - Displacement (relative to base excitation)

            2 - Velocity (relative to base excitation)

            3 - Acceleration response spectrum (absolute)

            4 - Pseudo-velocity

            5 - Pseudo-acceleration

        dampratio
            Ratio of viscous damping to critical damping (input as a decimal
            number).

        dtime
            Integration time step. This value should be equal to or greater
            than the integration time step used in the initial transient
            analysis performed to generate the input time-history (LDTAB).

        tmin, tmax
            Specifies a subset of the displacement-time history to be used in
            the response spectrum calculation.  Defaults to the full time
            range.

        inputtype
            Defines the type of the input time-history:

            0 - Displacement (default)

            1 - Acceleration

        Notes
        -----
        This command generates a response spectrum from a displacement or
        acceleration time-history and frequency data. The response spectrum is
        defined as the maximum response of single degree of freedom systems of
        varying frequency (or period) to a given input support excitation.

        A response spectrum analysis (ANTYPE, SPECTR with SPOPT, SPRS or MPRS)
        requires a response spectrum input. This input can be determined from
        the response spectrum printout or display of this command.

        If a response spectrum is to be calculated from a given displacement
        (or acceleration) time-history, the displacement time-history may be
        input to a single one-element reduced linear transient dynamic
        (ANTYPE,TRANS) analysis, so that the calculated output (which should be
        the same as the input) will be properly located on the file.

        The integration time step (argument DTIME on the RESP command) and the
        damping coefficient (argument dampRatio) are constant over the
        frequency range. The number of calculations done per response spectrum
        curve is the product of the number of input solution points (TMAX-
        TMIN)/DTIME and the number of frequency points (frequencies located in
        variable LFTAB).

        Input solution points requested (using DTIME and the frequency range)
        at a time not corresponding to an actual displacement solution time on
        the file are linearly interpolated with respect to the existing points.

            Must be the same length as the first vector. You must create and

        datap
            Number of data points to be fitted, starting from the beginning of
            the vector. If left blank, the entire vector will be fitted. The
            maximum number of data points is 100,000 (or greater, depending on
            the memory of the computer).

        fitpt
            Order of the fitting curve that will be used as a smooth
            representation of the data. This number should be less than or
            equal to the number of the data points. Default (blank) is one-half
            the number of data points. Maximum number of smoothed data fitting
            order is the number of data points up to 50.  Depending on this
            number, the smoothed curve will be one of the following:

            1 - Curve is the absolute average of all of the data points.

            2 - Curve is the least square average of all of the data points.

            3 or more - Curve is a polynomial of the order (n-1), where n is the number of data fitting
                        order points.

        vect3
            Name of the vector that contains the smoothed data of the

            greater than the number of smoothed data points. In batch (command)
            mode, you must create this vector before issuing the SMOOTH
            command. In interactive mode, the GUI automatically creates this

            Name of the vector that contains the smoothed data of the dependent

        -----
        You can control the attributes of the graph using standard ANSYS
        controls (/GRID, /GTHK, /COLOR, etc.). If working interactively, these
        controls appear in this dialog box for convenience, as well as in their
        standard dialog boxes. You must always create Vect1 and Vect2 (using
        ``*DIM``) and fill these vectors before smoothing the data. If you're

        if you're working in batch (command) mode, you must create Vect3 and
        Vect4 (using ``*DIM``) before issuing SMOOTH.  Vect3 and Vect4 are then
        filled automatically by ANSYS.  In addition, ANSYS creates an
        additional TABLE type array that contains the smoothed array and the
        unsmoothed data to allow for plotting later with ``*VPLOT``.  Column 1 in
        this table corresponds to Vect1, column 2 to Vect2, and column 3 to
