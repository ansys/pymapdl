        with harmonic analyses (ANTYPE,HARMIC).

        Complex variables are stored in two-column arrays with the
        real component stored in the first column and the imaginary
        component stored in the second column.  This command extracts
        the value stored in the first column (i.e., real component).
        However with harmonic analyses, all variables are stored in
        two-column arrays as complex variables.  If the variable is
        not complex, then the same value is stored in both columns.
        This command will extract the variable in the first column of
        the array, even if this variable is not the real component of
        a complex variable.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ir
            Arbitrary reference number assigned to the resulting
            variable (2 to NV [NUMVAR]).  If this number is the same
            as for a previously defined variable, the previously

        ia, ib, ic
            Reference numbers of the three variables to be operated
            on.  If only two, leave IC blank.  If only one, leave IB
            blank also.

        name
            Thirty-two character name identifying the variable on
            printouts and displays.  Embedded blanks are compressed
            for output.

        facta, factb, factc
            Scaling factors (positive or negative) applied to the
            corresponding variables (defaults to 1.0).
