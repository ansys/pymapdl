        val1, val2, val3, . . . , val8
            Numeric or alphanumeric character values to be included in message.
            Values may be the results of parameter evaluations.  All numeric
            values are assumed to be double precision. The FORTRAN nearest
            integer (NINT) function is used to form integers for the %I
            specifier.

        Notes
        -----
        Allows writing an output message via the ANSYS message subroutine.
        Also allows run termination control.  This command is used only when
        contained in a prepared file read into the ANSYS program (i.e.,
        ``*USE,/INPUT``, etc.).  A message format must immediately follow the ``*MSG``
        command (on a separate line, without parentheses, as described below).

        The message format may be up to 80 characters long, consisting of text
        strings and predefined "data descriptors" between the strings where
        numeric or alphanumeric character data are to be inserted.  The normal
        descriptors are %I for integer data, %G for double precision data, %C
        for alphanumeric character data, and %/ for a line break.  The
        corresponding FORTRAN data descriptors are I9, 1PG16.9 and A8,
        respectively.  Each descriptor must be preceded by a blank.  There must
        be one data descriptor for each specified value (8 maximum) in the
        order of the specified values.

        Enhanced descriptions may also be used:

        Do not begin ``*MSG`` format lines with ``*IF``, ``*ELSE`` ,
        ``*ELSEIF``, or ``*ENDIF`` .  If the last nonblank character
        of the message format is an ampersand (&), a second line will
        also be read as a continuation of the format.  Up to nine
        continuations (ten total lines) may be read.  If normal
        descriptions are used, then consecutive blanks are condensed
        into one blank upon output, and a period is appended.  Up to
        ten lines of output of 72 characters each may be produced
        (using the %/ descriptor).  Two examples follow.

        Here is an example of the ``*MSG`` command and a format to print a message
        with two integer values and one real value:

        The output line is:

        Identifies a macro library file for the ``*USE`` command.  A
        library of macros allows blocks of often used ANSYS commands
        to be stacked and executed from a single file.  The macro
        blocks must be enclosed within block identifier and terminator
        lines as shown in the example below.  If you want to add
        comment lines to a macro block, you may place them anywhere
        within the macro block.  (This includes placing them directly
        on the lines where the macro block identifier and the macro
        block terminator appear, as shown in the example.)  Do not
        place comment lines (or any other lines) outside of a macro
        block.

        The name of the macro library file is identified for reading
        on the ``*ULIB`` command.  The name of the macro block is
        identified on the ``*USE`` command.  The commands within the macro
        block are copied to a temporary file (of the macro block name)
        during the ``*USE`` operation and executed as if a macro file of
        that name had been created by the user.  The temporary file is
        deleted after it has been used.  Macro block names should be
        acceptable filenames (system dependent) and should not match
        user created macro file names, since the user macro file will
        be used first (if it exists) before the library file is
        searched.  Macro blocks may be stacked in any order.
        Branching [``*GO`` or ``*IF``] external to the macro block is not
        allowed.

            numbers, alphanumeric character strings (up to 32 characters
            enclosed in single quotes), parameters (numeric or character) or
            parametric expressions.  See below for additional details.

        Notes
        -----
        Causes execution of a macro file called Name, or, if not found, a macro
        block "Name" on the macro library file [``*ULIB``].  Argument values
        (numeric or character) are passed into the file or block and
        substituted for local parameters ARG1, ARG2, ..., AR18.  The file Name
        may also be executed as an "unknown command" (i.e., without the ``*USE``
        command name) as described below.

        A macro is a sequence of ANSYS commands (as many as needed) recorded in
        a file or in a macro block in a library file (specified with the ``*ULIB``
        command).  The file or block is typically executed with the ``*USE``
        command.  In addition to command, numerical and alphanumeric data, the
        macro may include parameters which will be assigned numerical or
        alphanumerical character values when the macro is used.  Use of the
        macro may be repeated (within a do-loop, for example) with the
        parameters incremented.  A macro is defined within a run by "enclosing"
        a sequence of data input commands between a ``*CREATE`` and a ``*END``
        command.  The data input commands are passive (not executed) while
        being written to the macro file.  The macro file (without ``*CREATE`` and
        ``*END`` ) can also be created external to ANSYS.

        Up to 99 specially named scalar parameters called ARG1 to AR99 are
        locally available to each macro.  Note that the prefix for the first 9
        parameters is "ARG," while the prefix for the last 90 is "AR."  A local
        parameter is one which is not affected by, nor does it affect, other
        parameters, even those of the same name, which are used outside of the
        macro.  The only way a local parameter can affect, or be affected by,
        parameters outside the macro is if values are passed out of, or into,
        the macro by an argument list.  Parameters ARG1 through AR18 can have
        their values (numeric or character) passed via the argument list on the
        ``*USE`` command (ARG1 through AR19 can be passed as arguments on the
        "unknown command" macro).  Parameters AR19 through AR99 (AR20 through
        AR99 in the "unknown command" macro) are available solely for use
        within the macro; they cannot be passed via an argument list.  Local
        parameters are available to do-loops and to /INPUT files processed
        within the macro.  In addition to an ARG1--AR99 set for each macro,
        another ARG1--AR99 set is available external to all macros, local to
        "non-macro" space.

        A macro is exited after its last line is executed.  Macros may be
        nested (such as a ``*USE`` or an "unknown command" within a macro).  Each
        nested macro has its own set of 99 local parameters.  Only one set of
        local parameters can be active at a time and that is the set
        corresponding to the macro currently being executed or to the set
        external to all macros (if any).  When a nested macro completes
        execution, the previous set of local parameters once again becomes
        available.  Use ``*STATUS,ARGX`` to view current macro parameter values.

        An alternate way of executing a macro file is via the "unknown command"
        route.  If a command unknown to the ANSYS program is entered, a search
        for a file of that name (plus a .MAC suffix) is made.  If the file
        exists, it is executed, if not, the "unknown command" message is
        output.  Thus, users can write their own commands in terms of other
        ANSYS commands.  The procedure is similar to issuing the ``*USE`` command
        with the unknown command in the Name field.  For example, the command
        CMD,10,20,30 is internally similar to ``*USE,CMD,10,20,30``.  The macro
        file named CMD.MAC will be executed with the three parameters.  The
        ``*USE`` macro description also applies to the "unknown command" macro,
        except that various directories are searched and a suffix (.MAC) is
        assumed.  Also, a macro library file is not searched.

        A three-level directory search for the "unknown command" macro file may
        be available (see the Operations Guide).  The search order may be: 1) a
        high-level system directory, 2) the login directory, and 3) the local
        (working) directory.  Use the /PSEARCH command to change the directory
        search path.  For an "unknown command" CMD, the first file named
        CMD.MAC found to exist in the search order will be executed.  The
        command may be input as upper or lower case, however, it is converted
        to upper case before the file name search occurs.  On systems that
        uniquely support both upper and lower case file names, the file with
        the matching lower case name will be used if it exists, otherwise, the
        file with the matching upper case name will be used. All macro files
        placed in the apdl directory must be upper case.

        Note, since undocumented commands exist in the ANSYS program, the user
        should issue the command intended for the macro file name to be sure
        the "unknown command" message is output in the processor where it's to
        be used.  If the macro is to be used in other processors, the other
        processors must also be checked.

        This command is valid in any processor.
