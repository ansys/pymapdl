*** ERROR *** CP = 2872.649 TIME= 16:29:51
 One or more elements have become highly distorted. Excessive
 distortion of elements is usually a symptom indicating the need for
 corrective action elsewhere. Try incrementing the load more slowly
 (increase the number of substeps or decrease the time step size). You
 may need to improve your mesh to obtain elements with better aspect
 ratios. Also consider the behavior of materials, contact pairs,
 and/or constraint equations. If this message appears in the first
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.
